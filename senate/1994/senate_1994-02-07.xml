<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I cannot speak on behalf of the cabinet. I look around me and I think I know what some of my colleagues think some of the time, but I certainly would not presume to speak on their behalf. They are all more than capable of doing that for themselves. This morning I was asked a number of questions about the administration of the sports grants program. I did say that I thought it was important that we clarify just how far individuals and committees can delve into the realms of cabinet ministers and cabinets. I believe that to be the case, by the way; I think it would help us all to know.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Trade advise the Senate of the outcome of a review by the GATT of Australia's trade and economic policies which, according to media reports, has delivered a favourable assessment of the policies that this government has pursued? Does the minister think that this means the GATT believes that the government's policies are the right ones? Should Australians be concerned at the reports that Australian tariff policies and the use of anti-dumping were criticised by some of our trading partners?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="427" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE; ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 and 4 February the GATT council conducted a review under the trade policy review mechanism of Australia's trade and economic policies. The council overwhelmingly praised those policies: it found that the government's reforms have worked to address the economic fundamentals and have fundamentally enhanced Australia's productivity and competitiveness. In fact, various participants described Australia's record as `a model for other countries' and `exemplary'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, the assessment by GATT represents not only a recognition of our progress in economic reform but also a fundamental endorsement of our overall approach. In practical terms, the reforms initiated and carried out by the government, and perceived accurately by our trading partners and other members of the GATT, have put us in a very good position to reap the benefits arising out of the success of the Uruguay Round&mdash;the success to which my predecessor, Senator Cook, and his predecessors made such an outstanding contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That GATT round has provided Australia with enormous opportunities. It is now up to Australia to be good enough to take advantage of those opportunities. This GATT policy review endorses, quite correctly, the view that the policies of the government in trade reform, in industry and in other areas have left us very well placed to take advantage of those ample opportunities which will make a significant contribution to our economy. They provide a very solid platform on which to establish our economic and trading future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say there were no criticisms at the margin. Overwhelmingly, it was a very positive review and everybody said so, but there were criticisms at the margin. It is never a sensible policy to close one's ears to criticism, particularly when that criticism comes from trading partners and friends. I think Australia's representatives effectively rebutted the criticisms; nevertheless it is wise that we consider them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, a number of countries raised concerns about the frequency with which anti-dumping and countervailing actions are taken in Australia. In fact, rather than being lax in the application of measures against dumped or subsidised imports, as we get criticised for from time to time in the Senate, we were seen internationally as being too vigorous in the pursuit of anti-dumping and countervailing actions. That, of course, is not the government's view&mdash;we think our laws and practices are consistent with the international rules; they are fully transparent. We do not use them as non-tariff barriers to address these sorts of issues, and they are only used when dumping or subsidisation and damage are proven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, we do not accept the criticism: we think our trade policies are more open and transparent and leave us better placed for taking advantage of the GATT opportunities than the criticisms put to us by the critics. The critics of the policies would do well perhaps to have policies as open and effective as ours. But, overall, this report is overwhelmingly positive and constructive: it gives deserved recognition to the reforms which we have undertaken, and it leaves us well positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the successful negotiation of the GATT round.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of what information Mrs Kelly was seeking, it is relevant to look at the Auditor's power to ask questions of her office as part of auditing the department. That, as I understand it, is a matter of record. She has spoken about it on quite a number of occasions. As far as I know, there was never any attempt not to hand over all relevant documents, and all relevant documents were handed over. There was, however, a question asked of the Attorney-General about the Auditor's power in relation to asking questions of Mrs Kelly and her staff. I do not think there is any need for Mrs Kelly to apologise for that. I would certainly support her in that. That was the tenor of the comments I made this morning, to which Senator Hill referred earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the critical thing to note about what has come out today is that that request for advice was made on 10 June and it was intended to relate to the power of the Auditor to ask questions. That version of events is confirmed&mdash;it is interesting to note Mr Costello did not release the documents to the public even though they were in his possession&mdash;in an annotation on advice by the Attorney-General's Department. That was done by the head of the environment department's legal section and was also in a minute prepared by the then Assistant Secretary, Kaye Dal Bon, on 15 June. In her note Ms Dal Bon says, `Unfortunately Mr Rollinson asked the wrong question. We are aware of the powers of the ANAO to demand access to records, the issue is his powers to command information by way of questions'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I launched the campaign `Let's look after families' in Sydney. That campaign was deliberately chosen by the government as the International Year of the Family campaign because it underlines our commitment to the well-being of Australian families. One of the most interesting and pleasing things about the launch is that the government has been joined by corporate Australia in supporting the campaign.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that, Senator Hill. These are the very features that are disrupted by issues such as domestic violence and abuse of children. They are two of the most important features that we will be looking at this year. If we are talking seriously about safety for families, we address policies to assist them. But most people know that the worst feature of domestic violence and child abuse is that they break down the very core of families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that this is a call to the whole community. If we are to have an effective outcome from the International Year of the Family, it is very important that we have extensive consultation with the people of Australia, that they feel involved in that consultation and that their voice be heard and taken seriously. It involves a partnership of government with all sections of the community, including industry, community organisations, unions and the media.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. I refer to reports that the minister finds GATT approval of Australia's unilateral tariff cuts `gratifying'&mdash;indeed, he indicated as much in answer to an earlier question&mdash;even though 200,000 jobs have been lost. Does the minister intend to comply with the suggestions by GATT, reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, that Australia should, firstly, now act to modify quarantine and sanitary requirements because they are `a barrier for imports of agricultural products'; secondly, give up any idea of sector specific support schemes, notably telecommunications and pharmaceuticals; and, thirdly, cut tariffs even faster on TCF and on passenger cars? As a bare minimum, is the minister prepared to avoid any action which might endanger positive industry initiatives, such as the $500 million Mitsubishi expansion announced last Friday?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="431" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE; ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most delightful contradiction in Senator Spindler's question is his view that our tariff policies are costing jobs when it is in the light of the known policies of the government that Mitsubishi made that very welcome announcement. We welcome that announcement, but it is in the light of and the certain knowledge of what our policies are that Mitsubishi has made that decision. It is not correct to say that those policies are in some way jeopardising that investment. Clear evidence is that they are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is gratifying is not simply that the GATT endorsed the policy framework of the government, but that it recognised the fact that that framework has left us well placed to take advantage of the enormous trade and, therefore, job benefits that can flow from the successful negotiation of GATT. There are various estimates as to whether it will be a $2.5 billion or $3.5 billion increase in GDP that might flow to Australia from the changes in GATT, but it will flow only if our businesses are well placed and have a policy framework in which they can take advantage of those opportunities. We believe they are. The international community has, in assessing them, come to the same view, and it is correct. That is why it is gratifying: because there will be investment, jobs and wealth in Australia as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have not been suggestions by the GATT that we should do any of those things which Senator Spindler outlined, but it is true that some participants in the discussion, in the context of giving an overwhelmingly positive endorsement of our policies, raised some of those issues which Senator Spindler raised. I do not have time to refer to all of them, but the one issue that I particularly want to make a specific reference to is that some people consider that Australia should reduce the rigour of its quarantine protection. I will say unequivocally that we will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of implementation of that is, of course, not my responsibility but that of my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, but I have conferred sufficiently with him to be absolutely certain that his view is the same as mine&mdash;that we will not be undermining or reducing the rigour of our quarantine protection in Australia. Our view is that it is not in any way inconsistent with the proper conduct of international trade. We are open to food imports when they meet our quarantine standards and that is welcome, but we will not allow those standards to be undermined for very good and proper scientifically based reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it relates to human rights. The weekend mortar attack on the main Sarajevo market has been universally condemned as an outrage. Does not the international community now have the moral responsibility to act firmly to end such atrocities and at least to make good the threats to conduct air strikes to protect the legions of unarmed civilians who are the daily victims of this appalling conflict?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mortar attack on the Sarajevo market, where more than 60 people died and more than 200 people were wounded, some very seriously, was, on any view, a despicable and barbaric act. It was not the first of its kind in this awful conflict, but it was certainly one of the worst single incidents of the war. As I said to the ABC yesterday, and I cannot put it personally any more strongly, it seems to me that there is a special place in hell for those who bomb innocent children in playgrounds or women and children and other innocent civilians going about their business in the marketplaces of cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for this particular attack has not yet been able to be definitively attributed and, indeed, it may never be able to be definitively attributed. But I think it is fair to say that the working assumption of the international community is that the responsibility most likely does lie with the artillery of the Bosnian Serbs, who have certainly been responsible for many similar attacks in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: what can&mdash;should&mdash;the international community be doing about it? Certainly, the case for air strikes is becoming more compelling and more irresistible. It was reported this morning that the Secretary-General of the UN has written to NATO Secretary-General Woerner requesting that authorisation be given for air strikes on targets around Sarajevo. That does not necessarily mean they will follow immediately, but the processes of creating the conditions for them have certainly been gone through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a continuing hesitation, however, among members of the international community about the use of such strikes, their effectiveness and their possible implications. I have to say that I find that understandable. The Australian government has certainly not been as critical about that hesitation as some people have urged us to be. The problem is essentially twofold. Firstly, there is the likely immediate effectiveness of the strikes in dealing just with the immediate problem&mdash;in this instance, mortar attacks from the surrounding hillsides. Mortars are extremely mobile pieces of equipment. The nature of the terrain is such that it cannot be assumed that even the most technically effective and efficient air strikes will be successful in removing that particular threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and in many ways more importantly, there are very real questions about the impact of strikes, successful or otherwise, on the humanitarian operations that are proceeding in Bosnia and whether or not the net result would be to possibly increase the level of suffering. That issue arises because there have been threats in the past, and they have been very real, of retaliation against UN forces in a circumstance where, under cover of the UN resolution, such strikes were launched. There is an immediate question about the implications of that for the 11,500 UNPROFOR troops that are in Bosnia at the moment. There is a serious question concerning their capacity, under such assault, to continue to give protection to the humanitarian convoys and relief operations that are presently under way&mdash;it being recalled that there are over 2.3 million people in Bosnia now daily receiving humanitarian assistance of one kind or another from these agencies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of any policy or technical impediment to the provision of UNPROFOR with such equipment. It is the case, I am advised, that experts can often determine from where a shell or mortar has been fired by analysing the crater. There is also mortar locating radar equipment which enables an estimate of location of the source of firing. If the latter equipment is not available to UNPROFOR at this time, there is certainly a case for its provision so that the perpetrators of such acts can be better known than they seem to be at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty about even a force equipped with such material, however, is that mortars, as I have said, are highly mobile pieces of equipment, which always complicates their identification.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question to be asked by Senator Margetts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer the Minister to recent media reports relating to the release of a survey by the New Economics Foundation in London which found that Australia ranked very poorly in an analysis of key environmental issues and ask:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What action is the Australian Government taking to address the fact that Australian households produce the world's highest per capita level of household garbage?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before answering the three specific questions asked by Senator Margetts, I would like to comment on the New Economics Foundation Report that is the basis for her question. Quite simply, the report is so flawed in its methodology that it is misleading in the extreme to rank any one country against other OECD members in the form of a league table. It is not valid to reach conclusions in an overall sense from such an analysis. The report itself contains quite important qualifications on this issue. For example it says, and I quote</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">."While mindful of some valid problems in interpreting the data. . . . . . "</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">."The 11 indicators (on which the scoring was based) represent a relatively ad hoc selection of potential indicators."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could go on. Suffice it to say that the report gathers together data for 11 indicators to produce a score for each country against each indicator. Such an approach is flawed, with no weighting being given to the importance of individual indicators, no real rigour in the selection of the 11 indicators in the first place and an acknowledgment that the OECD figures on which the indicators are based are themselves heavily qualified, due to the virtual impossibility of obtaining comparable figures based on standard definitions for the 24 OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also add that OECD itself is very critical of the methodology used in the article, describing it as "highly misleading".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now address each of Senator Margetts' questions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What action is the Australian Government taking to address the fact that Australian households produce the world's highest per capita level of household garbage?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.I am aware of the survey and have seen the report which uses a dubious methodology to compare the environmental performance of 21 OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Firstly, let me say that I dispute the so called fact that Australian households produce the most garbage in the world. If you look at the report&mdash;and it is clearly acknowledged by the authors&mdash;there are some serious limitations to compiling and comparing data on waste generation from different countries. This because the approaches to the surveying and definition of waste varies considerably. For example, the report states that "some definitions include household waste others include commercial activities, office buildings, institutions such as schools and government buildings".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Secondly, the report quotes Australian data which is more than 5 years old. This ignores many of the significant initiatives which have been undertaken during that period including:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What action is the Australian Government taking to reduce the high level of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carbon Dioxide</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government, along with all State and Territory Governments adopted the first phase of the National Greenhouse Gas Strategy in 1992. The Strategy give particular attention to implementing measures in the energy production, distribution and use sectors where the greatest impact on carbon dioxide emissions can be expected. Australia has already submitted the National Greenhouse Response Strategy to the international community involved in negotiations on the Climate Change Convention as the means by which Australia will meet many of our obligations under the Convention. Implementation of the first phase of the Strategy is already well underway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sulphur Dioxide</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's indigenous fossil fuels are low in sulphur and energy use is not a significant source of sulphur oxide emissions. Our sulphur emissions are derived mainly from smelting of non-ferrous metals such as lead and gold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main environmental impacts of sulphur oxides emissions is the formation of acid deposition or acid rain. The ESD Report on Energy Use stated that `the evidence to date indicates that acid rain is not a national problem for Australia'. The reasons identified in the ESD report include that we have a relatively low concentration fo industrial development, absence of heavily industrialised neighbouring countries and the fact that Australia is endowed with a number of soils having a moderate to good capacity to neutralise acid rain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sulphur oxides do cause local problems (health and material and plant damage) but in Australia they are confined to mining towns such as Mt Isa and Kalgoorlie, but actions are being undertaken to reduce such impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the control of emission levels is essentially a matter for the States, the Commonwealth is coordinating an appraisal of the national air quality goal for sulphur dioxide. The discussion paper recently completed by the National Health and Medical Research Council recommends that Australia's current sulphur dioxide air quality goal is adequate and should be re-endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What action is the Australian Government taking to redress the low level of funding generally for environment protection in this country compared to other OECD countries?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I assume that this question arises as a result of the recently published (25 January 1994) report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Again, before commenting in detail, a few points should be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-only 10 countries were included in the comparison. 14 were omitted. The 10 included were Australia, Canada, US, Japan, Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-the comparisons should be regarded an indicative only, due to reporting difficulties in obtaining comparable data for environmental expenditure from government and industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-the report showed that our expenditure was amongst the lowest within the 10 countries in the survey. However, spending by the Government is similar in level to the other countries, by industry being lower. The report relates to spending in 1990-91 and there are signs that industry has increased its level of expenditure since then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having said that, we should not be too pre-occupied with comparisons between countries of such a crude indicator. Environmental conditions will always vary between countries, requiring different responses from both Government and industry. Indeed, as newer and more efficient technology becomes available to deal with pollution and as cleaner production processes are adopted by the industry, lower level of expenditure on environmental protection may result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Margetts can be assured that for its part the Federal Government will continue to provide sufficient funds to ensure that the high standard of environmental protection that it has established will be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am sure Senator Reid knows, we have been seeking expert advice on specification and implementation of Medicare benefits for bone densitometry for some time. In fact, the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee met last year on a number of occasions to discuss this issue. As is normally the case for health ministers&mdash;I do not believe that has any political colour&mdash;I have accepted all of the committee's recommendations on the provision of Medicare benefits for certain bone densitometry tests, including a series of measures to promote quality and appropriate use of the technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessary determination under the Health Insurance Act is scheduled to go to the executive council at the first available opportunity&mdash;and I think that is later this week. It is intended that Medicare benefits be made available from 1 March for bone densitometry in line with the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee's recommendations. The schedule fee will be $75 per service. There will be ongoing monitoring of what Medicare usage there is of this service over the course of the next 12 months. To accompany the introduction there will be an information package targeting the medical profession and the public, and hopefully that will be provided simultaneously. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of these measures gives effect to the government's 1993 federal election commitment and subsequent 1993-94 budget commitment to introduce Medicare benefits for bone densitometry testing. The estimated financial implications of this are $1.2 million in 1993-94 and $3.6 million in 1994-95, rising annually thereafter depending on the number of repeat scans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory committee recommended that the payment of benefits should be confined to two clinical applications, based on a review of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice. These are, firstly, in the confirmation and monitoring of established osteoporosis and, secondly, in the diagnosis and monitoring of bone loss associated with a specific set of clinical conditions. These include chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and proven malabsorptive disorders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the use of bone densitometry as a screening tool to detect developing osteoporosis amongst menopausal women, the advisory committee concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to warrant the payment of Medicare benefits for this service. I intend to continue to look at that, but that is certainly the state of advice as it currently stands. Safeguards on usage include referral by a medical practitioner, one service only every 24 months and tests on only two types of machines, that is, dual x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computerised tomography.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The general outlook at last week's National Agricultural and Resource Outlook Conference hosted by ABARE was one of cautious optimism for Australia's primary industry and resource industries. Both of those sectors of our economy are set to contribute very strongly to the improvement in the Australian economy which is now under way.

Those predictions are that commodity prices are set to rise in 1994-95 from their current low points. Specifically, prices are expected to rise by seven per cent in 1994-95 and to continue to rise through 1996-97. Australia's economic performance is closely tied to its trade performance and the trade performance of these sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These commodity price rises will feed into improved trade figures for Australia. Rural export earnings are forecast to rise by 12 per cent in real terms between 1993-94 and 1998-99 and mineral resource earnings are expected to rise by 21 per cent in real terms over the same period. Again, as a result mainly of better prices, farm financial conditions are expected to improve markedly with big improvements in farm cash income, especially in the broad acre and dairy sectors of primary industry. This will provide opportunities for farmers to reduce debt and increase their investment.</PARA>

That had already been considered by the MFP corporation&mdash;from last year it had been running and managing Technology Park. The chief executive, Ross Kennan, had proposed that this extra land would enable more rapid urban development, which would create a cash flow. Everybody agreed that this would be good for the commercial development of the MFP. The South Australian government proposed so-called centres of excellence to be added to the MFP. We reached agreement, so long as those centres of excellence are endorsed by the corporation board, and that was agreed to by the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One that has already been announced is information technology at Technology Park. That is within the theme of the MFP as announced 3 1/2 years ago, so there was no argument about that. Some of the other suggestions of centres of excellence will have to be considered by the corporation when they are proposed by the state government&mdash;or anybody else. I point out that a centre of excellence was agreed to last year, called the Ian Wark Centre, at the South Australian university. It is an exploration research centre. One thing the South Australian government did not proceed with was renaming the MFP. I think it proposed the name South Australian Technopolis.

<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans, in response to my questions about the extent of the obligation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to unnamed people for an unnamed amount, even though these were described by Mr Constantinidis, his partner, as pretty serious extra commitments, indicated that we and the public of Australia had no right to inquire about such matters; that it was not our business. He went on to say that it would be a proper interest of the Australian people only if the Prime Minister were involved in personal exertion on behalf of those companies, or if there was a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is exactly on those grounds that it is a matter of public concern. There are several key questions. Has the Prime Minister, either wittingly or unwittingly, used his position as Prime Minister, or Treasurer at some stage, to bring himself commercial benefit? It is a reasonable question. Has his half ownership of his piggery group brought him any benefits because he has had&mdash;and still holds&mdash;such significant offices? Did his half ownership&mdash;and these are proper questions that emerge from this matter&mdash;of the piggery group encourage, for example, the Danes to finally do the deal with Brown and Hatton that they had not, they say, done until he became involved with the Brown and Hatton group?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other people are wondering how the Prime Minister managed to avoid the personal guarantees and personal commitments&mdash;which its former owners had to front up with&mdash;for the $20 million-odd loans to his piggery groups from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a potential for his role as Prime Minister to bring a commercial benefit. That is why it is vital that everything be seen to be above board and be placed on the record. That is why, over a period of something like two years, I have sought to have the facts placed on the record. It was only as a result of my questioning that any accurate information whatsoever on this matter has come forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first statements we saw in this matter revealed that the Prime Minister had a $43,000 interest in this venture instead of a $430,000 interest. Nothing was done to correct that false impression or the false impressions created by false and misleading reports to the Australian Securities Commission. Senator Evans seeks consistently to brush all this aside by saying, `This is muckraking&mdash;unsubstantiated muckraking'. These are the facts which have never been denied and which Senator Evans cannot deny. The screen of muck that the minister is spreading around is simply unsustainable and a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge indebtedness of the Prime Minister's companies represents an unprecedented obligation on any Prime Minister of Australia. It is not necessarily a legal and direct obligation because there is the corporate veil put between the Prime Minister and this massive $30 million obligation. To what extent does this create the potential for a conflict of interest, not even suggesting that the Prime Minister might wittingly be involved in it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If various people in this community took the view that the Prime Minister had very serious financial obligations and something should be done to make certain that he was not carrying the burden of them, there would be potential for  conflict. That would create a potential for conflict, a potential for people to come to the aid of the Prime Minister because of his massive, unprecedented, ultimate obligation. Remember this, the Prime Minister will get the benefit of those huge loans but he is not facing the obligation of those huge loans because of the corporate veil. </PARA>

<PARA>We must be pleased with at least one part of the answer of the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) in that he said quite categorically that the government would not relax quarantine and sanitary requirements, even though they are being claimed as barriers against imports of agricultural products by some of the member nations of GATT. However, I was less than pleased with another part of his answer to my question on anti-dumping actions by Australia, which are claimed to be at a high level. He did not argue that they would be or should be reduced, nor did he suggest in answer to my request earlier that they should be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister should take note that anti-dumping actions taken by Australian companies take up to 12 months, and some take longer; whereas in the United States, because the procedures are much more streamlined than ours, they can take days. Countervailing tariffs can be introduced within five days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all to do with the onus of proof. We require our companies and industries to prove&mdash;and it is sometimes extremely difficult to do so&mdash;firstly, that there is damage; secondly, that the damage is directly related to this particular anti-dumping action; and, thirdly, that the anti-dumping action is related to the cost of production in the other country. Clearly it is not in the interest of that country or of the industries located in that country to agree to it. Our industries are certainly prevented from taking effective action. It might be an indication to the minister of the degree of desperation that our industries are facing that, nevertheless, there are so many anti-dumping actions attempted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that the minister did not address satisfactorily was the request by the other nations to cut tariffs even faster on TCF products and on passenger cars&mdash;I had also included telecommunication products, but that is incorrect. In those two areas&mdash;TCF and passenger cars, particularly the latter&mdash;the minister seemed to be saying that the Mitsubishi $500 million plan of expansion is directly related to Mitsubishi having confidence in and being able to live with the government's car industry plan and with the progressive reduction in tariffs, which will be 15 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all car firms in Australia share either that confidence that this program of reductions will be adhered to or the belief that they can live with it. But let us assume for the moment that Mitsubishi has made the decision that it can do so. The question to the minister was&mdash;and he did not answer it&mdash;whether the Australian government would take note of the requests made by some of the member states of GATT on the GATT council and in comments on the GATT secretariat report that the reductions in tariffs be speeded up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not given us any comfort in saying that the government would reject any such requests; nor has he done that in relation to the TCF products. In relation to TCF products, it should be noted that we are now the only country with a textile industry of note that has removed all quantitative restraints. We still have some tariffs in place. But when the manufacturing costs in China are one twenty-fifth of the manufacturing costs in Australia, even tariffs of 40, 50 or 60 per cent would be of no consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning for a moment to the car industry, I think it is also worth noting that other countries, including some of the ones that have complained about Australian tariff reduction programs in the car industry, have tariffs which are in excess of Australia's current 35 per cent tariff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Reid this day, relating to medicare rebates for bone densitometry testing.</PARA>
<PARA>I think people will be pleased to hear the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) announce at last that there will be a Medicare rebate on a limited basis. The promise by the Labor Party for it to be rebated was made in the last election. It has taken a very long time indeed for this much to come about. But in the giving of his answer, the minister specifically indicated that densitometry testing would not be available by way of checking and testing without previous diagnosis, or words to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to refer the Senate to an answer that he gave to Senator Patterson in October 1993. The question was in nine parts. The first part was the relevant one asking whether the government's budget commitment to densitometry testing depended on funding from states and territories. He answered no to that. But then he went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government has committed funds to improve access to bone densitometry testing through the provision of a Medicare rebate. As funding arrangements for bone densitometry testing will be provided through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), cost-sharing arrangements with the States and Territories are not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA>In the second part of the answer he went on to say, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experts, however, agree that bone densitometry is a valuable test in the diagnosis and management of established osteoporosis and other bone density related conditions. It is on this basis that the Government will improve access to bone densitometry testing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>My question today related to the rebate for those who are affected, or who are liable to be affected, by osteoporosis. It was in regard to the latter part of the answer that the minister prevaricated and indicated that he was still thinking about it, even though he conceded last October that experts agree it is a very valuable test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of testing for osteoporosis is to check as early as possible in the life of a person, when she may be heading in the direction of getting osteoporosis, rather than waiting until the disease is onset. Any woman at the stage of menopause should have the bone testing done. She may then be told&mdash;as I was&mdash;not to come back for five or 10 years. At least that told me something about my condition at that time. It would tell other people as well. It would also indicate at that stage whether a woman was liable to be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the minister to stick by what he said in October 1993&mdash;that the test is valuable. Those who are liable to be affected by it should have the opportunity to have the test done and pay for it and get a rebate. I am not talking about mass screening of the population or anything of that kind. It was indicated in the minister's answer last October that the government was not intending to establish a population based screening program. At least, it should not just stop there. It will be helpful for those who have osteoporosis, or those who have a condition that would indicate to any physician that the person may already have the disease. I welcome that much. I ask the minister not to go so far back on his commitments as to suggest that women who are clearly within the range and age group of those likely to contract the disease cannot go and have this test done and get a rebate for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister must be aware that the population is rapidly ageing. There are more people over 65 years of age than ever before. There are more people over 80 years of age than ever before. These numbers clearly will grow over the next 30 years. The cost and the suffering of older women in particular, who are in nursing homes with broken bones and problems that occur from osteoporosis which has not been diagnosed properly, are enormous, and steps should be taken to at least minimise it, if not defeat it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is doing the government and himself no favour by prevaricating on this issue and not taking it seriously. I urge him to do so, and to take the advice which he gave in October&mdash;that experts are in agreement that it is a valuable test. I urge the minister to do something by way of prevention and not wait for a cure that is not yet available. </PARA>

<PARA>This was not a detailed, technical reply, and therefore it was disappointing, having looked at the text of the prepared answer, that it was kept from the Senate at the time the minister was answering the question, because people would see that it was a detailed attempt to justify the lack of political will and hence of effective action on the very serious environmental and economic problems which are associated with those issues in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The methodology may have had some imperfections, but the fact that Australia is ranked so low must be cause for concern. How can those people doing international studies hope for a detailed or accurate comparative assessment of one nation with another when Australia has failed to provide the information which would have been required to reach such an accurate assessment and detailed comparison?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There need to be fundamental changes in such things as waste disposal and air emissions. At the moment Australia is only tinkering around the edges. I give as an example the lead abatement package which came out and which was based totally on the consumer, basically saying, `Blame the consumer and don't get industry to make any commitment at all to change its act'. Our coal, according to the answer, may be low sulphur, but it is also very low energy. Hence we have to use more of it to obtain the same energy outcome. We do not reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by burning more coal; all we do is considerably increase our greenhouse emissions. How blind can we be? One has to refer only to the decision of the federal government in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> statement to see that it supports the coal-powered power station. The government offered tax rebates to people buying private bonds in a coal-powered power station. What kind of commitment is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention was made in the answer to Kalgoorlie and Mount Isa. Kalgoorlie has not only one of the worst ambient air qualities in the world but also dreadful ground water levels in terms of pollution and cyanide tailing dams which are leaking in all directions. It seems that the situation in places like Kalgoorlie is out of control. Yet the answer says that the government is taking environmental actions in these places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the role of these departments to protect the health and environment of the people of Australia, yet this federal government seems to think we are doing okay. Who are we kidding? We are certainly not kidding the rest of the world when our international statements about our environmental record clearly move further from reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Australia's environmental standards are not enforceable. For all our policies, we do not have the political will or the understanding yet amongst our major political decision makers to make radical changes. We cannot talk about meeting environmental standards unless we change from being a car dependent to a public transport oriented society and unless we increase funding to the better cities program to allow people effectively and efficiently to use public transport. We have cut the funding for these projects. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we stand up in international arenas and claim we are the best in the world? Clearly we are not because we do not balance our actions with our statements. The hope that this country has that other countries will want to purchase Australia's environmental technology will go down the drain because those countries will be too busy laughing at us when internationally our record is shown to be so far away from our statements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the broad thrust of what Senator Margetts just put before us, even though my emphasis might be slightly different. Like Senator Margetts, when I saw the lead abatement package that came to our offices last week, and when I saw it again in my intray when I got back to Perth on the weekend, I was struck by the thought, `Here we go again'. The government is bringing out these very glossy, great big packages of documents with hundreds of little giveaways, pamphlets and so forth, basically espousing all the good reasons we should get lead out of fuel, paint and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps cynically, but I think realistically, I came to the view that again this is the sort of environmental initiative that makes the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) feel good when an election comes around, when someone asks a question in here or when she goes out to schools. She can then say, `This is what we are doing about lead. Here is another pile of brochures; here is some more information'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But, in the same sorts of terms as Senator Margetts raised, we have to ask ourselves: what does that really do about making our environment better for all of us and for future generations? The answer is that it will probably do very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar situation has occurred with the government's policy in relation to reducing the use of energy in Commonwealth buildings. About 18 months ago, the Auditor-General brought down a report which said that the Commonwealth government could save something like $40 million a year if it actually implemented its own policy on energy efficiency. I asked a question on notice about this a few months ago and was greeted by the response that, basically, nothing concrete had happened except that a whole load of audits and so forth were going on. Effectively, in the 18 months since that report came down, the Commonwealth has saved no money in energy efficiency. Of course, if the Commonwealth government is spending $40 million more than it needs to a year in burning up energy, one needs only to think about the amount of greenhouse gas that is going into the environment every day because the Commonwealth government cannot even implement its own policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I seek to make in support of Senator Margetts is that it is all very well having a bureaucracy in Canberra controlling the environment and having a minister who goes around planting trees and launching pamphlets, but unless we actually encourage industries and communities at the grassroots, local community level and business and industry levels&mdash;the government does have a very important role here&mdash;through a whole range of incentives and infrastructure to behave in an environmentally friendly way, a government based in Canberra, often thousands of miles away from where the action really takes place, will not be successful in creating a better environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I encourage Senator Margetts in her fundamental beliefs. I think we share them. Senator Margetts may say that we can achieve a better environment by regulating industries; I would say we should do it by encouraging them and by doing it in partnership, as I think Prince Charles said when he was here last week. We may differ on how we achieve it but, until we focus on ensuring that at the local level and at an individual level&mdash;and, as Senator Margetts would agree, at a household level, where the latest report shows that Australians are very bad at reducing household waste&mdash;we will not achieve the objectives which I am sure all senators and members would share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I received that lead abatement package it struck me that here again is just more propaganda, more rubbish, literally&mdash;I am sure a lot of senators and members would have stuck it in their bins, anyway. A test of that sort of package that comes around to members and senators is: what will it actually achieve in reducing lead in the environment? The real answer is, as Senator Margetts and I both know, very little. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no more important subject that the Senate could be debating today than the gulf between the rhetoric of this government and its record on the appalling state, principally, of unemployment in this nation. The rhetoric of this government is one of social justice, which it defines as a compassionate, fair and just society. That is what it claims to be delivering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to ABS figures, the record shows that just under one million Australians are still out of work. The term of the long-term unemployed in this country is ever lengthening. We have a more divided society than we have ever had before, that is, with the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer; a record of increasing family breakdown, no doubt linked to these unacceptable levels of high unemployment; and rising crime rates throughout the country, presumably linked to the same issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, Mr Deputy President, that the gulf between Labor's record and what it claims is enormous. One of the saddest aspects of this is that it was the true believers whom Mr Keating thanked particularly for his election victory, yet it is the true believers&mdash;those less well off in this country&mdash;who are suffering most under the policies of Mr Keating and his government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a lot in Australia that is wonderful. There is a lot in Australia that Australians find wonderful, but there is a dark side. It is a dark side that this government wishes to avoid. It is this dark side which has come about through poor policy and poor application of policy, which is the subject of this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly drawn to this issue by the release last week of a document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Welfare 1993: Services and Assistance</EMPHASIS>, by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is a document full of substance and good statistical information as to the state of Australia's welfare. What comes out of that document is extremely alarming. It tells us that more than two million Australians are living below what is defined as the poverty level, which is an increase of some 14 per cent since the last decade. These figures were taken from the start of the 1990s when this government, first under Mr Hawke and then Mr Keating, was well into its decade of government. The result is a 14 per cent increase in those living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the numbers of single parent families&mdash;which this government claims to support particularly&mdash;have substantially increased within that category. Half of the nation's single parent families are defined by this objective independent study as living in poverty. It is a major indictment of this government. This report does just what I said a moment ago; it demonstrates the widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country during the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the incidental social information that it brings to our attention is appalling; for example, the fact that in 1990-91 there were almost 50,000 cases of child abuse and neglect reported and investigated by state authorities, of which some 45 per cent of these were confirmed. More than 13,000 homeless people were housed in supported accommodation services. One in four who rent and one in four people aged under 24 were living below the poverty line. These are objective figures produced by an independent and respected authority that should lead this government to hang its collective head in shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) could say was that that information is important and useful for us. He made no acknowledgment that Labor's policies of the last decade have, in fact, contributed to this awful state of affairs. Rather, what Labor is trying to indicate to the Australian people is that, because of the cyclical upturn in the economy, the worst is over and good things lie ahead. For many hundreds of thousands of Australians, that is not good enough. Their future is bleak under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background is this appallingly high level of unemployment which simply continues and continues under Labor's policies. If we take the last figures produced by the ABS in January, we see that the number of unemployed persons in this country is 962,000. The unemployment rate is 10.7 per cent. Unemployment has been more than 10 per cent per month in this country every month since April 1991. For 28 months this country has had to endure an unemployment rate in excess of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are particular groups within our community which suffer more proportionately. For non-English speakers, the figure is up around 15 per cent. If we break it down even further into certain ethnic groups, we find that the Lebanese community has 34 per cent unemployment and that Aborigines have a 31 per cent unemployment rate&mdash;and will not be helped a bit by the government's Native Title Bill. The young, of course, are suffering proportionately more from these terrible figures of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just unemployment. One has to add underemployment to it as well. Again, objective research is telling us&mdash;and I refer to that research done by Associate Professor Mark Wooden of Flinders University&mdash;that there are at least some 600,000 additional Australians who are underemployed. In other words, the statistics really do not tell the full story, because people who work for an hour are off the ABS unemployment statistics. What it means is that we have some 1.6 to 1.7 million Australians who are either unemployed or underemployed. The government wants to forget these figures. They are inconvenient to the image that it is seeking to portray, but it is an image that is inconsistent with its claim of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the saddest part of all this is the trend in long-term unemployment. The figures indicate that those who, unfortunately, become unemployed stay unemployed for longer, almost to the extent where, statistically, they have become unemployable. Recent ABS figures for New South Wales indicate that those out of work for a year or more represent nearly 43 per cent of the total unemployed&mdash;up from 35.5 per cent a year ago. The number who had been unemployed for two years or more jumped by 38 per cent, from 48,800 to 69,000&mdash;that is, nearly 70,000 Australians unemployed for more than two years have been trying to get a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst off are the middle-aged jobless&mdash;those over 45 years. The figures indicate that they are unemployed for an average period of nearly 85 weeks, compared with 78 weeks in November 1992. More than 24,000 of them had been out of work for two years or more&mdash;nearly double the figure of the year before. And so one could go on. Unfortunately, the figures for young Australians are increasing as well. So we have this sad picture of an enormously high unemployment level remaining, underemployment adding to that and those unemployed now being unemployed for even longer periods and therefore becoming less likely to be able to obtain employment. </PARA>

On the unemployment issue, we do not try to escape and run away from the fact that there is more than 10 per cent unemployment in Australia and more than 900,000 people are registered unemployed. We have copped that criticism over the last three or four years.

Over the last three or four months 100,000-plus new jobs have been created in Australia and it is estimated that a further 100,000-plus will be created in the next six months. So we will double the budget estimate on jobs being created in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should always recognise that the decline in unemployment will be made more difficult by some of the structural adjustments going on in our economy, as well as by the ever increasing percentage of people seeking employment. Now we have the participation rate running at around 63 per cent of the work force, compared with only 60 per cent in the early 1980s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general issue of poverty, I draw the Senate's attention to an article that appeared in November last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS> monthly. It was a review of a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living Decently</EMPHASIS>, written by Peter Travers and Sue Richardson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about the social justice record of the Labor government. The legacy of the government is not just a million unemployed. Although I respect the authors that Senator Schacht has just quoted, I do find it a little amazing to hear people saying that poverty is not too bad in Australia. When one understands and knows the human face of that poverty, one certainly cannot make those kinds of assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legacy of the government is not just about the one million unemployed; it is also about those poor Australians who feel very apprehensive and uncertain about the future&mdash;the future for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the term `social justice' can often be academic and is seen to be concerned about all kinds of lofty concepts such as human rights, freedom and so on; but I want to say that today we are debating a very basic and fundamental aspect of humanity. Social justice is about people being able to get food on the table to feed themselves, their children and their family; and about being able to keep a roof over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are large numbers of Australians who find it very difficult to achieve those basic goals. I am sorry to say it, but by any measurement this Labor government has failed the test of really living up to its own rhetoric on social justice. I wonder whether it does have solutions, any more than the opposition does. Our social welfare net seems to be becoming more and more threadbare. Income tax cuts have been given to higher income earners, with the support of the coalition, and yet fuel taxes and other consumption taxes have been raised. These impact on lower income earners because the coalition and the government wanted to pay for the income tax cuts which were given. The tax cuts would have been even more unfair if the Democrats had not been able to achieve an increase in the low income rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really tragic aspect of this debate is that the Liberal and National parties are criticising the government for increasing poverty when they offer no solutions of their own. Looking for social justice initiatives in Fightback is like looking for a needle in a haystack. In that document there are such ideas as cuts in social security payments, throwing people off unemployment payments, throwing women off sole parent pensions and pushing down wages for those in the lower parts of the socio-economic ladder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback has now been replaced by a complete policy vacuum. I look to the coalition today to propose solutions, not just criticise the government. A further contribution to unemployment is a rampant and deregulated financial sector, interested in profit&mdash;not in jobs. This is symbolised by the  total opposition to the notion of having even a tiny proportion of superannuation fund investments directed towards job-generating Australian projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is arguable that there may have been a time when there was a correlation between profits and jobs, but this is no longer the case. The similarity of ideas between the government and the coalition has once again been demonstrated by Dr Hewson's announcement yesterday that the coalition will fall in line with the government's tariff reduction targets. I am sure the 200,000 Australians who have lost their jobs, as a direct result of unilateral tariff reduction policy, will be pleased to note that the coalition presents such a significant alternative. I hope the farmers will be reassured that the National Party is not going to follow that strategy. I give credit to my colleague Senator Boswell; he certainly has fought against that policy on behalf of the sugar growers of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic ramboism is the prevailing theory of economics whose god is efficiency and whose world-wide legacy is poverty and unemployment. This theory views people as expendable and makes enemies of those who end up on the debit side of its balance sheet. I remind the Senate that we do not represent economic theory in parliament; we represent people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest some of the measures that the Australian Democrats proposed for improving the situation facing so many Australians. We have pushed for a greater investment in infrastructure and Australian industry; a fairer and more progressive tax system; and maintaining reasonable levels of protection for Australian industries and jobs against unfair overseas competition. We want to improve and strengthen the welfare safety net by reducing harsh waiting periods, assisting farmers, bringing levels of income payments closer to the poverty line and greater, more accurately targeted housing assistance and improving income support for those on low incomes or without jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every now and again there is a piece of news which the government trumpets as being good news&mdash;and sometimes it is; we have not denied that. But the overriding thing that has occurred with the government's policy and attitude, at least in the last 12 months, is that this group of people, the long-term unemployed, are being left behind and not cared about. They are condemned to being poor, and that is the subject that we are talking about today. One could hardly believe that it could have happened in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of two million unemployed overlooks the number of those who are underemployed, those who have been discouraged from looking for jobs, those in a household where a wife or a husband has lost a job&mdash;and that person is not counted as looking for work and needing work because the other party in fact is employed&mdash;and those who are unemployed but are not counted because they have done some work as a volunteer. In fact, the number is large indeed. The government seems to be prepared to go on doing the things it is and it just leaves these people behind. This figure of two million represents 13 per cent of Australian households. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 794,000 households living in after housing poverty as is set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Welfare 1993</EMPHASIS> review, which has been referred to.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990, there were an estimated 794,000 income units living in housing-related poverty, about 13 per cent of all income units.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the people we are talking about today. These are the people we believe the government should do something about. The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high proportion of one-parent families considered to be in housing need in Australia is alarmingly high. Almost 50 per cent of one-parent families&mdash;families overwhelmingly headed by women&mdash;were in poverty after paying housing costs in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the people that we want the government to take notice of. There is no doubt that as a consequence of this the number of young people who are homeless has risen enormously. Almost half of those living in poverty are with single parents, as I have mentioned. Twenty five per cent of all young people under 25 years live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which stated a conservative estimate of 20,000 to 25,000 homeless youth. However, Fopp, in his report of 1989, estimated the number of children and young people who were homeless or at serious risk of becoming homeless at 50,000 to 70,000. These are large numbers of Australians that we are concerned about. Those opposite cannot have forgotten the comment of the previous Prime Minister on 23 June 1987 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest resource in Australia is not something that we can grow or dig up from the soil. It is the capacity of its people, our great human resource: and above all, the resource of the future&mdash;the children of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we set ourselves this first goal: by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not met, as everybody knows, and it has got worse since that time. It is time that the government recognised this fact and was prepared to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hawke and Keating governments ignored the warning of the 1970s commission of inquiry into poverty pointing to unemployment and family break-up as important factors increasing the risk of poverty. Notwithstanding that, they were prepared to bring on to this country the recession we had to have, with the increased levels of unemployment, which we still have; the growing long-term unemployed; and, as a consequence, the increased levels of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six hundred and thirty six thousand children are living in single parent families, the majority of which are on supporting parent benefits. Five hundred and forty four thousand children in Australia have neither parent or, in the case of sole parent families, their only parent in employment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of children being seriously disadvantaged and the impact of that will live with them for a very long time. Poverty is not just a matter of lack of food and lack of housing, which are the prime matters that people are most concerned about, but it is more than that. It is lack of sufficient resources to participate in the usual activities of the society to which they belong; lack of ability to participate and be an active member of the society; and a feeling of being left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government has the slightest comprehension of what it really means. It talks about numbers. The minister referred to an increased number of advertisements for jobs. That is one aspect but we are talking about the real people who are living in poverty as a consequence of this. Do not forget that women have borne the brunt of much of the increasing poverty and the social inequality which has risen over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about unemployment and poverty; we are not just talking about income. We are talking about the mental and physical health of the people involved, of family stability, of crime rates, of youth homelessness and the capacity of millions of Australians to behave like Australians&mdash;to be a part of this society. There is undoubtedly greater sickness amongst the poor. They are being left behind and the government knows this. In 1988 the government was told about this matter by its own economic planning advisory council. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many low income people, especially families with children, have to survive on insufficient nutrition, are unable to heat their homes in winter, are often unable to afford medication, and are denied most forms of recreation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Labor has abandoned these people and does not care about them. They suffer from a loss of self-esteem, a loss of a sense of value and self-worth, a feeling of not being wanted and a loss of dignity. They are becoming the have-nots in our society. EPAC also told the government that if unemployment was 6.5 per cent there would be 800 fewer divorces. Think of the impact of that upon children. Unemployment still remains at over 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly necessary to have mechanisms to support people who fall into this category and are living in the terms and conditions that I have referred to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could be making genuine industrial relations reforms and work practice reforms. It could be encouraging businesses to invest instead of imposing greater costs on them so that it is impossible for them to survive. It could be making genuine tax reforms.

This government is absolutely committed to the public sector and to ensuring that we provide the social fabric of a society that will support people while they are unemployed.

If we contrast those kinds of statistics with the coalition's record between 1975 and 1983, we find that the coalition's record is one of cutbacks. What was the real change for a sole parent with two children who was renting privately? It was minus three per cent. For a pensioner couple with two children it was minus 2.2 per cent. For jobsearch allowees it was minus 18 per cent. For pension couples it was minus two per cent. </PARA>

Those opposite are merely seeking to distract attention from their own woes&mdash;the fact that there is such division and they are leaderless and without policy. This government has a very strong record and in the next budget those opposite will see many new ideas brought forward to overcome unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this government has created a vast difference between the well-off and the not so well-off. For a party that is supposed to represent egalitarianism by narrowing the gap, it has been an absolute failure. That is not only the feeling of the National and Liberal parties, but also borne out in the recent inaugural report brought down by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It said that two million Australians were living below the poverty line, 937,000 people were officially unemployed, and half the single parents were also living below the poverty line. That is a pretty shocking indictment of the Labor Party. I emphasise that it is not a charge levelled by the coalition but contained in a report of an institution set up by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's responsibility. Labor has been in government for 11 years and cannot blame anyone else. These figures stand as a monument to the government's absolute incompetence on how to manage anything. It has wrecked the small business sector&mdash;the provider of most jobs in Australia&mdash;and it has wrecked the rural sector. What it has provided for Australian unemployed is mickey mouse jobs and a few throw away things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A training levy of 1.5 per cent has been inflicted on small business, and additionally there is a superannuation levy of three per cent on small business, which will increase to five per cent, then eventually to nine per cent and then by the year 2000 to 12 per cent. The Treasury warned the government that that levy alone would cost 100,000 jobs. What did the government do?  It pushed ahead with it and, of course, it has resulted in an unemployment figure of 11 per cent. That figure has fallen slightly to 10.4 per cent because of a recovery that is in no way due to the Labor Party's policies but more to global recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from Senator Reynolds and Senator Schacht that the opposition has no policies and that we are not offering any suggestions. Here are a couple of suggestions in the negative that the government should not be doing. The suggestions are that the government should not impose superannuation levies and training levies, then double that with a big king hit and then again put interest rates up to 23 per cent. The government wonders why it gets record unemployment of one million people and discovers, through one of its own department's findings, that two million Australians and half the single parent families are living under the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any government that has killed the goose that laid the golden egg, it is this Labor government. Because of the present government's policies of which I have just reminded the Senate&mdash;the government's superannuation levy, its training levy, and high interest rates&mdash;the results have been that 100,000 15-to-19-year-olds cannot find work; 16,000 people in this age group have been trying to find work for more than two years; and 6,000 people in this age group have been looking for work for over two years. In the 20-to-24-year-old age group, 31,000 people have never worked at all and 8,000 people in that age group have been looking for their first jobs in two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last year's budget the government committed $120 million, on top of the previous year's allocation of $1.2 billion, to create more jobs. We have jobstart, jobtrain, jobskill, jobclubs, skill care and a few other mickey mouse schemes. In other words, we have the most highly trained unemployment sector in the world. These people are getting sick and tired of being trained for jobs that they will never get. When one talks to them many of them say, `I just couldn't possibly go through another jobtraining scheme. All I want is permanent work where I can earn some money and be an asset to my community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has provided a generation of children who find themselves trapped in the system, without a chance of ever achieving a reasonable position in the community. They are left with temporary housing, caravan parks or are on the street. These are the sorts of things that this new report that was brought down in the last couple of weeks points out. We are not receiving any direction from the government to help these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Senate engaged in a discussion of single income parents. Senator Crowley, because of her need or wish to provide accreditation, has put up a tremendous barrier for single income parents. Women who are single income parents&mdash;half of whom, as the report states, live under the poverty line&mdash;will be forced to pay between $18 and $39 a week extra, or $69 a week extra, to provide their children with child care. That will stop any ambition that they had to get a job. Even if they can get a job now, it is almost impossible for them to put their children in child care while they work because they cannot afford to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that those figures are from the private child-care sector, the profit making organisation. The Sydney Rescue Work Society is an non-profit organisation that provides places for underprivileged children or low income families. Its chief executive did his costings and he believes that those figures will be $25 to $59 a week, or $25 to $32 a week. Those figures apply to a non-profit organisation. This is another example of the government's inability to think things through. The government wanted accreditation and got it because of the support of the Greens and the Democrats. But in essence it has put child care beyond the reach of many parents. </PARA>

I looked forward to opposition senators' contributions to the debate this afternoon, but, again, was bitterly disappointed because all we heard from them was gloom, doom, despair and despondency. There were predictions as to what was going to happen in the future and no indication of what the opposition would do as an alternative to the government's program to alleviate the problems. In actual fact, the contributions were worse than we normally receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell in his contribution talked about small business and rural industry, and indicated how despondent all those sectors were. That proves just one thing: Senator Boswell and his colleagues are not listening to what the community is saying. In the Australian community there is an air of confidence that has been missing for the last few years, unfortunately. Certainly, today, in February 1994, there is an air of confidence and we should be getting behind it and supporting it rather than preaching this continuous gloom, doom and despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust there will be many more debates on this issue and other issues of real import to the parliament of Australia in the coming weeks and months of the sittings. I know opposition senators are creating diversions to keep their minds off the real issues. As to the development of policies by the opposition, I would introduce a note of caution into the debate. Mention was made in a notice of motion today of two million people living in poverty. That figure comes from an Institute of Health and Welfare study dated 1990. It is not a very good survey on which to develop policies. There are enormous errors associated with that study which was released very recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures used in the study document are not real. Gross underestimations have been made of what type of government assistance is available to people. For example, the family allowance supplement&mdash;the additional family payment, as it is now called&mdash;has been increased by 42 per cent in real terms for a family with two children under the age of 13. There has been a 99 per cent increase for a family with one child aged between 13 and 15. In that survey no account has been taken of the implementation of child support schemes referred to by Senator Reid when she was discussing the divorce rate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was the subject of remarks in the Senate on 20 May 1993 by Senator Short (see pages 941 and 942) which were seriously damaging to me. As the Senator himself acknowledged explicitly (page 942 1st column, 5th paragraph), they were based on a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 March 1993. My letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald the next day denying the allegations was not published.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 June 1993 my legal representatives wrote to Senator Short pointing out in detail the many errors in the Sydney Morning Herald article, and consequently in his remarks to the Senate. Senator Short again spoke on the matter in the Senate on 15 December 1993 (pages 4740 and 4741). There are further errors in what was said on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had nothing to do with the arrest or interrogation of Mrs. Magda Bardy and her then husband in Hungary in 1951. Senator Short's claim that I signed the arrest document of Mrs. Bardy's husband was not correct. The documents which it appears I signed in relation to Mrs Bardy and her husband were final decrees, recording administrative decisions made by the head of the State Defense Authority, and in fact prepared for signature by my then superior, Colonel Juhasz. These documents had nothing to do with arrest or interrogation, but came into existence only after a person had been interrogated, and recorded the decision of the head of the State Defense Authority as to what next was to happen to the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from being a Stalinist "hard-liner", I was myself arrested and imprisoned in 1953 by the "hard-line" Rakosi regime as part of a "Zionist conspiracy" fabricated by the Hungarian regime following upon the notorious "Jewish doctors' trial" contrived in Moscow by Stalin. I was tortured for five months to confess to being a zionist spy and conspirator. I was sentenced by a closed military court on other trumped up charges, not maltreating prisoners or preparing false statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was sentenced to six years and served nearly four, before being released on 15 October 1956 by the moderate Kadar regime. The Russian army invaded Hungary on 4 November 1956, and far from seeking to associate with the re-instated "hard-liners", I fled Hungary on 24 November 1956.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I came to Australia on a boat with hundreds of other refugees from the Hungarian hard-line regime, and have lived in Australia under my own name, and have chosen to associate closely, both professionally and socially, with the Hungarian community in Australia, a community which of course includes victims of the sort of behaviour of which I am accused by Mrs. Bardy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee scheme was established by legislation introduced into the Senate on 18 May 1990, and it came into effect on 1 July 1990. It requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme was introduced as part of the government's policy over the last several years to develop the appropriate environment in which Australian industry can become more competitive internationally. A fundamental step in this process is the development of a highly skilled work force which can adapt quickly to major changes in the economy. The scheme is an additional mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. As the signs of economic recovery strengthen, we must be prepared for an increase in demand for skilled people. The training guarantee provides an important underpinning to achieve this skilled work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the principal act to give effect to two amendments promised by the government in the election context and also includes other amendments to minimise compliance costs and give greater flexibility to the scheme. In line with election commitments, the bill provides employers with enhanced flexibility to plan training expenditure over a longer period by allowing excess eligible expenditure incurred in one year to be carried forward to the next year. Although this excess expenditure cannot be carried forward indefinitely, it will assist those employers who have a need to train extensively within a short time frame, but whose training needs may not be so great in the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, and in keeping with the same principle, provision is made for employers who have a training expenditure shortfall in one year to make it up through additional training expenditure in the following year. This avoids hasty and unplanned expenditure simply to meet the minimum training requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also committed itself to remove the need for employers to deduct training subsidies provided by government bodies for apprentices and trainees when calculating their net eligible training expenditure. To avoid anomalies, this provision includes any program with training subsidies. As a consequence of this amendment, the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount, or `deemed amount' as it is also known, has been doubled to preserve the full incentives effect. It maintains ease of administration for employers who choose to claim the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount. Subsequent to the introduction last year of clauses relating to work experience for students and teachers, it became apparent that full-time students 21 years and over were suffering discrimination. The bill removes this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill widens the range of entities which can group for the purposes of the act thus giving organisations greater flexibility to maximise their training opportunities. It also specifies that businesses must be related at 30 June to form a group for that year and that a business cannot be a member of more than one group in a particular year. In order to avoid complications concerning responsibility for a shortfall or ownership of an excess, businesses which group will not have access to the carry forward provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rectify confusion about who is able to design and approve an eligible training program, the bill simplifies these requirements. It specifies that the person or persons who design or approve the program must, between them, have a working knowledge of the subject area of the program and the skills necessary to design or conduct the relevant type of training program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill rectifies anomalies about the use of equipment for training by extending the concept of eligible training expenditure. It will now include rental, hire, lease or depreciation expenses on property or equipment for any part of the year during which the employer uses the property or equipment specifically for eligible training programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill aligns the training guarantee legislation with a recent amendment to the Australian corporations and securities legislation relating to the appointment of an administrator for liquidation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this bill encompasses a number of measures to make the legislation more business-friendly, especially for the small business sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill, as set out in the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum, is to make a technical amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in so far as there is provision in the existing act to appoint state surveyors-general, as they are known in most states, to electoral redistribution committees. This act has to be amended because, in the two fantastic states of Western Australia and Queensland, where as a child I spent almost an equal amount of time&mdash;and during most of my childhood they were both run by conservative governments, so it was a very happy childhood&mdash;it has been decided to abolish the office of surveyor-general.

The coalition has reached the conclusion that it would be better, in dealing with something as potentially contentious as redistribution committees, for us to ensure that we are a little more specific about the people within state governments who are nominated to serve on redistribution committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because that was the overwhelming view of the coalition parties, we have had some amendments drafted. Those amendments were given to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator McMullan)&mdash;who I understand had them looked at by the Australian Electoral Commission&mdash;the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. Last Thursday the minister's office came back to me with a couple of minor drafting difficulties, which we have addressed. Our initial draft amendments have been altered to take into account the difficulties the government had with the drafting. We hope that the amendments are now in a form that overcomes those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I understand that we are probably now dealing with a policy difficulty as opposed to a drafting difficulty&mdash;that is, whether it is better for the act to be quite specific about who is appointed to the redistribution committees or whether we leave it in general terms. I can understand the argument that there is merit in having it more general so that we do not have to come back should the South Australian, Tasmanian or some other government decide to change the name of the officer responsible under this act. However, in view of the small amount of legislative time that is required to go through the process we are undertaking today of appointing someone to a body that can become controversial when it comes to redistributions, there is indeed overwhelming merit in actually being more specific. In the amendments which I foreshadow, in the case of Western Australia we have specified the Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Land Administration and in Queensland, the Director-General of Lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those remarks, I seek the support of senators on the cross benches. I understand that the government is not minded to support the amendments. I had brief discussions last Thursday with Senator Lees. Although we have not discussed it since then, I would urge her support. It is not a life and death thing that the opposition will die in a ditch over, but we think it is a sensible way to go. With those remarks, the opposition will be supporting the bill, which we will be seeking to amend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1993, I would like to go through the current situation so far as redistribution committees are concerned. Following the announcement of a redistribution, the redistribution committee is appointed. For each state, the members of the committee are the Electoral Commissioner, an officer from the Australian Electoral Office, the surveyor-general and the auditor-general. Today we are talking about only the position of surveyor-general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take Senator Campbell's point. Indeed, we spent quite a long time in our party room looking very carefully at this legislation to make sure there could not be any blatant political appointments to what is a very important committee. When we get down to reading the precise wording of the legislation it can be seen that it is quite specific. The Australian Democrats do not believe it can be used to put someone who could perhaps best be described as a party hack into what is a very important committee position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation specifies that the person appointed must have the function of the office, the same as&mdash;or substantially the same as&mdash;or include the functions that would be performed by a surveyor-general for a state. So whilst acknowledging the concerns that Senator Campbell has, we will not be supporting the amendments, even though it would be a relatively easy process to come back here for South Australia, then Tasmania and then maybe New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the opposition's proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill and express my grave disappointment that the Australian Democrats do not see the wisdom of what we are proposing. I think I was the first to raise with our shadow minister the problems in this bill. It really proposes that an unidentified state minister can appoint someone he or she thinks holds an office equivalent to that of surveyor-general to the very important body of federal redistribution committee of that state. I think that is an unsatisfactory process, an unsatisfactory wording. It is far too loose. For the purposes of formations of governments federally, the committee is the most important of all bodies. We will persist with our amendment but, as I say, I am disappointed that the Democrats do not see the wisdom of supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to refer to a few things that are not in this bill. Federal redistributions are one of the most important processes this parliament can discuss. It is an opportunity to put on record some things I think are currently wrong with the redistribution procedures currently in force in the federal sphere. It is true that Australian redistribution processes are, by and large, relatively open and relatively independent, particularly compared with the United States of America, which, as many honourable senators know, has what I regard as an utterly biased and politicised process. The fights over elections to governor are keenly fought because the governor of each state has an enormous influence on the federal boundaries in each state for the House of Representatives. Many honourable senators would have seen the extraordinary electorates that ensue. The United States now has a proposal whereby certain electorates must be majority black, which means that the Unites States has electorates that look like the river Murray and flow in a very thin stream throughout one state in order to gather up enough blacks to form a black electorate. I pray that we never get that sort of nonsense in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the apparent fairness of our system, there are a few anomalies that I wish the government would pay attention to and proceed to do something about. One of the major anomalies is the inconsistency in the use of population between the number of seats per state and enrolment for the actual drawing of boundaries. It is an anomaly that not many people have focused on but one which I think is very significant. Two different sets of numbers are used for the determination of the number of seats and for the drawing of the actual boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see Senator Foreman in the chamber because this anomaly produces a particularly perverse result in South Australia. The South Australian boundaries were, as most honourable senators know, redistributed in 1991. Because of the population criteria that are used, the number of seats in South Australia was reduced from 13 to 12, giving South Australia two fewer seats than Western Australia&mdash;the state most comparable in population. However, if we look at the statistics, we find that Western Australia at that time had only 10,000 more electors but ended up having two more divisions. So we ended up in a situation where Western Australia had only, in effect,  1/8 more of a seat in terms of voters&mdash;that is what we are talking about when we talk about seats; we think in terms of voters; that is, one vote one value&mdash;but, because of this anomaly, Western Australia ended up with two more divisions, or 160,000 effective equivalent votes, than South Australia. So Western Australia now has 14 votes in the house and we have only 12, despite the fact that both states basically have the equivalent number of voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the average enrolment in the 12 new South Australian seats was 80,674 but, in the 14 seats that Western Australia had, the average enrolment was only 69,883 because of this perverse situation. Therefore, a vote in Western Australia was worth a heck of a lot more than a vote in South Australia. That is really not one vote one value. It is an anomaly that I think is ridiculous. In my view, if enrolment is going to be the basis for drawing boundaries, the number of seats in a state should be based on enrolments. So we have a situation now where South Australia has by far the highest average enrolment and therefore a vote in South Australia is worth less than in any other state in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia's average enrolment is now 84,097 voters. The next highest is recorded at 78,677&mdash;6,000 less. In Western Australia, it is only 74,574&mdash;10,000 voters less per seat. Yet, the poor members in the South Australian seats have only the same resources, the same mail allowances and everything else. There are a lot more consequences than simply the worth of the vote. There is also the practical issue of the services provided to members of parliament to service a lot more voters. Of course, Tasmania has only 64,000 voters per seat compared with our 84,000. It really is a very significant issue that I urge the government to pay attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I would like to raise in relation to redistributions is the requirement that the redistribution committee for each state&mdash;which is what we are talking about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">must, as far as practicable, endeavour to ensure that 3 yrs &amp; 6 mths after the Redistribution, no Division will deviate by over 2 % from the average divisional enrolment at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is referring to the two per cent measure at the halfway point between redistributions. I do not know how many honourable senators have actually been involved in the detailed work of trying to draw up boundary submissions to the redistribution committee but it is an extremely difficult job. I, as state director in South Australia, had the task last time of doing it simultaneously with a state redistribution. This particular provision is utterly impractical and unworkable and, in my view, should be deleted from the criteria for drawing boundaries. It makes the task of drawing the boundaries for a state infinitely more difficult. It is ad hoc; it is the tail on the donkey stuff. I am not aware that it exists in any state criteria for drawing boundaries. I think it should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, we currently have the situation where, about a year out from the midpoint, half the seats are well outside the two per cent deviation. The seat of Bonython, where we are about to have a by-election in which the Liberal Party will scare the pants off the Labor Party, is 10 per cent below the projected average enrolment at the midpoint. So in the next 12 months there has to be an eight per cent increase in enrolment in Bonython in order for it to reach this magic two per cent deviation at the midpoint. This is, I would suggest, utterly impossible to achieve. It is certain that several, if not half, of the seats in South Australia will be outside this two per cent deviation by the midpoint, thus establishing that it really is a silly criteria. It makes the process very difficult to achieve and should really be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I would like to raise in relation to redistributions is that of political fairness&mdash;the political fairness of the boundaries. As the Senate would know, currently there is absolutely no requirement at all that the boundaries be in fact electorally fair. It is only by chance that they might ever be so. The only requirement is that they be roughly equal in size in terms of mandatory requirements. This of course can produce extremely unfair consequences, as my two learned and esteemed colleagues from Western Australia would understand. In fact, in Western Australia in 1990 that unfairness was demonstrated more radically than has previously been the case. In that federal election in that state, Labor got only 47 per cent of the two-party preferred vote but eight of the 14 seats. The Liberal Party, with 53 per cent, got only six of the 14 seats. There has been a no more massive demonstration of unfairness than that, and we are not going to put up with the baloney that comes from the government about targeting and better marginal seat campaigns which it knows to be a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Malcolm Mackerras&mdash;putting aside whatever people may think of his capacity to predict election results&mdash;is probably the best analyst of redistributions and boundaries in this country. In the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Greening of Australian Politics</EMPHASIS>, he said in relation to the outcome in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unbiased person, looking at the maps of eastern and Central Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for the recent redistribution prior to the 1990 elections&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">must say they are very fair. The same cannot be said about Western Australia, the map of whose 14 seats was drawn in 1989 . . . There the maps would seem to have been designed to give the Liberal Party six seats which it would win by large margins . . . while the other eight seats would go to Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to describe those seats, and then concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the 1989 redistribution for Western Australia produced a Labor gerrymander.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the point about the supposed `one vote one value' nature of the system, to make electoral enrolments as nearly equal as practicable does not make the system one achieving `one vote one value'. You can still have a gerrymander, as in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mackerras is an independent analyst of electoral systems and he puts it very well. He has exposed the gerrymander that was produced in Western Australia by the application of these so-called fair criteria. The South Australian parliament, under a Labor government to its great credit, has dealt with this problem of unfairness in the drawing of boundaries and has come up with a remedy for that, which I believe worked exceptionally well in the recent state election. In 1991, under the Labor government&mdash;with our support&mdash;the Constitution Act of South Australia was amended to provide as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making an electoral redistribution the Commission must ensure, as far as practicable, that the electoral redistribution is fair to prospective candidates and groups of candidates so that, if candidates of a particular group attract more than 50 per cent of the popular vote (determined by aggregating votes cast throughout the state and allocating preferences to the necessary extent), they will be elected in sufficient numbers to enable a government to be formed.</PARA>
<PARA>There was some controversy about that, but it was a very serious attempt to achieve fairness in the drawing of electoral boundaries&mdash;given that in the case of Western Australia federally, and in South Australia in 1989 at a state level, we have seen how unfair boundaries can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boundaries were drawn accordingly in South Australia, and in the recent South Australian election the Liberal Party scored 61 per cent of the two party preferred vote. The Labor Party needs a swing of 10.5 per cent to win the next South Australian election. In other words, the boundaries are almost exactly fair because a swing of 10.5 per cent against the Liberal Party, thus reducing it to 50.5 per cent, would give the Labor Party 49.5 per cent and that would be sufficient for Labor to win. There is a slight bias to Labor but, by and large, one would have to say that application of that section of the Act has produced remarkably fair boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my strong view&mdash;and I will urge it upon my party&mdash;that we should advocate the introduction of an equivalent section into the rules for drawing federal boundaries. It is a very simple thing to do on a state by state basis. The boundaries can be drawn in a way that eliminates a recurrence of the outrageous position that occurred in Western Australia in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals simply with the composition of redistribution committees. It is too loose; it needs tightening up. I commend my remarks about the whole process of redistributions to the Senate. </PARA>

It is not a matter that this bill or the Senate can do anything about, other than by way of initiating a constitutional referendum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to note that we have before us the Australian Space Council Bill 1993, a bill of great importance to Australia's space industry, yet the minister in charge of its passage, Senator Schacht, is not in the chamber and has sent in his place a junior minister, Senator Crowley, who I do not think would know one end of a space base from another. However, I am rather pleased that Senator McMullan has left the chamber. He was obviously a little tetchy about things this afternoon. No doubt he has concerns about his part in the Centenary House affair, where the Labor Party has leased office space to the Australian National Audit Office, apparently unbeknownst to it. I imagine that something like that would play on Senator McMullan's mind and make him a little tetchy when he speaks in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. Of course, the whole government is under some pressure, which means it is curtailing ministers' speeches. If we take things like that into account, we should make allowances for the Labor Party and the way its members act in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Australian Space Council Bill is to establish the Australian Space Council. The council will replace the Australian Space Board and will report to the minister responsible for space activities and policy concerning Australia's role in space. The establishment of the council will cost the government an extra $2.68 million in annual recurrent funding, and will cover administration, salaries and operating expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to recommendations made in a report into Australia's national space program titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An integrated national space program</EMPHASIS>. The strategy outlined in that report has been generally accepted by the government, and the coalition will not be opposing the bill, which has been based on that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international space industry is primarily concerned with the design, development, manufacture and maintenance of space equipment, together with the provision of ancillary services. There are four main areas of operation: the development and manufacture of satellites for use in areas such as telecommunications, earth observation, and weather forecasting; the manufacture and launch of vehicles to place the satellites in orbit; the construction of ground stations to communicate with the satellites and receive information; and the provision of related services, such as satellite tracking and control services, telecommunications and remote sensing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's annual space budget is a measly $6 million&mdash;tiny by international standards. The big players aside, Sweden spends approximately $122 million and Canada approximately $270 million. A common theme in support of national space programs around the world is that space activity involves a range of leading edge technologies, and that countries involved in these technologies will gain long-term advantages in natural competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Space activities have obvious public good and infrastructure aspects&mdash;for example, communications, weather and disaster forecasting, and environmental monitoring. A common goal of national space programs is to gain and maintain access to such services in the face of market imperfections in the industry. Space research and development also enables industry to develop in a general sense by enhancing its technical and scientific capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government expenditure to assist industry is only justified from an economic perspective if the private sector fails to generate the patterns of activity which would maximise Australia's overall economic welfare, and if government can improve outcomes in a cost effective way. Government expenditure may also be justified if there is a persuasive case for pursuing non-economic goals&mdash;for example, excellence in space science or a contribution to the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its economic evaluation of the space program, the Bureau of Industry Economics, the BIE, concluded that there were only very limited benefits which Australia might derive from the development of space related industrial capabilities, and that the case for a program must rest primarily on the public good benefits Australia might gain as a user of space technology. That BIE report was not accepted by the expert panel looking into this, nor was it accepted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which inquired into satellite launching in Australia, I was pleased to be involved in the investigation into matters affecting our space industry. It was a matter of concern to me that private development of a space base in north Queensland was not assisted by the state and federal Labor governments to the extent that I and many others felt it should have been. That was a great opportunity for an Australian company to become involved in leading edge technology and the establishment of a major space base in north Queensland, but neither the state nor the federal government pulled their weight when it came to giving that company the encouragement it needed to get the space base operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of times during the course of the Senate inquiry into that space base, I told the government that it really had to get involved not by giving direct financial assistance, but by meeting environmental and Aboriginal concerns over the project, and identifying someone or some group with whom the couple of companies that were looking at establishing that space base could get in touch to negotiate its siting in North Queensland. Instead of heeding these warnings and taking a can-do approach to ensure that the Cape York space base development became a reality, the Labor government sat on the fence and left the proponents of the base to wade through an incredible amount of red, black and green tape. As a result, it became just too hard and, in the latter half of last year, the proponents of the Cape York space base abandoned Cape York as a site for their base and chose a site in New Guinea. Because of Labor's political meanderings, hundreds of millions of dollars per year and thousands of jobs which should have gone to North Queensland will now go to Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the Senate inquiry, the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research estimated that a space base on Cape York could have added, in 1988 dollars, about $430 million per annum to Australia's GDP; reduced the current account deficit, again in 1988 dollars, by $184 million&mdash;about the extent of our present current account deficit; and created 4 1/2 thousand jobs in high technology industries in Australia. Those sorts of benefits would have been available for Australian industry had the government taken a more proactive approach to that particular proposal. Australia does not deserve to miss out on the vast economic and scientific benefits which would come from a space base such as that proposed for Cape York. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the bill, the government has taken on board the important outcome of the Senate committee's inquiry into satellite launching in Australia. The committee's report recommended that the government give high priority to investigating the need to establish a space policy council and to providing a strategic and operational oversight of a coordinated national space policy and program, and concluded that a council should provide a more effective means of consultation within the space community and a more efficient application and management of existing space related funding. Notably, the committee's report suggested that, if a council is established, its charter must indicate a clear and positive direction for Australian industry, research institutes and other relevant groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the council will prepare a rolling five-year strategic plan that includes objectives, strategies, costs and benefits of the integrated national space program. I hope that this plan ensures direction and due recognition and assistance to leading Australian space developments. In this regard, I particularly mention the world leading Scramjet project being researched and developed by Professor Stalker and his team at the University of Queensland&mdash;a very important project which will have major ramifications for Australia. I certainly hope that the new Australian Space Council can play its part in encouraging and bringing that very fine project to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the last election the coalition policy on this matter was to pass the resources of and responsibilities for the national space program&mdash;which includes the space office and the national space council&mdash;to the CSIRO's Office of Space Science and Applications. This was to have been overseen by an active space council as currently constituted. Since the last election, there have been changes to the management and structure of COSSA and the management and nature of the space office. As a result, existing coalition policy has been suspended for the time being. The most appropriate policy position for us would now be to look at the operations of the space council and the space program when we return to government. Until that time, we certainly hope that the current proposal results in a positive move towards promoting a national science policy and program. On that basis, the coalition will not oppose the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As already pointed out by the minister in his second reading speech and by Senator Ian Macdonald, the Australian Space Council Bill is a machinery bill which gives effect to various historical events. The government created a space board and now this bill seeks to replace that with the Australian Space Council. This was anticipated in the Madigan report of 1985, after which the Australian Space Board was formed; it was also a result of an investigation by an expert panel in 1991-92, which recommended an integrated national space program in a report tabled by the former industry minister, Senator Button. The government's response to that was to accept one of those recommendations, which is to change the organisational arrangements and to create the Australian Space Council, with which the Australian Democrats entirely agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Macdonald pointed out, the bill also provides for a wide range of representation from industry and research bodies on this council to fulfil the varied requirements of government, industry and research into space and the different interests of the Commonwealth and the states. It was also pointed out by Senator Ian Macdonald that at the moment the council's program is only a small $6 million a year, but that also included in the funding is the $15 million from NASA for the deep space Tidbinbilla complex which carries out some very important research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up a couple of other points which were also touched on by Senator Macdonald. Looking at the proposals which have been around for some years for a space base at Cape York, one finds that changing technology has probably superseded that base. The reason for going as close as possible to the equator is to pick up the spin of the earth so that less energy is required to launch heavy vehicles into space. When the Democrats looked at this during the number of years that it was a current proposal, we worried a great deal about its economics and thought, on all our calculations, that that base would have to accept military launches to make it economic. It was a heavy vehicle launching facility, expensive and, contrary to what Senator Macdonald said, the economics looked rather dubious. In the light of that, the considerations of Aboriginal interests and the environment loomed very large indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would, however, agree with Senator Macdonald on Professor Stalker's Scramjet proposal. This is an exciting development which would allow the launching of very light satellites, light vehicles, from virtually anywhere with very little ground backup and support. So the costs of such launches would be low and would not necessarily have to be done from near equatorial launching stations. For instance, Woomera would be a perfectly suitable place for these launches because, unlike the heavy vehicles launched more directly into space, the Scramjet requires a low trajectory through the earth's atmosphere to attain the escape velocity. I agree with Senator Macdonald's call for more support for Professor Stalker and his Scramjet developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a uniquely and totally Australian development. The heavy vehicles which would have been launched from a station on Cape York would have involved a great deal of overseas technology. I certainly believe that we should be supporting Australian developed technology and seeing that it could be used here. That would give us&mdash;if the Senate will forgive the pun&mdash;a launch pad from which we could go into overseas markets with Australian technology rather than importing technology from overseas. So we will be supporting this legislation. We think it is desirable for Australia to push ahead with its own technology in space which, as far as I am aware, particularly involves Professor Stalker's work in the engineering faculty of the University of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both speakers for their support of the Australian Space Council Bill. I will not comment on Senator Ian Macdonald's ungracious remarks at the start of his speech. He soon warmed to the subject. I do not know why I have the short straw of having to listen to him on two successive bills, but I guess I am just lucky.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note Senator Macdonald's and Senator Coulter's remarks on the Scramjet. If I am right I have seen its prototype of it at the North Queensland Shipyards. It is quite exciting, certainly for the next generation of politicians who will be able to get to London in an hour for a CPA conference. It will be of enormous benefit in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald mentioned that the Liberal Party had a policy&mdash;which it has now suspended&mdash;on this at the last election. That is true to form. I was most surprised and delighted to hear him say that he had an open mind on this subject. I think that development should be at least marked and noted for the record. I congratulate Senator Macdonald on having an open mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also supported the proposal. I think Senator Coulter at one stage described himself as the James T. Kirk of the Australian Democrats. I will not make any remarks on the next generation of that. This will not be an easy area to break into; I do not think anyone has any illusions about that. Senator Coulter remarked on the potential use of Woomera into the future. Certainly that has been looked at on several occasions. I hope it is looked at again, for I do not think the Nurrungar base will be there forever. I doubt it will be there at the end of this century. Therefore, developing alternative uses for what are quite good facilities at Woomera, be they of this nature or other scientific natures, I think will be of great benefit in future. So, very peripherally, as Minister for Defence, and having an interest in Woomera and the current purposes that basically exist, I would be delighted to see alternative uses so that the township remains viable and can continue in the future. I thank honourable senators for their support of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill provides for the Commonwealth to assist the Queensland government in the management of the wet tropics world heritage area of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Premier of Queensland formed an agreement named the wet tropics management scheme, relating to the management of the wet tropics area. This agreement allowed for the creation of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, a wet tropics management agency, which has since been merged with the Wet Tropics Management Authority, a community consultative committee and a scientific advisory committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the terms of this agreement were enforced by the Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection and Management Act which was passed through the Queensland parliament in 1993. As Queensland legislation cannot bind the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth needs to implement complementary legislation in the terms of this agreement to allow the agreement to work to its full extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Commonwealth legislation is intended to cover a range of matters, including the Ministerial Council, the two committees and funding, it was decided that, as most of these matters were covered clearly by the management scheme, the Commonwealth legislation would be kept brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth bill covers three matters. Firstly, it enables the Commonwealth minister to nominate two members to the six-member board of directors of the Wet Tropics Management Authority; secondly, it enables the Commonwealth minister to make available to the Wet Tropics Management Authority Australian public service staff; and, thirdly, it provides for an annual report of the authority to be tabled in the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics of Queensland world heritage area covers some 900,000 hectares of rainforest between Townsville and Cooktown along the North Queensland coast. The wet tropics rainforests were world heritage listed in December 1990. No-one in north Queensland has ever questioned the need to protect the wet tropics rainforest. However, there was controversy originally about the manner in which the Labor governments, both state and federal, approached the listing. Honourable senators may recall that in those days there was a very great concern about use of foreign affairs powers to enforce the world heritage listing, contrary to the wishes of the Queensland government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a very great concern about the drawing of the boundaries of the wet tropics rainforest. As I have said many a time, no-one really objected to the listing, but there was a lot of concern about the boundaries and how, through the actions of the government, many livelihoods, small businesses and the town of Ravenshoe were almost completely crucified. Even today, the effects of those listings on business people and workers in Ravenshoe can be felt. In fact, Ravenshoe at the moment has one of the greatest social security problems per capita of any place in Australia. That is principally a result of the work that was taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the sum of $8 million of Commonwealth funds, taxpayers' money, which through mismanagement of this government just disappeared. In spite of many attempts to explain that over the years, nothing eventuated except to show that this government was not capable of managing even that relatively small amount of money. I understand that there are proceedings in the courts at the present time, and we await the outcome. Since that time things have settled down a bit. Any controversy now with the wet tropics centres on the way the listing has been made by the Wet Tropics Management Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a general feeling in the community in North Queensland that the Wet Tropics Management Authority is doing as good a job as it can, as part of an archaic bureaucratic environmental management system which has not kept pace with the environmental progress in the region. This comes as no surprise, as the Wet Tropics Management Authority is essentially embedded in the Queensland government's Department of Environment and Heritage. The board of directors answers to the ministerial council comprising two state ministers, Mrs Molly Robson, the Environment Minister, and Mr Ed Casey, the Primary Industries Minister in charge of forests, and two Commonwealth ministers, Mrs Kelly from the environment portfolio and Mr Michael Lee from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am permitted, I might say&mdash;and I hope no-one will think this is sexist; it is just the way it happens&mdash;that it is somewhat fortunate that Mr Casey and Mr Lee are able to be involved in that council in order to keep Mrs Robson and Mrs Kelly from some of their more outrageous proposals in relation to the environment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to consider some of the more extreme environmental pressures on both the state and federal governments. Senator Reynolds will be well aware of this, coming from the Labor Party in North Queensland where there is an unholy row about environmental matters&mdash;one of which is the Tully Millstream. A lot of the Labor people in North Queensland believe that it is essential for jobs and secure power but there is another element of the Labor Party, captives of the radical Greenies, who will not let it happen. So there is an enormous problem in the Labor Party in North Queensland. Senator Reynolds will probably tell us about that later. It is good that Mr Casey, the state minister for primary industries, and Mr Lee are to keep a balance on that ministerial council to make sure that tourism and forestry aspects are properly brought to the fore in the discussions on the wet tropics management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns in the local community is that the Wet Tropics Management Authority is seen by some as unnecessary because it overlaps the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This is true for about 30 per cent of the world heritage rainforests, which are in national parks and controlled by the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage, whilst more than 40 per cent of the world heritage area is in the state forest area and is controlled by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. It is obvious that there must be some overlapping in the roles performed by each of these controlling bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The roles of the organisations are essentially different in that national parks and the state forest office take care of the more day to day practical management tasks while the Wet Tropics Management Authority takes a planning and overseeing role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern in the community is that the authority spends a tremendous amount of taxpayers' money and at times there is little to show for it. For the three years the authority has been in operation up until November 1993, the Commonwealth government will have provided it, under the guidelines of the management scheme, with $10 million for capital works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is also obligated to provide the authority with annual recurrent funding which is matched by the Queensland government. Since its establishment, the authority has received approximately $4 million per annum from the Commonwealth government. This $4 million has been matched by the Queensland government, which has provided $2.5 million per annum from treasury funds and $1.5 million in in-kind funding. This funding actually bypasses the Wet Tropics Management Authority and is spent by the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some concern, of course, with any funding arrangements in which Mrs Kelly is involved, because we know what happens when Mrs Kelly gets involved in funding arrangements. She will not have any trouble here because she is only interested in marginal seats. Regrettably, for the present at least, the wet tropics are in two, possibly three, marginal seats: Leichhardt and Herbert and, to the rear and to the western section, a bit in Kennedy. Mrs Kelly will find it very easy to spend the money there without being accused because I do not suppose she can spend it anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember only a few months ago when Mrs Kelly promised to match the Queensland government funding for the buyback of the Starcke property from the developer. Senator Reynolds will remember this instance well because Mrs Kelly promised to provide matching funding. So the Queensland government went ahead believing that the Commonwealth would provide dollar for dollar, which is matching funding. Then it turned out that Mrs Kelly was not quite so concerned. She said, `I am not making that commitment. What I actually meant by matching funding is joint funding.' What joint funding means is actually `some kind of negotiation and consultation'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there was Mrs Kelly again making a commitment to the Queensland government for matching funding and then trying to interpret the words `matching funding', which are pretty clear to most of us to mean joint funding, but which actually means some kind of negotiation. It is no wonder that Mrs Kelly has again shown her incompetence with the sports rorts affair as she did at the time of the commitment to contribute to the Queensland government in the buyback of the Starcke property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By November 1994, the authority will have received a total of $29.5 million in direct funding since its establishment. When we are in government, Mrs Gallus, the coalition's shadow minister for the environment, will closely scrutinise this expenditure to ensure that we are getting value for money. We will be supporting the type of work being done and Mrs Gallus will no doubt be looking at improving the service. But we will always be open to suggestions on how the service can be more efficiently delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority's expenditure is separated into four different categories: heritage conservation, management planning, community relations and corporate support. The authority's expenditure for the three years that it has been in operation is as follows. For community relations, which deals with such activities as community education, community research, planning, Aboriginal issues and infrastructure maintenance, $7.34 million was spent. For heritage conservation, which involves activities such as fire management, ferals and weeds, endangered species and cultural and heritage issues, only $5.49 million has been spent. For corporate support, which involves administration and wages, $5.36 million has been spent. For management planning, which involves such things as strategic plans for the Daintree, visitor monitoring and landscape architecture, $1.57 million has been spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority's large total expenditure on community relations is of concern in that a proportion of these relations involves self-promotion. It is of interest that the authority has only recently begun spending more money on heritage conservation than it has on community relations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some groups in the community feel that the authority should spend more time in its job as a strategic planner and manager rather than in self-promotion and lobbying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a recent visit to the Wet Tropics Management Authority, where I was warmly and kindly met by the director&mdash;and I thank him for his courtesy&mdash;I was rather nonplussed to be told by him with some pride that the authority had just conducted a poll and it found out that its public acceptance had increased remarkably over the last few years. I could have told it that. Since the early days of world heritage and since it has been out of the news, it is obvious that most people have forgotten the angst that they felt towards that whole system, which should, of course, have been directed to the government, not to the authority. That has dissipated and people now see the authority as generally doing a pretty good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised that this poll involved a very substantial sum of money&mdash;the director did tell me the amount, which I have not retained&mdash;and I wondered whether perhaps that amount of taxpayers' money would not have been better spent on something that protected the environment rather than carrying out a self-promotional exercise by indicating and polling to see how popular the authority was in the north Queensland community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wet Tropics Management Authority's budget for 1993-94 allocated $5.7 million to community relations; $6 million to heritage conservation; $2 million to corporate services; and $1.3 million to management planning. The total expenditure is $15.1 million, which includes $7.5 million in new funding from the Commonwealth government, of which $4 million will be recurrent funding and $3.5 million as a proportion of a $10 million capital works funding for the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that this figure of $7.5 million in Commonwealth funding&mdash;the minister might clarify this for me&mdash;which is shown in the budget statements of the Wet Tropics Management Authority is quite different from the figure given in the program estimates by the department of environment of $8.5 million. I do not have the page number but the estimates documents that we were given clearly show that the Commonwealth contribution is $8.5 million and yet the Wet Tropics Management Authority shows in its budget that it is getting only $7.5 million from the Commonwealth for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a million dollars missing somewhere. I am always suspicious, as I say, with Mrs Kelly and money and with what happened at Ravenshoe with the $8 million. Perhaps the minister might be able to elucidate for me on the difference between the two figures showing $8.5 million going out of the Commonwealth coffers and yet only $7.5 million coming into the Wet Tropics Management Authority. There may be a simple explanation. If that is the case, no doubt the minister will clarify that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other major concern that I would like to mention in the time available to me is the concern in North Queensland that there are far too many different organisations, rules and regulations and separate approvals involved in setting up and running an operation or developing in North Queensland's environmentally sensitive areas. An operator may have to pass through world heritage land under the Wet Tropics Management Authority, national parks land under the Department of Environment and Heritage, state forest land under the DPI, shire land under one, two or perhaps even three or four councils, and endless other regulations involving crown land and crown leasehold. On top of this, there is now the uncertain effect of the Mabo legislation on operators wanting to do things in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each of these different types of land an operator has to get different types of approvals and abide by different rules and regulations. One operator that I spoke to in the area told me that he had to get more than 50 different permits and approvals to put into operation one single tourist activity. Many of those different approvals were contradictory. One department would say that he had to do this and another department would say that that was prohibited. It is easy to imagine the confusion which is created and the resources which are wasted with such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is so inefficient that preventing and delaying reputable tour operations actually encourages environmental degradation. A tourist unable to secure a seat on a tour to the Daintree because the tour has not been able to get new approvals as a result of all this red tape can actually hire a four-wheel drive vehicle and go belting around the rainforest destroying everything in sight. Yet if the person were part of an organised activity, that would not be possible. The individual in the four-wheel drive will cause the sort of damage to the rainforest that we do not want to see and, unfortunately, that problem is increasing. One of the ways to overcome it is to allow more responsible operators greater access to those areas. It is time that people realised that tourism operators in North Queensland are experts in environmental preservation and are leaders in ecotourism. They have a real interest in preserving and maintaining the environment because they rely upon it for their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics authority is caught up in the current system in that many of its regulations differ from those of other authorities. One particular case comes to mind where an operator wanted a boardwalk extended at Oliver Creek in the Daintree. The wet tropics authority okayed the extension but then the operator went to national parks for approval and it refused it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One approach to solving such problems may be to make further investigations into a multitenure arrangement or a one-stop shop so that operators have to secure only one approval from one authority which controls all environmental activities in the one region. The disarray in the system stems directly from the fact that, in my view in my submission, the governments, both state and federal, are completely out of touch with real environmental issues in North Queensland. They have no idea of the potential for ecotourism and the development of the Far North and have lost the ability to legislate effectively in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this respect that I urge the board of directors of the Wet Tropics Management Authority to be stronger in its recommendations to the ministerial council. I further urge consultations between the Wet Tropics Management Authority and its board of directors, the ministerial council and tourist operators. Only by getting together more closely with the people directly involved can we get the sort of legislation that supports tourism, supports a multimillion dollar industry in Australia and yet, at the same time, protects the wet tropics areas and the environment in North Queensland generally. I certainly urge the ministers on the consultative committee, particularly Mr Lee and Mr Casey, to be more pro-active in their role in getting some commonsense resolution to the impediment placed upon the sensible expansion of ecotourism in the wet tropics areas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Wet Tropics Management Authority for the work that it has been doing. Certainly the Wet Tropics Management Authority started out its life in a difficult climate because the listing of the wet tropics was regarded as controversial and it polarised the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Ian Macdonald questions the sampling of public opinion, I think it is very enlightening to find that, five years after that great debate about the listing of the wet tropics, there is an 80 per cent approval rating for the fifth birthday of the wet tropics. I think it demonstrates the very fine work of the management authority and, indeed, the very fine work of ministers responsible for the management authority, both of whom, I am pleased to say, are women, and exceedingly competent women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to take issue with Senator Ian Macdonald that, while Mr Casey and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) bring skills to their role on the ministerial council, I certainly do not agree with his derogatory comments about the two women ministers as needing this balance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the Wet Tropics Management Authority itself, I must say that a great deal has been achieved in the last two years. I would like to run through some of the key achievements of the management authority. They are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to talk a little about the survey which identified this 80 per cent approval rating for the wet tropics because it is significant and it is important to ensure that it is on the public record. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wet Tropics Update</EMPHASIS> lists the highlights as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">57% of north Queenslanders say the World Heritage Area is having a positive effect on local communities, only 16% perceive a negative effect.</PARA>
<PARA>That is perhaps the most revealing statistic of all. Fifty-seven per cent of North Queenslanders say it has a positive effect and only 16 per cent perceive that it will have a negative effect. There has been, the update states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant increases in satisfaction with information provided and progress in decision-making. Tourism and environmental protection seen as the major benefits. Generally support and other indicators are highest in Cairns and Townsville, and lower on the Tablelands and communities south of Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA>In recalling the issues of ensuring that the wet tropics would be listed, I well remember the doubts that many people had. Therefore, I am particularly interested to see that the benefits are now perceived as by far outweighing the disadvantages. These are the benefits in order of rating by this survey:</PARA>

<PARA>In speaking to this bill, I believe there are a number of issues that we need to consider. There are two proposals for development in the wet tropics area. One has received a great deal of publicity in the past, and I believe will receive more publicity in the future if we cannot work our way through and find a more satisfactory outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald mentioned the Tully Millstream hydro-electric scheme. On a number of occasions this has been raised as being essential to development of the north. Quite clearly, without going into great detail, the scheme is unnecessary and would be an environmental disaster. No-one could take seriously our commitment to the wet tropics if that scheme were to go ahead. Some of the problems identified with this scheme are that the QEC demand projections, on which the scheme is based, are unreliable and do not take into account COAG greenhouse targets adopted in 1992. The impact on the catchment of the Tully and Herbert rivers are severe, and the impact on the wet tropics area would also be severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new project that has been proposed is the skyrail project. Again, there are a number of objections to the skyrail project as currently proposed. While I do not claim to be an expert on the proposal&mdash;and I want to have a much closer look at it&mdash;I would point out that there are a number of issues about it that concern me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about the commercial exploitation in a world heritage area. I would far prefer to see the Kuranda railway maintained and upgraded than to rely on the private sector to exploit an area. Perhaps I could be convinced otherwise, but at the moment I am not convinced about the skyrail project as proposed. Certainly the organisation PAKS, People Against Kuranda Skyrail, is mobilising its forces to identify some of the problems that presently exist with the skyrail project as proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major things that would concern me is that it would detract from the Barron Falls vista and take passengers away from the Kuranda train, thus denying people an existing and acceptable rainforest experience. This would result in further financial losses and eventual train line closure, thereby cutting off the goods train link to the tablelands. I worry when governments back off and the private sector comes forward. The wet tropics is unique. It should be possible to maintain that Kuranda service, which is so popular. If there is some doubt about that by providing this alternative initially, what about the long-term effect? It is also claimed that the skyrail project threatens to obstruct the Black Mountain wildlife corridor at its narrowest point, which is a connecting link between the Tully and Daintree rainforest regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of major concern is that the Djabugay people, indigenous to the area, do not want the skyrail. They have not been consulted and are most unhappy about the proposal, as presently claimed, going ahead. I emphasise that final approval into the present proposal has not been given. Perhaps there is a way of negotiating through some of these totally unacceptable features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that has been raised is safety. Would the skyrail be completely safe? In the event of a breakdown, would rescue methods be adequate? I do not know the answers to these questions. It is claimed that these are some of the issues that have not yet been fully explored. I believe that when we have an area that Australia is caring for&mdash;not just on behalf of North Queenslanders and indeed of all Australians but because we are the custodians of a world heritage area&mdash;then any tourist proposal such as skyrail has to be very thoroughly analysed. We have to look not just at what the proposal would be in 1995-96, but also at what it would mean in the future. I am pleased to support the legislation, but I hope there will be greater scope for debate about some of these very sensitive proposals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats welcome the debate on the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill 1993. The environmental values of this magnificent area are beyond doubt. I stress that even Senator Ian Macdonald, at long last, is praising the values of this area. As David Attenborough said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland rainforest is one of the most breathtakingly wild areas in the world; unbelievably beautiful, unbelievably interesting. There are birds, mammals, and plants there that are unique. Beyond any dispute, it is a treasure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics of Queensland span an area from Townsville to Cooktown. They encompass an amazing array of forest types, from mangroves, paperbarks, to tall open forests and tall medium and low woodlands. They also contain an amazing diversity of species. Although the wet tropical forests cover only 0.1 per cent of the Australian continent&mdash;and I stress this figure because very often the pro-development exploiters in our midst will say, `This activity will only damage 0.1 per cent or smaller areas'&mdash;they contain 25 per cent of all plant genera in Australia. Approximately 62 per cent of butterfly, 60 per cent of bat species, 30 per cent of marsupial species, 23 per cent of reptile species, 18 per cent of bird species, and 92 per cent of known fern genera are found in that area. Species totally unknown to non-Aboriginal Australians continue to be found almost on a month by month basis. The area also contains over 400 species of rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species. It is, therefore, vitally important that this area not only be protected as a World Heritage area, but also be properly managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics are an outstanding example of a major stage in the Earth's history, having survived through millions of years in a moist environment similar to that of Gondwanaland. Only in the rainforests of north Australia, and possibly in New Caledonia, have these conditions been continually maintained since Gondwanaland. The wet tropics now contain the highest concentration of families of ancient flowering plants in the world. It is a magnificent laboratory for those who want to research the evolution of flowering plants throughout the whole of geological history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knowing all this, it is staggering to realise that in the 200-odd years since Europeans occupied Australia, three-quarters of the rainforests have been cleared. It is astonishing to look back from our perspective in history at the extent of destruction which occurred until only a few years ago. The protection of the remaining rainforest was, without doubt, one of the highlights of the small assortment of federal government conservation initiatives during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The path to its conservation was not an easy one. A rescue the rainforest campaign was launched by the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1982. In 1983, campaigners targeted the construction of the road through the Daintree from Cape Tribulation to Bloomfield, a road which was nothing short of environmental vandalism. It is interesting to look at the way in which the membership of the Mulgrave Shire and the direction taken by that shire have substantially changed in recent years. In 1984 the rainforest campaign highlighted the logging at Downey Creek, an area of immense beauty. In 1986, conservation groups came together and called for the whole wet tropics area to be protected. During the entire campaign the then National Party government gave full support to the destruction of the forests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June 1987, World Environment Day, the former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, announced that the federal government would nominate the wet tropics as a World Heritage area. This infuriated the Queensland government which then threatened to challenge the Commonwealth in court over the Commonwealth's power to stop logging in the area. However, the state government went to water, and in 1988 899,000 hectares of wet tropical rainforest were inscribed on the World Heritage List. The victory was sweet for all those who had worked so hard on the campaign&mdash;they being the real workers, Senator Boswell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 November 1990, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments signed an historic agreement for the management of the wet tropics World Heritage area. The agreement was to establish a ministerial council to coordinate policy and funding at a government-to-government level; to establish a wet tropics management authority to be responsible for achieving the implementation of Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention; and to establish a wet tropics management agency to be responsible for the ongoing management of the World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I have to say that four years on there is still not a management plan in place. I think this reflects very poorly on the way in which this government has established World Heritage areas but has not been particularly rapid with the development of management plans. It is not surprising that this has allowed opposition to the idea of World Heritage nomination to grow. We have seen this most recently in the case of the Lake Eyre Basin and the proposed nomination of areas of the Nullarbor Plain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a plea that the government needs to move ahead with the establishment management plans for those areas that have already been inscribed to establish in the public mind the fact that World Heritage does not mean many of the things which have been claimed for it. Many of the scare campaigns which have been run indicate that people have been led to believe that World Heritage necessarily means the cessation of all development, the stopping of everything and no activities whatsoever. This is despite the fact that in the case of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park there is a continuation of many activities which are highly profitable, such as tourism, commercial fishing and recreational fishing. Those activities, provided they are properly managed, are quite compatible with the maintenance of the area as a World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the plea at this point that the government moves ahead with the proper and rapid development of management plans for areas like the wet tropics or the Willandra Lakes and at least in outline form for those areas it would wish to have inscribed on the World Heritage List, such as the Nullarbor and Lake Eyre. Only in that way will those fears which many people quite rightly hold be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the issue of the wet tropics, Commonwealth funding was provided to the Ravenshoe area to start up alternative employment for those people affected by the prohibition on logging. Senator Boswell will recall that we joined with the opposition in moving a successful motion of no confidence in the then minister over the mismanagement of some of this funding. The former rainforest loggers then began to plant rainforest trees and the bitter disputes between loggers and conservationists that marked that early dispute throughout the mid-1980s have gradually subsided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might digress for a moment by saying the lessons of the wet tropics do not appear to have been learnt by this government in relation to other Australian rainforests. Protests are occurring this summer in the World Heritage quality temperate rainforests of Tasmania and in the old growth and wilderness rainforests of East Gippsland, yet the Minister for Resources late last year signed away many areas of old growth forest and wilderness to the woodchip industry. The conflict in the forests will only be removed once the federal government intervenes&mdash;as it has done in the past when the political will has been there&mdash;to stop logging in old growth forests, ensures their protection and encourages the development of a plantation-based industry. Only in plantation forestry will there be a viable and sustainable future for forestry and timber production in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again refer to the Mulgrave Shire where there has been this dramatic shift from an exploitative `cut it down, tear it down, put roads through it' mentality to one in which the shire seeks to maintain the environment and limit the population impact on its environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the inscription of the wet tropics area on the World Heritage List the threat of logging has been replaced by other threats, some of which Senator Reynolds mentioned this afternoon. Not the least of these threats comes from tourism. Very careful management of the area will be needed to ensure that increases in visitation and visitor impact do not have a deleterious impact on the integrity and wilderness beauty of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to point out that while we have often strongly supported the notion of ecotourism and the idea that areas should be protected because in the long run their value in purely economic terms as wilderness areas through tourism far exceeds their value for rapid and destructive exploitation, nonetheless if those values are to be maintained indefinitely one must have an eye on the total visitor impact. Clearly, there is a limit on the number of people one can put into an area and maintain the very values which cause people to be attracted to that area. So I would make a plea that in pushing the case for ecotourism in its advertising, in its attempts to attract visitors from overseas, the government should keep in mind that each of these areas is limited in its ability to absorb tourists and that tourist numbers need to be kept within the ability of the environment to maintain itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the Kuranda skyrail was raised by Senator Reynolds. As I pointed out, the federal minister has not called for an EIS on this skyrail proposal. We have serious reservations about the building of this skyrail because it does involve a commercial development in a national park. I stress that this is a national park in addition to being a World Heritage area. It may be that the total impact on the environment could be reduced by taking people in by skyrail rather than by the buses which now toil up a quite steep escarpment, causing pollution and damage. Somebody said to me just today that Kuranda has essentially become a car park in the midst of a rainforest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reducing the amount of road traffic going in there we may well in fact reduce the environmental impact. This needs to be very carefully assessed and so far that assessment has not been done. Moreover, from what I hear from local residents in Kuranda and the local conservation groups, there has been precious little discussion with the affected groups to find out exactly what their views are in relation to this skyrail. A properly conducted environmental impact statement process with public consultation would be a way of achieving that public involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that has cast a threat over the area is the proposed construction of the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme, something which I think Senator Ian Macdonald mentioned earlier. The state government has apparently shelved the idea for the time being in favour of demand side management, and that is precisely one of the major ways in which the state government should manage its electricity. As I think most honourable senators know, throughout Australia we have tended to build far too many power stations, and it would be possible through proper conservation management to achieve the end purposes of our energy use with the use of much less electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also gone into the Burdekin Dam extension. However, the Atherton and Mulgrave shire councils are planning to conduct a poll in the imminent local government elections in which they will put forward a yes case for the hydro-electric scheme. The Cairns Council has decided not to conduct such a poll. However, the Atherton and Mulgrave shire councils claim that 30 other local councils are willing to participate. The poll is nothing but a mischievous action by petty-minded officials who remain trenchantly and irrationally opposed to World Heritage listing. It should be condemned, or at least ignored. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow the federal minister to nominate two people to be appointed to the board of directors of the Wet Tropics Management Authority in accordance with the Queensland act. It will allow the minister to make arrangements for Australian public servants to work for the authority, and it requires an annual report from the authority on its administration, financial statements and the state of the wet tropic area. That report must be tabled in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropic area covers around 900,000 hectares of North Queensland. The management authority is a joint state-federal body set up to manage the wet tropics. The wet tropic area of North Queensland was nominated by the federal Labor government for World Heritage listing in December 1987. Senator Richardson was the then minister for the environment and he banned logging of rainforests in the area. At the same time, the then Prime Minister gave the people of the area an assurance that no person working in the timber industry would be disadvantaged. In April 1988, the Commonwealth government announced a three-year $75 million structural adjustment program, supposedly to assist people and businesses affected by the cessation of logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 when the government introduced its legislation on the wet tropics declaration under World Heritage, I was very concerned about the way the government handled the matter. Sadly, my concerns have been realised. Firstly, 2,000 to 3,000 jobs have been lost in the area, with no prospects of good employment for the people of these timber towns. Mr Hawke may remember his 5 June statement to the timberworkers that `no person working in the timber industry would be disadvantaged', but, as feared by the people at the time, they are very hollow words. At the moment, nearly six years later, the former timberworkers feel sold out, betrayed and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been left in the wake of the government's inaction to follow through with its assurance is former timber towns filled with great hurt, dislocation and suffering. So I say to Senator Coulter that there are always two sides to an environmental story. There have been some unfortunate consequences of the wet tropic declaration. Sadly, the listing has cost many people in self-sufficient hinterland towns such as Ravenshoe their livelihood and their dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson, when he was the relevant minister, went to the area and made all sorts of promises to the people and businesses which were going to be affected. Ravenshoe has now gone from a self-sufficient town to one with high unemployment. People's lives and businesses have been destroyed. Senator Richardson may have been able to have his career changes from environment minister to disgraced backbencher to resurrected health minister but, unfortunately, the timberworkers, businesses and people of Ravenshoe were deprived of their livelihoods and generations of activities in the timber industry. They did not have the same range of opportunities open to them as Senator Richardson had. To many, their only alternative was the dole. Sadly, what has followed has been marriage breakdowns, nervous breakdowns, health problems, opportunities gone forever and a loss of dignity and despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the smaller areas that have seen their social and economic fabric destroyed by the heritage listing. I refer to towns like Atherton where the large timber mill which dominated the centre of town remains as a decaying memento of the effect of the government's actions over the wet tropic declaration. Mareeba suffered the same fate. Atherton is a town that could not afford to lose the 200 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims have been made that tourism has increased into northern Queensland. Cairns may be showing the signs of increased activity and all the bustle of progress, but it is the rural communities which once supported the $33 million a year timber industry that have been dealt a death blow. They have gone from viable, economical, self-sufficient communities to dying towns. It has been a high price to pay when we consider the human cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has played a major role in this resulting misery and deprivation of dignity by not sticking to its promises, by letting down people, by being so bureaucratic and pedantic in denying workers and businesses their rightful compensation payments. There were workers who were promised $30,000, but they got only $2,500. Because of a technicality, they missed out on the eligible period of work in the guidelines by a matter of weeks. No number of pleas to minister Kelly could find any compassion in her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great disappointment in the area with the federal government's handling of the so-called support package. Some feel they were pawns in the government's political needs. Just watching the show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS> showed the Labor Party needed the greenies's vote to win the 1990 election. But the hardworking timber people of the north and the businesses they supported were the ones who had to pay the price for a Labor Party victory. I say to Senator Coulter that I take exception to the fact that he completely disregarded the needs of the working men and women in North Queensland when he said in his contribution that the environmentalists were the hard workers. I do not think that is fair or reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give more examples of the effect of jobs being removed from these local communities. Mr Hawke personally said there would be a loss of only 800 jobs. There always is, and there always has been, a multiplying effect. At least 2,500 jobs have been lost. No community can afford this. There certainly is not a lot of other work available locally. The only jobs available for some of these timberworkers are in far-flung mining areas. Families are separated, with fathers living in one area and mothers staying at home, and this being the only way they could ever get a job. The government could have done more for these people whose lives it entered into, disrupted and, in some cases, destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other job creation projects were promised, false claims were being made about tourism. I am very pleased to see the Far North booming and creating jobs and opportunities for all Australians. Tourism is being managed very well in the Far North&mdash;22 per cent of all tourists to Australia visit the Far North; Cairns is set to become the second largest cruise ship port; the airport has record numbers of arrivals and there is no doubt that the wet tropic areas form some of that attraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, once again, the communities badly affected by the government's decisions have not been the beneficiaries. There have been projects like the Kirrama tourist resort, the $75 million project at Ravenshoe that would have provided hundreds of jobs. That project just went away because the bureaucracy of the Wet Tropics Management Authority was too slow and too difficult. Projects will not wait around while the authority acts in a slow, cumbersome and bureaucratic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism that the bureaucracy is slow has come from no less a source than the Coordinator-General of the Queensland government. As disclosed in a FOI document obtained by the Wilderness Preservation Society, the Coordinator-General said to the Queensland Premier that there had been serious and unreasonable delays to development projects in the Cairns region by the Wet Tropics Management Authority. He further suggested a strategy to speed up the process. The Coordinator-General, in his advice to the Premier, said that projects had been severely hampered by the authority. These are the words of a senior public officer to the Premier of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Commonwealth government should also take heed of these words from the Queensland Coordinator-General that the authority for which they are jointly responsible is severely hampering projects in the wet tropics region. He specifically criticised as severely hampered projects the $28 million Kuranda skyrail which has just been approved after four years delay, and also the Kirrama resort at Ravenshoe that, in fact, will never go ahead because the investors became sick and tired of the bureaucratic delays of the authority. This was a great blow to Ravenshoe, which has borne the brunt of the government's decision on the wet tropics. This is a town where people have lost their jobs, their investments and values in their homes and businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation package for the loss of logging missed many other losses that continue to this day. There are no reasonable values on homes and businesses in the area which has been denuded of its economic purpose. The authority, with a stroke of its bureaucratic pen, is able to disallow an economic activity which totally devalues any resale of business. In these cases, there is no chance of compensation. There are possibilities in the area which could allow the badly affected areas, such as around Ravenshoe, to re-establish themselves based on tourism. But it will take time, cooperation and a bit of sense from the Wet Tropics Management Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Kirrama resort project would have guaranteed 100 to 150 permanent jobs. It was a $75 million project which would have returned $11 million each year to the area. But how did the management authority treat the project? Firstly, it would not look at it for over two years. Ninety-five per cent of the road system was already there. It would have used roads that were on the divide of the watershed and would have caused little erosion. It would have opened up five different ecosystems for the public to learn about and admire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old timber tracks were there and they could have been opened up as walking tracks with a minimum of damage. It would also have met the requirements of world heritage listing, which is to create access for public appreciation, and that must include all people&mdash;not just the super-fit backpackers, but the ordinary bushwalker, the disabled and not so mobile people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government, through the Premiers Department, was providing all the help it could give, but the authority insisted on the alternative route that required crossing a major river, with infrastructure cost to the shire of $7 million. The original route made the area accessible to Ravenshoe and was environmentally non-threatening, using roads that had been in existence since the turn of the century. Needless to say, because of the idealism and years of delay by the authority, the project investors had to pull out and the opportunities for ecotourism and a promised future for Ravenshoe were lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with the Tully Millstream where, because of delays by the authority, the benefits to the Ravenshoe area of drought storage and consequential flood mitigation for Ingham have also been lost. Now that we have the reality of a wet tropics management authority, we must have one that works. As pointed out by the Queensland government when the skyrail project was eventually approved, there is a commitment attached to the World Heritage listing to allow people to see and enjoy our natural wonders, so long as it does not cause damage to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projects must go ahead. The authority must manage in a sensible way. There should not be examples, as has happened, of millable logs that are cut for roadworks but that are not allowed to milled and have to be left there or burnt. Electricity authorities must be able to build their powerlines to supplement the power needs of Cairns, Mossman and Port Douglas. The electricity needs of Queensland call for the Tully Millstream to be constructed, contributing 600 megawatts to the electricity grid as well as allowing demand management of supply, which is not possible with the alternatives of coal or diesel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority must look into the real concerns of feral animals in the forests&mdash;particularly feral pigs and cats which are growing in numbers. We have to have disease control programs. Money must be spent on real schemes, not mickey mouse tree-planting schemes for residents. Government funded businesses should not be allowed to set up unfairly against private businesses. Fire control must be addressed as a result of the loss of forestry roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the area was managed by the forestry department on a staged basis. It is now a very large area to manage. Money must not be wasted. Tree species planting must be planned with a view to creating a viable future industry, not just short-term rehabilitation. The many projects which have shrivelled up and died because of the excessive bureaucracy of the management authority must be considered in a reasonable amount of time so that these affected regions can remake their futures based on tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing the bill, but I call on the government to ensure that the management authority works for the best interests of the area and its long-term economic future. After all, this is the very least that the government can do as part of its responsibility to the forgotten people of the timber towns who have been left without jobs and opportunities as a result of the government's shabby treatment and its breach of assurances given at the time of the world heritage listing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the views of the green or environmentalist lobby expressed by Senator Coulter. My contribution has been made to draw attention to the downside of what has happened to those towns. I can tell Senator Coulter and Senator Chamarette that many people have suffered. They have lost their homes, but worst of all they have lost their self-respect. For three or four generations these people were millworkers, they were timber-getters, and they were proud of their chosen profession. They have now been reduced to painting toilets or collecting the dole. They cannot leave their houses and move away because their houses really have no value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the things that I want to point out to the people who represent the other side of the debate. There is a very significant downside to the world heritage area. I understand the tourism potential, but that potential was already there and it was working. Those forests have been logged for 80 or 90 years and their conservation appeal was still there after all that time. I put that on the record as  the other side of the debate and to show what problems are caused when these areas are declared world heritage areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been stated, the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Conservation Bill 1993 gives effect to the agreement reached three years ago between the Queensland and federal governments over the management of the wet tropics of Queensland World Heritage area. The bill's stated aim is to facilitate the protection, conservation, presentation and transmission of the area to the future generations. Because the bill merely gives legislative support to the agreement, it says very little about the importance of the area being declared World Heritage. It also says nothing about the need for Aboriginal people being involved in the management of the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter has already spoken eloquently about the unique environmental qualities of this particular wet tropics World Heritage area, and I will not go into further detail. I feel he has done it justice. I merely want to support everything that he has said. I would also like to underline the question that Senator Coulter raised regarding why the minister for the environment is not requiring an environmental impact assessment for 7.5 kilometres of cableway and for the shops, toilets, kiosk, and an 80-person cafeteria in the middle of the wet tropics world heritage area. I believe this is a question that deserves to be answered by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 March 1990, when the wet tropics World Heritage area agreement was signed by the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, it was required as a high priority that there be the development of a management plan. After four years, there is none available&mdash;not even a draft. The Greens also want to emphasise the necessity that at least a draft management plan should be made available for public input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also pointed out the failure of the federal government and the minister for the environment to intervene and protect the valuable high conservation forests of our country, and he was referring to old-growth forests and rainforest areas. I support that concern. We have a problem of national disaster proportions on our hands in Australia in relation to the destruction of old-growth forests. This question must be increasingly raised to challenge the behaviour of the federal government for failing to implement what was, at base, a fairly inadequate national forest policy statement which included a moratorium clause that allowed a moratorium on logging of high conservation value forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I want to reply to some of the comments made by Senator Boswell regarding the disadvantage and the destructive impact of environmental protection on timberworkers. At this point I do not wish to oppose any of his statements regarding the negative social and employment impacts on people. I believe it is very important that we consider those negative impacts and that we assist the people who are experiencing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, continued logging in old growth forests and rainforest areas disadvantages timber workers. It is not the bans that disadvantage them; it is the fact that logging of old-growth forests occurs at all. It leaves the whole industry unsustainable because it utilises technology and mechanical processes that destroy old-growth forests for woodchipping purposes. This practice gradually diminishes employment opportunities and eventually destroys the industry's base. We need a restructuring of the forest industry before we can satisfactorily address the concerns that Senator Boswell has raised. It is not simply a matter of putting an end to environmental concerns or carrying out environmental assessments; it is a matter of ensuring that environmental impact is considered together with the future impact on people employed in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell commented on the perceived disadvantages of world heritage listing. The January 1994 edition of the newsletter <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wet Tropics Update</EMPHASIS> presented the results of a survey of attitudes towards world heritage areas, and the results are interesting. The survey found that regional support for the listing of wet tropics as a world heritage area has increased from 73 per cent to 80 per cent, and that the incidence of strong support is up from 51 per cent to 59 per cent. Capital city support was relatively steady, up 2 per cent to 72 per cent. Awareness of wet tropics world heritage areas had also increased&mdash;in cities, from 31 per cent to 43 per cent, and in regional areas, from 71 per cent to 87 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is an increasing regional awareness of the importance of the wet tropics world heritage area. According to the survey, 57 per cent of North Queenslanders say that the world heritage area is having a positive effect on local communities. Only 16 per cent were reported as perceiving a negative effect. That demonstrates a significant increase in satisfaction with the information provided as well as progress in decision making. More and more people are realising the major benefits of tourism and environmental protection. General support and other positive indicators are highest in Cairns and Townsville, and lower on the tableland and communities south of Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing understanding of the aims of world heritage listing. They are being perceived as being positive measures, designed to protect people living and working in the regions affected, as well as to protect the resources of our wet tropics at world heritage level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, CAFNEC, has expressed concerns about the management of the wet tropics area by the Wet Tropics Management Authority. I would like to cite some of those concerns because this proposed legislation has failed to take them into account. Some of the problems listed by CAFNEC are: that the decision making is not transparent and that the board takes a behind-closed-doors approach; that management does not adequately take into account regional issues and considerations; that the communities in the region do not feel that they are able to participate; and that the role of the Wet Tropics Management Authority is neither clear nor well understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also suggested that the authority does not adequately represent or understand the local community and that the present system does not allow politicians to adequately gauge community feeling on issues because there is no forum that allows opposing parties to come together. I suggest that the concerns raised by Senator Boswell are a good example of this. Dialogue that looks at the regional impact of environmental protection is essential if we are to work together in a way beneficial to the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another comment was that there is too much political interference in the job that the Wet Tropics Management Authority should be doing, and mention was made of the proposed skyrail project. I have already mentioned my concerns regarding that issue but, as Senator Coulter suggested, it will require direct action and intervention to determine whether the project will minimise or exacerbate the impact on this sensitive area. Finally, CAFNEC suggested two changes to this legislation so that, firstly, Ministerial Council meetings would be open to the public and include the chance for the community to arrange representation; and secondly, membership of the Wet Tropics Management Board would be expanded to seven and include non-government representatives resident in Far North Queensland, with at least one coming from the Atherton Tableland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend moving two amendments to this bill to address two distinct problems. The first relates to my concern that the bill at present has no context in which to operate. I foreshadow moving an amendment which would incorporate a preamble to identify the reasons for the bill's introduction and make clear that Aboriginal people have a strong claim for involvement in the management of the wet tropics in Queensland. I understand that the Democrats are moving a similar amendment. At the appropriate time I will suggest that my amendment be moved first because their amendment is similar to mine in part. Secondly, I foreshadow moving a technical amendment which would allow the bill to take into account any changes to the agreement that may occur from time to time consequent to review of the operation of the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the amendments moved by the Democrats that would allow Aboriginal people involvement in the management of the wet tropics, and the amendment moved by Senator Coulter, which reflects his concern about commercial infrastructure development impacting adversely on world heritage values. In closing, I stress the importance of the sort of constructive federal involvement that allows regional and local communities to work together in the very important task of protecting world heritage areas. </PARA>

This matter was first raised in this place six years ago and I well remember the angst caused by the decision to list the wet tropics as a world heritage area.

It is nice to know that the opposition is not opposed to the wet tropics of north Queensland being listed as a world heritage area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the debate, Senator Ian Macdonald asked some questions about funding, and he pointed to what he saw as a discrepancy of $1 million. As I understand it, $8.5 million was available to the authority to spend but it spent only $7.5 million of that amount. That was largely due to the fact that acquisition programs often take longer than anticipated because of delays with negotiations. The $1 million unspent was rolled over and is still available to the authority to spend. There is, therefore, no discrepancy. The money has not disappeared but will be spent by the authority at a date later than originally anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also indicate that there has been a change in the government's position since the earlier indication by Senator Robert Ray. As a result of some discussions between the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, the government will not now support the Democrats' proposed clause 5A(2). Proposed clause 5A(1) requires the Commonwealth to include among its nominees one or more Aboriginal representatives. That will be accepted, so the Commonwealth will move to accept that responsibility. However, proposed clause 5A(2) requires the Commonwealth to, in effect, pressure the Queensland government into including an Aboriginal representative on the authority. </PARA>

That having been said, we will not support the Greens' amendment on the preamble. As I understand it, the Democrats have a preamble amendment in any event and we think that is sufficient to cover the matters of interest raised by Senator Chamarette.

In fact, they enhance the area by giving people the opportunity of looking at it much closer and opening it up for Australians to see such a natural wonder. </PARA>

We have not had the opportunity of considering whether the substantial amendments in the committee of the whole warrant support. They might but they will not get our support as of this moment because we have not had the opportunity to look at them. The relevant shadow ministers, Mr Nugent and Mrs Gallus, have not looked at those particular matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Richardson and Senator Crowley are in the chamber because there is a continuing debate in the community about the treatment of two former housekeepers at the Lodge who were retrenched without notice early in October last year. Senator Crowley regularly lectures this chamber on the need to advance the interests of women, which we on this side fully support, and ensure that the power and privilege of government are used in a positive not a negative way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the two housekeepers at the Lodge is also a matter of widespread community concern. How should the employees of the Prime Minister of this country be treated? Mr and Mrs Keating are entitled to employ whom they wish at the Lodge. What we can insist on is that employees be treated fairly and decently and that their employers do not act in a harsh or capricious manner. At the same time that these housekeepers were retrenched&mdash;without notice, I stress&mdash;the government was passing through the parliament the so-called Industrial Relations Reform Bill which imposes new obligations on private sector employers. Had Mr Keating been a private sector employer he would not only have been subject to normal common law procedures, but also, under his own act, he would have been subject to new claims for breaches of statutory duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recording just what happened to these two women. On the night of Sunday, 3 October, they received a phone call at home from an officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet telling them not to report for duty the following day. Further, these two women were warned that if they tried to attend work the following day and attempted to enter the Lodge they would be turned away by the guards at the gate. They were directed to report to the department on the following Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the department they were apparently given no reasons for their dismissal. They were not even given certificates of service. They were cautioned about the secrecy provisions contained in the Crimes Act and Public Service regulations. Imagine how anyone would feel about this treatment. Imagine how you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would feel. Senator Crowley should imagine how she would feel about being treated in this manner. One of the housekeepers had served two Prime Ministers. The other had been at the Lodge for 12 months and had been made permanent about six months previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sackings were done without any warning. I understand that some days previously the Prime Minister had expressed to one of the housekeepers his satisfaction about the performance of their duties. He had flagged to them that there would be some changes at the Lodge, but that the two housekeepers were assured of employment. Then came the infamous Sunday night telephone call. In my view, the two housekeepers were entitled to be confronted face to face by the relevant officer and given proper reasons why this seemingly harsh action was taken. This did not happen. Instead, there was just a voice on the telephone saying that they were not wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In subsequent days, after numerous requests to the department, they finally received certificates of service from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This was three weeks after they had been sacked. The certificates of service state that the two housekeepers provided competent housekeeping services and that their services had been terminated as a result of the staffing arrangements at the Lodge. I seek leave to table the certificates of service of the two housekeepers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to note that the certificate of service states that a certificate of service is not granted to a person if, firstly, a person has been dismissed from service for any offence or misconduct of a serious nature or, secondly, a person has been guilty of frequent acts of misconduct although of a light nature. That is written on the bottom of the certificate of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks later, after a response to a question that I asked at the estimates committee regarding staffing at the Lodge, it was revealed by Ms Tinney, a senior officer in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, that three staff members had been retrenched, including the two housekeepers. In contradiction of the certificates of service which I have cited, it was stated before the estimates committee that the housekeepers failed to carry out directions in relation to the use of their Mastercards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Tinney said that they were going out and buying things without advising the department. It was alleged that they were apparently not working well together. Finally, it was suggested that they were changing rosters and not completing work that was done on particular rosters. At that time Ms Tinney admitted the housekeepers were not given any warning about their conduct, although she apparently said that changes would have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The housekeepers have unreservedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing against them. They have sought an explanation as to the reasons for their termination of employment. Senator Gareth Evans compounded the attack on the housekeepers by raising further accusations against them in the Senate; namely, that there were at least four meetings with the staff in which the staff had been asked to improve their working relationships with one another. He also repeated the department's concerns about the credit cards which, it was said, had been drawn to their attention a number of times. These allegations are denied by the housekeepers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to sort out these problems, the coalition attempted to reconvene Estimates Committee A at the end of the last session. Regrettably, this was not supported by the Australian Democrats. The dilemma has always been: how can the housekeepers have the circumstances of their termination of employment dealt with independently when faced with serious allegations by the department? As a result of those allegations they have been out of work. I understand that they are still out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless this parliament is prepared to inquire into the matter there are, I understand, no avenues to determine their rights and arrive at a fair and just outcome. The Members of Parliament Act precludes any court action. The statements made by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were made under parliamentary privilege and prevent any actions for defamation. The one avenue which seems to offer some hope is for the ombudsman to independently investigate the matter and determine the circumstances of the termination of the housekeepers' employment and the basis for the allegations made by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from media reports that the ombudsman has agreed to investigate certain matters, but there seems to be some query as to whether the ombudsman has jurisdiction. It is some three weeks after the initial complaints were made to the ombudsman and it is still not clear whether she considers herself to have jurisdiction in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I do not want to go into the technical legal arguments. The office of the ombudsman was set up to help protect the private citizen against the oppressive conduct of government. It was also an essential aspect of the ombudsman that this was an avenue of investigation when no other legal remedies were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter needs to be quickly resolved. I would have thought that all Labor members of parliament believe individual workers are entitled to a fair go. As the saying goes, they are entitled to their day in court. Serious allegations have been made by their employer that have caused them financial loss and personal distress. This is an issue of widespread community concern, as evidenced by the media interest. This issue will not go away until justice prevails and these allegations and counter claims can be independently investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that Senator Crowley is in the chamber because she advises the Prime Minister on women's affairs. Although she and I differ on quite a number of issues I hope that with her concern for women and her concern to see justice done she would be prepared to take this matter up and see what can be done to assist these women, to at least give them a chance to have their say and the chance to have the rights and the wrongs of the issue independently determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these matters are not resolved properly and fairly by the ombudsman I ask Senator Woodley, who is in the chamber, to strongly support any motion in his party room so that this parliament could set up an inquiry, whether it be through the estimates process or some other mechanism, to see whether we can assist these two housekeepers to obtain justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to an old gentleman who died recently aged 102 years. In 1957, I served in the navy during the national service conscription. I visited the Lyceum Theatre in Pitt Street in Sydney on a number of occasions, not to see any movies but because it was the centre for the Central Methodist Mission. The occupier of the superintendency of the mission at that time was a great man, Reverend Dr Frank Rayward. He died in December, aged 102.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute tonight to his life and to offer some reflections on the influence&mdash;although it was so long ago&mdash;that he had on my life and on the fact that I am here tonight. I want to quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> written by James Murray&mdash;one of his best that I have read. I do not always agree with James Murray but he certainly has touched the very essence of this man's life. He said that Frank Rayward attributed his long life to choosing the right parents and the right spouse. But in his childhood he was almost despaired of. He grew up on a farm near Lismore where his two brothers outstripped him in strength and certainly in stature because Frank Rayward was only a small man in stature but not in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said of himself in later years, `I was a miserable specimen'. Looking back not so long ago on his long life he declared, `There are some people who regard me as somewhere between a fossil and a freak. I regard myself as an extinct volcano'. Volcano he certainly became after his early years as a local preacher, along with his father and brothers on the Lismore Methodist circuit. He became one of the great preachers of his day. I am very grateful to James Murray for his excellent research into this man's life. I add my own reflections to that research. He describes Frank Rayward in this way in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fire in his soul brought him eventually to Sydney in 1938 where, as superintendent of the Central Methodist Mission he held a thousand-strong congregation spellbound every Sunday night for the next 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Even if it was before the inroads of television certainly it was no mean achievement. Frank Rayward was not just all talk. He was certainly more than a preacher. He got things done. He was interested in the needs and the wants of people. Their sores and wounds touched him and he set up the first pensioner foot clinic in Australia. Only the old know what the feet can do to a life. Rayward recognised this ministry as practical and intimate as was the ministry of Christ in washing the disciples feet in the upper room. He developed a concept of total care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, the Lottie Stewart Hospital rose at his insistence, Waddall House&mdash;now Wesley Hospital&mdash;and the Sylvania Settlement for aged couples followed. Today these are tributes to the work of Frank Rayward. He was very much in the Wesleyan or Methodist tradition of combining evangelical preaching with a commitment to social justice and progressive reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These emphases have always been part of the Central Methodist, now Wesley missions around Australia. The tribute is evident in such concrete examples as the relief work which continues; the establishment of Lifeline, which was first established at the Central Mission in Sydney; and in the extensive aged care centres, which were formed and still continue.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank Rayward also had an emphasis on family. James Murray comments that Elsie, his wife for 68 years, was a true helpmeet. James Murray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When asked once what was the most memorable day in his life, he rejected afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace</PARA>
<PARA>which he had enjoyed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and many other honours. "The proudest time was when I saw Elsie walking down the aisle towards me. She was lovely."</PARA>
<PARA>He did have other prides and other achievements. He prepared more than 50 men&mdash;it was only men in those days&mdash;for the Methodist ministry. He established radio lectures when religious broadcasting was still in its infancy. He did not have a narrow view of denominationalism for he was among those ecumenical clergy and lay people who helped establish the Australian Council of Churches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly was as a preacher that he was pre-eminent. I must confess that I do not remember many sermons, even my own, but I do remember a sermon that he preached over 30 years ago, so it must have had an impact on me. It was a sermon whose title was the `Cross and the Crown'. He spoke about the fact that the crown and government only exist truly in their proper role under God. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he went on to say that the cross is the model of servanthood and that, as parliamentarians come to this place, we should never forget that we come as servants. The very title minister, which often is seen as being something to achieve, means servant. The Prime Minister is the first servant of all the servants of the people and of God. Rayward was certainly a servant and a tool in the hands of the master. I conclude with the words of James Murray from his article. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the tool was well honed by the apostolic apprentice, and even at his 102nd birthday last September, after a joyful breakfast with the others in the nursing home named in his honour, he spoke for 20 minutes with the most wonderful eloquence about the Master Carpenter who hailed from Nazareth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)&amp;(2) The possibility of an association between pertussis vaccine and encephalopathy was first reported in 1933 with a further report in 1947. The latter report was contested in the medical literature but led to the inclusion of neurological disease as a contra indication to vaccination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further reports which appeared in subsequent years were not conclusive and revealed no recognisable pattern of neurological damage that could be attributed to the vaccine, nor was there experimental evidence in humans or animals that either proved or disproved a causal relationship between pertussis vaccine and brain damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently a U.S. Institute of Medicine Committee report quoted in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that there was insufficient evidence to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between pertussis vaccine and chronic neurological damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard encyclopaedia of adverse reactions and drug interactions, Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs (1992) concludes that "there is insufficient evidence to indicate a causal relationship between pertussis vaccine and chronic neurological disease".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) established panels of experts to investigate the question of safety of pertussis vaccine and a substantial report was made in 1974. These studies were both retrospective and prospective and again produced no conclusive evidence for the link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been two major court cases dealing with the issue. The first was run in the U.K. High Court in 1987. An exhaustive re-examination of written and oral submissions from recognised authorities from the U.K, the U.S. and Europe as well as literature and case reports was undertaken over a protracted period. Lord Justice Stuart Smith concluded that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy him that, on balance of probability, pertussis vaccine can cause damage in young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a second case the Irish High Court and Irish Supreme Court studied the evidence in relation to a particular plaintiff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Product leaflets from the introduction of the Triple Antigen in 1953 contain a statement regarding the possibility of encephalopathy following pertussis immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Adjuvants produce higher immunity with lower doses of antigen. The usual adjuvant used for vaccines is an aluminium mineral carrier. This has been included at times in the pertussis vaccine since as early as 1956.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early studies on pertussis vaccine showed that the larger the dose the more likely the child is to get an immune response. In 1941 the dosage recommended by some experts was a minimum of 80,000 million organisms given in increasing increments over a period of a few weeks. In the early 1950s an international standard for the vaccine was determined based on 20,000 million organisms.</PARA>
