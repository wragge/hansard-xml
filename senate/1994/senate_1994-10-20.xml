<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. The report deals with our duties under section 206 of the Native Title Act, the first of which is to consult extensively with the community about the implementation of native title. The committee completed its first round of public consultations during August. This report is very much a record of those consultations and the evidence we received. I am pleased to say that the report is unanimous and it provides a snapshot of the developments and issues that have emerged concerning native title since the passage of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that we have not sought to fully assess the act because it is very much early days in the development of native title in this country. The committee took the opportunity to consult widely and travel around Australia to talk to people about native title, the act and related issues. Our intention was to consult rather than try to form definitive views on how the act was operating&mdash;and the report reflects that. For some people the report might be less controversial than they had hoped; but, as I say, it was a unanimous report of the committee and really just a reflection of those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why it is too early to make definitive judgments about the act. The first of those is that there have been surprisingly few claims lodged at this stage&mdash;certainly when the committee was taking evidence in August. Therefore, there has been very little progress in processing those claims. It is also worth noting that industry in general has shown a reluctance to make claims using the non-claimant application route provided in the legislation. So until they start to use that device more freely, developments in that area will be slow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are another couple of points worth mentioning in terms of why developments have not proceeded as quickly as some might have thought. There is a general wait and see approach to a number of test cases that are proceeding&mdash;particularly the Wik claim in Queensland, and a range of other cases. These cases will further develop the common law concept of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues is the long preparation time required for claims. A number of Aboriginal groups have expressed the view to the committee that they are working away at claims, but that the resources and time requirements of properly developing a claim are quite extensive. We expect to see more claims coming in over the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I would like to mention is that, despite the fact that a number of states have passed state legislation which sets up a sort of complementary regime to the Native Title Act, most of those have not yet been proclaimed; so the regimes under state legislation, provided for in the legislation, are not in place. That has also acted to slow developments compared with what might otherwise have been expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major issue is the fact that the Western Australian government is challenging the legislation in the High Court. That challenge will no doubt resolve a range of outstanding issues. Clearly, there is an impact on the community generally that leads people to wait to assess that High Court decision. That is also impacting on state governments. All those things are important in assessing the development of the progress under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, where there are two competing regimes&mdash;the regime under the native title legislation and the regime under the Western Australian Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act&mdash;people are quite confused and unable to proceed with confidence. Until those issues are resolved, we will need to wait for that determination before we see a greater number of claims and progress with those claims, in Western Australia in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of this experience a number of the views expressed to the committee reflected the positions people had expressed and adopted prior to the legislation being enacted. As I say, they have not had a great deal of practical experience of the act being in operation, and very much a `wait and see' approach has been adopted by a range of key groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention briefly a couple of matters that arise from the report. The first is that the President of the National Native Title Tribunal, Justice French, has set up liaison committees of industry and Aboriginal groups in each state. That has been a very good initiative in that it has allowed him to work through with those groups a range of issues and problems that were raised with the committee. We have found that a number of those issues have been resolved, at least partly, since our consultations, as he has worked with those industry and Aboriginal groups to refine processes and resolve some of the teething problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I want to mention briefly is the need for resources for education about native title. By this, I am not suggesting a major PR campaign or television advertising campaign about native title, but there is a need for key groups, including Aboriginal groups, to be provided with more information and knowledge about native title. This includes groups which have not been directly involved to any great extent, such as local government, the tourism industry and other groups. There is a need for them to be provided with solid information and assistance in coming to terms with native title issues. Aboriginal groups and industry groups may also require assistance both in coming to terms with native title and in dealing with the implications of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points I want to stress is that it is important that we provide resources to either the tribunal or some other group to make sure that communities which are affected by native title claims quickly get easily understandable information on the impact of those claims and the legal issues surrounding them. It is important that we have people on the ground who are able to talk to people about how native title claims may impact on them. That would help alleviate a lot of the fear and misunderstanding that could be associated with claims being lodged. It would be a very good pro-active move if we were to get out early into the community and provide that educative role. It will not resolve all the difficulties, but it will at least promote better understanding of the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the issue of land tenure history and maps for dealing with native title claims. It has been a fairly widespread experience for industry and Aboriginal groups that land tenure information and mapping has been inadequate and that the costs of that are prohibitive. The president of the tribunal has been playing a role in trying to resolve that issue, but clearly the native title issue is placing demands on state government land administration in relation to this issue. Those problems need to be resolved to facilitate the purposes of the act and the resolution of native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to place on record my thanks to the staff of the committee, who have worked very hard in coming to terms with this new native title concept and the demands of the committee I also thank the members of the native title committee, who, despite their quite different views on native title issues and the Native Title Act, worked very cooperatively. It has been a good learning experience for all of us who were involved in this initial round of consultations. Hopefully, the knowledge we have gained will be useful when we come to have a closer look at the provisions of the act in the coming years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To take the last point made by Senator Chris Evans, I thank the staff of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, who did a tremendous job in our recent consultative process. I commend them for their assistance in relation to the preparation of this report. I also commend the input of fellow members of the committee in relation to the first interim report. This report succinctly sets out some of the issues that we are facing. Senator Evans has touched on those issues, and I might raise one or two in my address to the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I think that Mr Justice French is doing a very good job. The setting up of these liaison committees can iron out a lot of the wrinkles, so to speak. One of the criticisms has been the low threshold in accepting claims: that is, that a prima facie case does not necessarily have to be made out. It has been said that one could lodge anything with the Native Title Tribunal and it would be accepted. That is unfair. There is some uncertainty, however, and Mr Justice French has been on record as saying that an applicant is not required to establish a prima facie case in order to have an application accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was given by the New South Wales land council that there has been a good deal of uncertainty in relation to exactly what is the position. The making out of a claim for native title is a very complex issue, and it places a great demand on the staff of the Native Title Tribunal in accepting evidence and determining what is proper evidence. As Senator Evans said, a demand has been made on the various state land administration departments. That matter will have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the non-claimant application has not provided the remedy that everyone thought it would. Certainly it has not been used by pastoralists or the mining sector, who have expressed concerns with the process. I recall that one witness highlighted the problem of having to go through the non-claimant process before anything else was done. That process held up any proposed activity or venture. The non-claimant process has some problems which need looking at. It has the potential to blow out and delay matters. It does not provide the quick result that some people said it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to cooperation from the states, it was a shame that we did not hear from Queensland or New South Wales. The submission made by the Western Australian government was most helpful and that sort of cooperation is essential if this committee is to fulfil its task as outlined in the terms of reference. The situation in the Northern Territory has to be closely looked at. Without burdening the committee with too much work, that situation could merit attention some time in the future. Also, the South Australian situation should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only so much that the committee can do. The committee covered a good deal of ground in going to Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Nevertheless, there is still a good deal of uncertainty in relation to the act. It is some 10 months since we debated this legislation and I think many of us are none the wiser as to how it will affect the community in the fullness of time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the finance minute in response to the committee's report No. 326 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>. It will be recalled that the committee tabled report No. 326 in November last year. The report contained 148 recommendations which were aimed at improving the administration of Australia's tax system. The committee's recommendations have been very favourably received by many individuals and organisations working in the tax profession. I am pleased to say that the government, too, has responded positively to the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear MP, released the government's response to the 60 recommendations of the committee on matters of policy. The finance minute I have just tabled is the second and final part of the government's response to the report. The finance minute addresses the 88 recommendations of the committee which deal with administrative matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the vast majority of the committee's recommendations have been accepted and are being implemented. Some of the most significant policy recommendations agreed to by the committee are to establish the tax law improvement project, the aim of which is to rewrite and simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; to establish a small taxation claims tribunal to provide a cheap and streamlined review process for taxpayers with claims below $5,000; to sponsor the development of a charter of taxpayers' rights to better define the relationship between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office; to create a taxation ombudsman with the Office of the  Commonwealth Ombudsman to provide a discrete and readily identifiable avenue of administrative review for taxpayers; and to publish rulings issued by the tax commissioner in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and to table them in parliament within five sitting days of publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative recommendations accepted by the government cover such matters as encouraging the further development of the Australian Taxation Office's computer systems, particularly to allow external access to some databases; providing explanatory information which is well targeted, accurate and up to date; improving the quality of training for staff involved in tax audits; and restructuring the ATO and reorganising particular groups within the office. The measures contained in the finance minute in conjunction with those announced by the Assistant Treasurer will go a long way to ensuring that ordinary taxpayers are treated fairly, are clearly informed of their rights and have access to appropriate forms of administrative review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is vitally important that the momentum for change which has been generated by the committee's inquiry and by the positive nature of the government's response is not lost. Therefore, over the next few months the committee intends to meet with the taxation commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, to discuss the implementation of those recommendations which have been accepted and also to meet with the director of the tax law improvement project, Mr Brian Nolan, to discuss progress in the simplification of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rewrite of the tax act is a very significant  undertaking, with potentially huge benefits for the Australian community. Although the early results from the improvement project are encouraging, I know that there are some in the tax profession who are concerned that the complexity of the tax laws will not be substantially reduced unless questions of tax policy are considered as they arise. The committee is inclined to agree that the best results will be achieved if the substantive provisions of the law are reviewed at the same time as the words are being redrafted. The work of the corporations law simplification program shows that such a task can be undertaken successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as the finance minute acknowledges, the committee's report has created a real opportunity for change. I am pleased that the government and the tax office have shown a willingness to grasp the opportunity. The committee is hopeful that the changes being made will be to the benefit of all taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to present to the Senate on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the committee's annual report of activities for 1993-94. This report, which is the 334th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year. The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports in parliament in 1976. Prior to that date, the committee regularly prepared indexes of committee reports for the information of parliament and, less frequently, tabled statements of committee activities and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms&mdash;and I quote from that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The period 1993-94 was a year in which the committee tabled five reports, published a discussion paper in relation to its inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments and gave its approval to a new set of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments. The most significant of the reports tabled was undoubtedly report 326, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>. The inquiry was a significant exercise which generated considerable attention within government circles and in the wider community. It is the committee's hope that its recommendations will lead to real improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia's tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other reports tabled by the committee in 1993-94 were: report 327, which contained the committee's comments on aspects of the finance minute in relation to the report of the Midford Paramount Inquiry; report 328, which was the committee's report of activities for 1992-93; report 329, which contained all the finance minutes presented in response to committee reports in the year 1993; and report 330, which presented the results of the committee's review of those reports of the Auditor-General which had been tabled in the period 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One notable development in the last financial year has been the committee's decision to give a renewed focus to its statutory responsibility to examine reports of the Auditor-General. The committee believes this responsibility to be one of its most important duties. The committee has developed new procedures to allow it to report regularly to parliament on its examination of audit reports. These procedures are described in chapter 4 of the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight in the committee's year has been the approval of the new annual report requirements for departments. The new requirements state that an annual report must be tabled by 31 October and call for a much sharper focus on past year program performance rather than on administrative details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over 60 years the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has watched over the expenditure of public money by successive Commonwealth governments. I believe that the committee's work over the last 12 months has continued the tradition of helping to keep the executive accountable to parliament. I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat for their work in assisting the committee during the year. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

We are told that spare parts for goods re-manufactured outside Australia bear no sales tax and yet those re-manufactured in Australia attract a 21 per cent sales tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I think there is agreement around the chamber that that is the best way to proceed. There is a very large number of amendments for us to deal with in the course of this committee debate&mdash;I lost count of them after 120&mdash;so we have sought to consolidate them in accordance with the practice that we adopted during the debate on the native title legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are grouped according to subject matter and will be dealt with together when that particular subject matter is first reached in the bill, even if it is not necessarily the most substantive treatment of the particular item. The point at which the particular subject matter first arises logically seems the best place to have the debate. To the extent that complementary or associated amendments are involved, it is the intention that they be dealt with at the same time, even though they may not be formally endorsed until the actual clause is later dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two exceptions to that principle in the running sheet which we will have to deal with when we find them, namely, where a particular amendment is foreshadowed, is referred to, but not intended to be debated at that point. The reference is to the matter being dealt with a little further down. By and large, the matter is dealt with where it first arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments have been circulated around the chamber so far as the Greens are concerned. There is a bundle of opposition amendments which I think is just about to be circulated but has not yet got into formal circulation around the chamber. Similarly, with the Democrats' amendments, I think there are one or two last minute fiddles going on there and they are about to be circulated around the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the first couple of items involve Green amendments, I think we can, as soon as the Greens arrive&mdash;and that is one of the reasons for this extended procedural preamble&mdash;begin the debate. </PARA>

<PARA>The Greens (WA) have proposed an amendment to the title because we feel that there are grave problems in presenting this bill without recognising the actual purpose for which at least the Prime Minister and the government say it is being set up. Instead of referring to it as the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, which puts it in line with many other ATSIC amendment bills, we should have its clear and proper title at the front. Our substitute is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Act to establish a Land Fund and an Indigenous Land Corporation to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA>We feel that is a much better way of describing this bill because, firstly, that is what the government claims the act is being established for. Secondly, we think that the omission of the word `dispossession' from the legislation as it has been drafted is one that should be redressed immediately in its title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may, I will speak to amendments Nos 1 and 2 because they are related as No 2 is a consequential amendment. The Greens support, in principle, the setting up of this land fund. We believe that it is an appropriate time in history to set up a land fund aimed at redressing the injustices of the last 200 years. We think it is a very important and historic principle to establish. If that fund were really offering Aboriginal people $1 billion with which they could acquire and manage land, then it would assume great importance, because the ATSIC budget itself is only $1 billion every year. If the fund made $1 billion available to Aboriginal people, equal to the current ATSIC budget, then we feel that the act should also be cited as the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Act and should refer to section 1 of the principal act by omitting the word `Commission' and substituting `Commission and Indigenous Land Corporation'&mdash;that is, measuring the significance of the act that we are currently debating by including it on an equal footing with the principal act into which it is being inserted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to amendment No. 2, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Chamarette in relation to the change of name of the amending act. I think it makes sense. It tells the reader quite succinctly what it is all about. But with respect to amendment No. 1, I do not think that the coalition can go as far as to agree with that. The points that that covers can be dealt with when the coalition comes to its first amendment. I think amendment No. 2 is sensible and explains the matter much more clearly than the current title.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is prepared to accept both amendments Nos 1 and 2. Amendment No. 2, changing the short title of this act to make it more accurately reflect its actual subject matter, is perfectly acceptable. As to the long title, I think it needs to be clarified as to what Senator Chamarette's amendment actually does. I think there might have been some ambiguity in the way in which she explained the purpose of it. The amendment to the long title would interpolate the clause that is set out in her amendments, so the thing as a whole would read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Act to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 and certain other acts so as to establish a land fund and an indigenous land corporation to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders and for related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it will read in its extended long title form. The government regards it as perfectly sensible for the long title of the act to be genuinely descriptive of the contents of the legislation, rather than just hinting at them in purely formal terms, the way it does at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further point to be made, which I am happy to make for the record. The language is to establish a land fund et cetera to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is worth acknowledging that nothing we can do now by way of legislation or by way of payment of other forms of compensation could completely redress the dispossession. It is very difficult after 200  years of dispossession, marginalisation and maltreatment of Aboriginal people to talk in terms of complete redress ever being able to be satisfactorily achieved. At most, we can make some important steps in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Act itself is one such step; this is another major step in that direction. The further elements of the social justice package, when they come along, will go further again in that area. Over time, there may be still further ways in which we can address the subject of dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are claiming no more than that this bill is helpful in that respect. I hope that clarifies some of the concerns that Senator Chamarette was expressing to me yesterday with great vigour about the government's attitude to the general thrust and shape of this legislation. With the exception, unfortunately, of the opposition, we are in passionate agreement about the terms of the long title and we can perhaps now get on to more substantive issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for the haste with which I dealt with amendment No.3 when speaking to my other amendments. I think amendment No.3 does follow, in a logical sequence, amendments Nos 1 and 2. Having changed the name of the act so that it more effectively describes the purpose for which it has been set up, the Greens are presenting amendment No.3 to the committee because they believe it will do more justice to the name of the principal act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not think it would be appropriate to amend the principal act title in the way that Senator Chamarette has suggested. The proposal to include a reference to the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;but only the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;as an additional reference in the title of the principal act will be inadequate and misleading because the principal act, the ATSIC Act, establishes not only ATSIC itself and this new body, as will be the case after this legislation is hopefully passed, but a number of other corporations as well&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and a large number of regional councils. They are all established by the principal act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impracticable to mention in the short title to the principal act all the bodies that it establishes; and to single out one such additional body as a basis for amending the short title, whatever the significance of that body might be, we think lacks compelling logical foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the minister for clarification. Is the government stating by its unwillingness to support this that the Indigenous Land Corporation is just one of many other corporations? We are making the point that quite a large bureaucracy is being established. We have a new structure which has $3 million allocated to it each year. While we do not agree that the government should in any way be regarding it as a billion dollar fund&mdash;that is not the amount of money that actually goes to Aboriginal people for land acquisition and management&mdash;we still see that the government has established a billion dollar fund for itself that will be held by the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that if the government is establishing something that has an equivalent budget to that of the current ATSIC structure, it should at least justify that balance. So I would like clarification from the minister. Does he see it as more comparable with the other aspects of ATSIC functioning, or as an important new structure that is being developed to achieve the purposes that the government has stated?. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Manifestly an important new structure is being established to advance some very significant and important purposes, but that does not necessarily translate into a desirability to make the short title longer, and in particular selectively longer. It is a standard principle of drafting and publication that short titles should be short. Unless there is some really compelling reason for making them longer, we would prefer to avoid that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not in any way to be taken as a downgrading of the significance of the Indigenous Land Council. We would be the last people in the country who would want to do that. It is just a matter of believing that it is inappropriate to expand the short title in that way. This is not a super significant issue, but I think our respective positions have been clearly placed on the record. We are not trying to put the council down. It is just a matter of drafting style and parliamentary practice to treat it this way, and I hope everyone will accept it in that spirit. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the opposition's amendments Nos 9, 17 and 30 and deal with the principle of the separation of land granted by the land fund from native title land. The committee will note that the amendments state that the Indigenous Land Corporation, in the performance of its functions, must not hold or acquire, or enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to hold or acquire, an interest in land where the land is subject to native title or native title rights. This is a very important aspect because it separates the two pieces of legislation&mdash;the land fund legislation and the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will note that in the preamble it was said that the land fund was set up for those people who could not make a claim under the Native Title Act. The government recognised that there would be indigenous people who had a continuing association with the land and who could readily make out a claim. As I recall, the minister said something of the order of five per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be able to make that sort of claim. That left a vast majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who could not make a claim but who had still been dispossessed. That is, after all, what this land fund is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we muddy the waters and marry the two, there will be confusion. What is more, we could well find competing claims within the Aboriginal community. Where land has been granted to a group of fringe dwellers&mdash;perhaps living on the outskirts of a country town&mdash;those people may find that they are subject to a native title claim by another group which has a continuing association with the surrounding land. We could find that we have a group of Aboriginal people claiming native title over land held by another group of Aboriginal people. That is a distinct possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will note that the opposition's amendment No. 17 deals with section 191N(2). That sets out the need to give priority in the purchase of land to land which Aboriginal people cannot lay native title claim to. In (e) there is a need to ensure that the land which is the subject of a claim under native title is not acquired. In (f) there is the need to give the upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral properties priority over the acquisition of land in areas where there are already substantial land holdings by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, we might find an area in the north-west of Australia where Aboriginal people have a vast tract of land. Perhaps acquisition is not then the most pressing need. What might need to be looked at is the question of improving that land, because the land is already in their possession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 30 continues the theme I have mentioned and deals with section 47 of the Native Title Act. That says that section 47 of the Native Title Act does not apply to land acquired under subsection (1). It is saying that land cannot be granted under this legislation to a body of Aboriginal people or a corporation who can use the provisions of section 47 of the Native Title Act to fast-track a native title claim, that is, to convert it from land which was granted to them by the Indigenous Land Corporation to native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems I have highlighted previously is that we might have a community that has been granted land and the elders of the community would like to establish native title. If a pastoral lease is granted to them, they can use these fast-track provisions of section 47 of the Native Title Act to convert to native title. Other members of the community might not want that, and that could well create some sort of division within the community. Senator Campbell and I have stressed this on a number of occasions in the hearing in relation to this legislation, and also in previous debates on native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of converting land granted under this legislation to native title is a vexed one indeed. We can avoid this confusion and any possible division in the Aboriginal community by keeping the two schemes apart, so to speak. I understand that the Greens have reservations about this and I take on board the reasons they have expressed. Nonetheless, I believe it is sensible to keep the two schemes apart and not to risk confusion by overlapping. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make clear that these amendments are not acceptable to the government. This is an old chestnut. It is an issue that has been debated very extensively in the context of the native title debate and also during the committee hearings on this legislation. The positions have been made reasonably clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say at the outset that, as a practical matter, there is no doubt that the corporation will give precedence and priority to purchase and acquisition of land that is not likely to be capable of sustaining a native title claim. The whole point of this legislation is to try as far as possible to redress the balance for those who have been dispossessed. Almost by definition, the primary focus of the legislation is aimed at those who are unable to re-establish their connection with land by means other than through this sort of acquisition program. That is clear. That said, it needs to be appreciated that to try to draw an absolute formal line of division between the operation of the Native Title Act and this legislation is fraught with difficulty, complexity and also some problems of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first set of problems goes to the fact that there are some kinds of native title claims which simply do not amount to ownership in the same sense that will be possible for land acquired and granted under the scheme of this bill we are now considering. Some forms of native title claims extend only to rights of access&mdash;hunting rights and so on. To deny those people the capacity to have land granted to them, in effect, as owned land under the scheme of this legislation, simply because they have or possibly have a claim to native title rights in that very limited sense, would be seen as a travesty and a most unfair limitation on their capacity to acquire, in effect, full ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, we may have over a significant or large tract of land a possibly successful native title claim applicable as to only a very small proportion of it. The piece of land is an integrated whole, but if we try to draw an absolute wedge between the two pieces of legislation we would have again the unfortunate consequence of the availability of that native title claim over a very small part of the land&mdash;in effect, denying the capacity for acquisition of the whole. Again, I do not think that would be seen as fair or just. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further consideration goes to the practicability of administering a division of the kind that is proposed by the opposition. It would create a nightmare situation for the corporation, constrained and restricted in this way, to have to satisfy itself, in effect, that there is no viable native title claim likely to be available before it proceeds with some other form of transaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition suggests in amendment No. 9 that the corporation could avail itself of the non-claimant application procedure of going to the tribunal and getting the matter heard, determined and the doubts resolved in that way. But that is an extraordinarily cumbrous process. Given the flexibility and the speed with which we would like the corporation to be able to act and discharge its statutory functions, we regard this as an unnecessary and unhelpful constraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the practicalities of this, which is where I began. The pressures on the corporation to use its funds for acquiring land which would not otherwise come within the Native Title Act will be immense, because right around the country Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed, who have lost any connection with their land but who still have a hunger for it and want to re-establish that cultural, social and economic base for themselves, will be tremendously keen to be able to take advantage of this new legislation. The corporation will be tremendously keen to try to satisfy some of that hunger by those people. So as a practical matter all the pressures will be in the direction that the opposition and the government would want them to be&mdash;that is, a non-overlap. Nonetheless, it can be envisaged that overlap situations will arise. It is just an unnecessary restriction both in principle and in practice on the kind of flexibility and effectiveness we would like the corporation to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is not to be taken as any dog-in-the-manger, pig-headed, digging-in-at-all-costs response to an opposition viewpoint. We understand very well what the opposition is saying here, and the desirability. We just think that to try to formalise it in the way that the opposition has done creates many more problems than it will solve. </PARA>

We understand the rationale, which is simply to ensure that those people who will be given priority by this fund will be those who are dispossessed. But at this stage in Australia's history I think it can scarcely be stated that those who may possibly be able to exert a native title claim but have not yet been able to do so should be eliminated from the operations of this fund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond briefly to some of the comments made by Senator Gareth Evans and the other senators who have contributed to this discussion. Clearly, this is drawing a very clear distinction between the objects of the ILC and the objects of the Native Title Act. The preamble to the Native Title Act was quite explicit. It said, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that preamble was quite specific about why the land fund was established. I think the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration really teased out the point that one of the reasons why this land fund was being taken out of the Native Title Act was to get it away from the umbrella of that part of the preamble, because it was quite specific about who it should help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition feels very strongly that that principle should be adhered to and, of course, has designed a raft of amendments that seek to ensure that the ILC cannot go around hunting in native title country to buy land. I think we all understand that, so we have designed these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that Senator Evans said require highlighting. Firstly, part of that raft of amendments does suggest that the ILC could use the non-claimant application route, which quickly became known in the Joint Committee on Native Title as the `Latham method'. It is a little hypocritical of the minister to now describe that non-claimant application as `extraordinarily cumbrous', because this is a procedure which the government is telling industry around Australia that it should avail itself of. Every time an industry spokesman says, `We have uncertainty about where native title occurs, so we are not prepared to explore or invest for mining', the government's response&mdash;and particularly Mark Latham's response in the other place&mdash;is, `You have this non-claimant procedure and it is quite easy: you just go and put a non-claimant application in and it is dealt with and all the uncertainty is cleared up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is saying to the government that if it is good enough to clear up uncertainty in that way for the mining industry, it is clearly no less cumbersome for the ILC to do it. I do face the reality that the Greens, the Democrats and the government will not be supporting our amendments, so I will not delay the committee any longer on that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is interesting&mdash;and I am sure Senator Chamarette will be raising this later in the day&mdash;is that it has been good enough, however, for the government to draw a very clear distinction between native title land and land under the Northern Territory land rights act in subsection 191U(2) by making a very clear distinction about claims in the Northern Territory and ensuring that ILC land cannot be the subject of a claim there. So the principle that Senator Evans has held dear here has been emasculated in the government's treatment of the Northern Territory in that, certainly, the ILC cannot buy land that relates to a claim to land under that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of principle, we do believe strongly that there is a need to assist those who cannot assert native title rights. We accept the government's view that probably only five per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will be able to assert native title rights and that, clearly, there is a need to assist those others. With all the good intentions in the world, the ILC will be under enormous pressure to purchase land where there could be an overlap of native title. One of the practical reasons for that is that a lot of the Aboriginal organisations and individuals who have contact with land matters&mdash;land acquisition matters and land rights claims&mdash;are those people who are active and organised in those parts of Australia where the native title action is taking place at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those parts of Australia where we already have claims registered and accepted with the Native Title Tribunal are those parts of Australia where the Aboriginal interests on the ground are the most organised when it comes to land claims and those sorts of things. That is a practical matter on which the ILC will see itself coming under pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept, genuinely, the explanation of the government&mdash;and I can understand the process it has gone through in moving from the strict instruction of the preamble in the Native Title Act. I can understand the view that there could be a small bundle of rights granted to someone for native title and that it may well be in the best interests of those Aboriginals to be able to purchase the pastoral lease or the freehold title. We do not dispute that, I do not think. We are saying to the ILC that that is not the intention of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would think&mdash;and I am probably speaking out of school here&mdash;that had this amendment been passed by this place, then it would have been the coalition's view on coming into government that we would review the action of this provision in the three-year review we proposed, particularly after a period of, say, three to five years when we had seen the native title situation shake itself out a bit, where the uncertainty relating to native title claims would, hopefully, disappear, where the Australian community would understand where native title is and what it is, and indeed the actions of the Indigenous Land Corporation would have become clear as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying, in a very longwinded way, that this is probably the sort of provision that, had it been put into the bill, the coalition would have looked at in a practical light at a sensible juncture down the track&mdash;probably in three or five years&mdash;in order to accept the arguments that Senator Evans has put both at the committee hearing and here this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to clarify the issue of non-claimant applications. Of course we regard these as a very effective and practical way of testing the water in the standard situation where it is anticipated those provisions would apply. For example, if a mining company with an appropriate exploration interest in the land in question wants to know the status of that land before it embarks upon major potential investment activity. In that case, a single piece of land and a single competing interest are involved, and there is a simple process to be put in train.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we are talking about a corporation with a large purchasing strategy extending over the entire country&mdash;multiple parcels of land in different parts of the country&mdash;we have a different kind of environment in which this provision would apply. Moreover, there is a legal inhibition&mdash;which I should have mentioned before&mdash;on the non-claimant application provision being applied when a person does not hold an interest in the land in question, unless that person is a Commonwealth or state minister. The only three categories of people who can lodge non-claimant applications are people with an interest in the land or those who are Commonwealth or state ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the corporation has simply not yet acquired an interest in land, it would not have the legal standing to seek a non-claimant application, unless it were able to utilise a ministerial application for that purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put a point to the minister on reasons why I believe the two systems should be kept separate. It is more to do with commercial reasons. The minister said yesterday during question time that the benefit of this land fund was to give Aboriginals independence and some economic benefits. He went on to say that the economic benefit might be psychological. I would like the minister to explain `psychological economic benefit', but at some other time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I put to him is this. I presume that if a corporation bought land out of this fund, it may hold that land forever and a day if it wished to. That is if we are in the commercial world. To make it easy, if people buy a farm, station or whatever out of this fund, they have to make some sort of application. I will go down that line first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suppose a person buys a station. A few years down the track, he finds some reason why he does not want to stay on that station&mdash;perhaps he wants to move on to another one. I presume that that person would be quite free to sell that one and buy another one. But if the two systems run into each other, and someone decides to make a native title claim on that land then, whether it is successful or not, or whether it is waiting to be arbitrated upon, that would lessen the value of the property that person may wish to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my first point. This fund is for commercial purposes, as well as for other psychological economic reasons which the minister has mentioned. There could be a downgrading of the value of the place if the owners wanted to move on. It need not be a station; it might be a hobby farm close to the city. If the owners decide it is not what they want and they want to move on, the value of the property, in my view, would certainly drop if someone had come in and put in a land claim. So the owners would not be able to make a commercial decision to move somewhere else, unless an unending amount of money were available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, this amendment is an important one because it seeks to make clear the distinction between native title land and land purchased by the Indigenous Land Corporation. Those who oppose the amendment have a problem with the clarity of purpose of this legislation. If this legislation enables the Indigenous Land Corporation to purchase land which is already subject to a native title claim, it blurs the distinction between the fund, which is supposed to assist Aboriginals who are incapable of making native title claims, and the Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would assume that an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group which is capable of making a native title claim would have a lesser priority in calling on this fund than a group that is not. Those who oppose the amendment show that they have a grave problem with clarity of purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to cut through that confusion so that there is a clear distinction between those who are able to access land by virtue of a native title claim and those who are not. There are very real consequences to blurring the distinction and Senator Panizza has already touched on one of them&mdash;that a native title claim could severely depress the market value of land subject to that claim. If we blur the distinction, the following situation is quite foreseeable: an Aboriginal group makes a native title claim, the effect of that claim depresses the value of the property and maybe even makes it commercially unsaleable; that group then seeks to access the fund to pick up the property, the market value of which has been substantially reduced by virtue of the claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, at some later stage it might be decided that the claim had no validity but this creates the potential&mdash;I am not suggesting that this will happen in a great number of cases&mdash;for dealings in land which we would regard as less than satisfactory. It creates the potential for particular groups of claimants or particular groups of people seeking to access the fund to act in an unconscionable manner. We do not believe that that is fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle behind this legislation is to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups who cannot access land by virtue of a native title claim to be able to acquire that land and thereby achieve a sense of equality. However, if we create mechanisms which have the potential for gross unfairness, we negate the principle behind the legislation. That is what concerns us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment is not accepted a big problem might arise for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. Senator Campbell has already alluded to this but I wish to go into it in more detail. The problem is where different Aboriginal groups have competing claims to land. On Cape York Peninsula, an area with which I am very familiar, there are claims from different Aboriginal groups competing with the existing Wik claim. If one Aboriginal group in one part of the country makes a native title claim and another group seeks to access the fund to purchase some of that land subject to that claim, the result will be outright warfare between the two groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds like an extraordinary claim, but in places such as Aurukun and Kowanyama there is on-going internecine strife between people of one skin and people of another. All this will do is exacerbate tensions. It does not do anything to solve the lot of the Aboriginal community if these tensions are allowed to continue to simmer. If these tensions are exacerbated by virtue of the provisions of the legislation and by the operation of the fund, all that this will do is pit one Aboriginal group against another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While they are busy fighting amongst themselves, the real hope of the Australian community, which is for an advancement of the disadvantaged Aboriginal people, will be lost because all the energies are being channelled in a non-productive way instead of a productive way. That is something that concerns me immensely. It cannot but dismay anybody who visits these communities to see the strife, the tension and the violence. All we are saying is here is a way to ensure that that does not get worse, that we do not have one Aboriginal group pitted against another Aboriginal group. That is not an unreasonable request to have implemented in this legislation. That is why this amendment is critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said that this amendment has all sorts of thorns on it. Senator Gareth Evans said that one of those thorns is that it would take too long to access the non-claimant mechanism. Unfortunately, that is something the government put in place. The government put that non-claimant procedure in place. If it would take too long to access it, that is one of the government's defects in the native title legislation and that ought to be amended. But the government does not come before the chamber and say, `We want to amend it.' It recognises, from what Senator Evans said, that there are defects in that procedure. Where is the amendment bill to deal with that problem? It is not before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other comments that Senator Evans made in relation to that, and I thought this was extraordinary, was that he believed the amendment would require the Indigenous Land Corporation to check that there was no potential claim over the land. That is not what amendment No. 3 says. This amendment says that the Indigenous Land Corporation must not hold or acquire land or enable persons to hold or acquire land where an interest in that land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of the Native Title Act. This means there has to be either a declared right or a claimed right. But it would not require the Indigenous Land Corporation to go around and check whether any group believes it might bring a claim in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Evans misunderstood the amendment when he said that, and I can understand why he might have done so. But the amendment does not require the Indigenous Land Corporation to ascertain whether any group at any future point in time may be interested in lodging a claim. It only requires the corporation to check whether there is a claim or whether there is a decided interest in the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans says that it is too cumbersome to utilise the provisions of the Native Title Act to check the register, that then is a defect in the native title legislation. I do not believe that that is a valid argument against this amendment. I believe the amendment has a lot of merit, and I believe the committee would do well to support it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to his last point about the corporation having to satisfy itself about potential claims, that is certainly my reading of the opposition amendment because a native title right is something which exists whether or not it has been recognised through proper process or whether or not it has been the subject of a formal claim. The right is there. The question is whether or not it is acknowledged, recognised and registered in law. Either it exists or it does not exist. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that to satisfy itself that there were not going to be problems with native title claims, the corporation would have to, for all practical purposes, not only establish what claims had actually been lodged and what rights had actually been acknowledged by the tribunal but also search out the potential for such claims being lodged in the future. That is just the way I think the law would in fact operate and oblige it to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, I want to say that I think Senator O'Chee gives insufficient weight to the commonsense factor in all of this. We have an Indigenous Land Corporation which, let us face it, will have to resolve many potential conflicts between different claimants of Aboriginal groups and communities. It will have to prioritise claims somehow with a lot of clamour for simultaneous action occurring. In the case of particular communities living adjacent to each other, it will have to make some rather tough decisions, irrespective of the applicability of native title interests to the particular situation. We do have to rely on the good sense of the corporation that will be appointed and will be representative of indigenous people as a whole to get that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see, frankly, that the possibility of native title right issues intruding on the situation will make life very much more complex than it will be already for the corporation in dealing with some of these issues. When we take into account the problems that can arise if we absolutely seek to exclude native title right holders from access to these funds, the issues that I spelt out at the beginning, then I think the balance comes down very much in favour of keeping the bill as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Panizza's anxieties about land being devalued by a potential native title claim and spoiling its commercial utilisation, at least in terms of an on-selling transaction, I think it needs to be appreciated that this land has a lot of limitations on its alienability, anyway. People are only able to deal with the land with the consent of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear intention is that this, by and large, be land which is acquired on a more or less permanent basis. The possibility of a commercial rollover of a pastoral property or something is not excluded; the possibility for sale is not excluded. But the basic principle on which the act is constructed, by and large, is that land is being acquired for people to re-establish roots with, and to develop a relationship with, having lost that capacity through dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think as a practical matter there will be too many instances of those kinds of transactions that Senator Panizza seems to regard as the norm. If a question did arise about a competing native title based claim, then it would be possible for the corporation holding the land in question to itself take advantage of the non-claimant procedure in order to clarify the situation in exactly the same way as we have argued that other kinds of property owning interests should have that right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I repeat that while the non-claimant application is certainly a cumbrous procedure in the context of the corporation and the role that the corporation will be performing, it is not a cumbrous procedure for any individual interest holder to use in order to clarify the situation about his particular patch of dirt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that environment we are dealing with a finite, clear-cut issue, and it ought to be able to be resolved relatively simply. It is when we have simultaneous issues crowding in on us in multiple locations potentially all around the country and the need to clear the decks, as it were, before the transaction can proceed in any one of them, that I think it is an unreasonable restriction on the proposed role of the ILC. </PARA>

I might have been on the phone at the time. If I was, I do not ask the minister to respond. I will go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in a few days' time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the point about the non-claimant route is an important debate. The minister said that the ILC may have no standing because to have standing, people would have to have an interest in the land. It is exactly the same point that arises in relation to mining companies. Mining companies cannot find out whether there is any native title around until they have some sort of permit or interest in the land, and in many cases they do not have. However, the ILC would have the option&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble is that they cannot get the exploration permit until the state minister has formed an opinion that giving the permit to explore will not land the state government in a potential future compensation claim. That is one of the reasons the New South Wales government is not issuing exploration permits at the moment. It is not issuing exploration permits where there is any doubt about native title anywhere in New South Wales. I think Queensland is in the same situation. That will remain the situation until the federal government has resolved its negotiations with those governments as to the compensation agreement&mdash;which I understand is no closer to resolution than it was 15 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the government probably said back in June last year at the COAG meeting in Melbourne. I am sure Sir Humphrey Appleby would say the same thing. The ILC could establish an interest in the land quite practically by saying, in respect of a pastoral lease, `We will create an option to purchase that land. We have an intention.' From the equity point of view&mdash;and I can think of examples in the north-west of Western Australia, particularly in the Pilbara&mdash;there may well be Aboriginals who would have an interest in land, whose interest in the land from a native title right point of view has been extinguished because of past acts, and who may well be interested in purchasing pastoral leases or other property when they come up for sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the equitable side-effects of our no claimant application route for the ILC is that, if a mining company, for example, went to purchase a pastoral lease to develop a mine, that mining company would be required to place a non-claimant application. If the ILC went to purchase the same pastoral lease for the purpose of granting it to an Aboriginal organisation to run it as a pastoral lease, it would not be required to issue a non-claimant application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where that is inequitable for Aboriginal communities in the area who may be able to assert native title rights is that a group with a traditional link to that pastoral lease, because they may be some way away from that pastoral lease and unaware of property transactions in the region, will not know that the pastoral lease is available for sale or is about to be purchased, either by a mining company to develop a mine or by the ILC to develop it as a pastoral lease. The ILC, in good faith, may seek to buy the pastoral lease for an Aboriginal community when the potential native title claimants have no knowledge of it. The ILC could purchase the pastoral lease under the noses of people who may have the right to make a traditional&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The potential native title claimants, the people with a traditional link to that pastoral lease, will have that pastoral lease&mdash;their traditional land&mdash;sold to another group of Aboriginals who may have very good reasons for buying the pastoral lease but no traditional link to that land. I am using the Latham method: to be fair to the traditional owners, we require the ILC to put in a non-claimant application just to see if there are any traditional owners around. An Aboriginal community could purchase a pastoral lease with the assistance of the ILC and the traditional owners of that land may not even know it took place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans says, `Who cares?' He says, `Let the ILC go and buy traditional Aboriginal lands and be blowed to the traditional owners.' I do not believe that Senator Chris Evans could hold that view. He has obviously misunderstood me and I will have to make an explanation later under standing order 191. That is an essential and equitable part of what we are saying&mdash;that it is only right and proper that potential native title claimants be aware that the ILC is sniffing around to buy some land in the area, specifically looking to buy a pastoral lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potential native title claimants may well have a traditional link with that land but may never know what is taking place because the non-claimant application route that the government says is mandatory for anyone else in the world to go down to see whether there are native title claimants will not be required in the case of the Indigenous Land Corporation. I think Senator Gareth Evans is right: the ILC will use commonsense when seeking to determine these sorts of things. The non-claimant application route was put into the Native Title Act to be fair to potential claimants. What it does is say, `We're about to do something, we are about to purchase some land. Are there any claimants out there?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all senators who have been part of the native title debate know, some quite specific notice provisions are required to ensure that people who may have a native title claim to make are aware that some activity is about to take place and, if they have a native title claim, they should speak now or forever hold their peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the government is not going to support this amendment. But I think this is one of the important provisions that the ILC might take on board as a part of its commonsense approach to determining whether there are some traditional owners around before it goes and buys someone else a pastoral lease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government very strongly opposes this particular clause being picked up. It is important to clarify just how potentially destructive its operation would be. Whatever the intention with which this clause might be moved, its actual effect is potentially quite serious for Aboriginal beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the situation where a group of Aboriginal people with some kind of incomplete native title claim to a tract of land want the Indigenous Land Corporation to buy that land for them so that they can fully and comprehensively enjoy it. Let us take the situation of a traditional group with hunting, or fishing or access rights to a piece of land&mdash;unquestionably native title rights constituting native title interests and recognised as such, let us assume, by the tribunal and a claim lodged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the situation that I mentioned before where a group of Aboriginal people have an unquestioned native title right to one small corner of a tract of land, but want to be able to acquire the tract of land as a whole and establish a pastoral business there, or something of that kind. If this particular clause were to be passed in its present form, the Indigenous Land Corporation would be totally inhibited from proceeding with the acquisition of that land and the capacity accordingly to grant it to the very people who would be wanting it. The clause proposed to be added states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must take all reasonable steps, including, where appropriate, making a non-claimant application within the meaning of section 67 of the Native Title Act 1993&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there that the corporation would not have the capacity to make such an application technically if it did not itself, at that stage, have an interest in land. Leaving that aside, I will go on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the . . . Corporation must take all reasonable steps . . . to satisfy itself that any interest to be acquired in land is not subject to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if the corporation establishes that there is a credible native title right, either already recognised or in the process of being recognised, it would be absolutely inhibited, from the clear intention of the language of this section, from proceeding to the purchase because it would be utterly at odds with the substance of this section in that, having satisfied itself there was a native title right, it went ahead to purchase it anyway. It cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand what the intention probably was behind some of the speakers on this and what perhaps has made an initial impression on some people in this chamber. If it is a matter of untangling with some clarity in advance as to what land might clearly be the subject of a native title claim and what land might clearly not be the subject of any native title claim, it would be quite helpful, I suppose, as a practical matter, for the corporation to inform itself in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a practical matter, as we said, I am sure that it would not be inclined to go willingly down the path of getting itself into a potential conflict situation between native titleholder claimants and other claimants of the kind that has been described. If it were just seen as an exercise in clearing the conceptual decks to avoid the possibility of that kind of conflict between two different groups, yes, one could see the point of it. But the clause, as it is written, has the unintended consequence&mdash;but the very real consequence&mdash;of inhibiting the kinds of transactions that I have described, for which the potential is very real in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big problems is the twilight zone of people with some kind of connection with land, but maybe not enough to sustain a full-throated native title claim of a kind equivalent to ownership. So that is the problem we genuinely see with this clause. I really do think that, if this clause were to be passed, it would make an awful mess of the claims and aspirations of a possibly significant group of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the government is building a big, ugly, hairy-chested straw man in relation to its objections to this. The case that Senator Gareth Evans has just put is flawed. I will ask Senator Ellison to go to the core of that. But the fundamental principle here, particularly in light of the failure of the last amendments to be carried, is that there is now no specific requirement that the ILC cannot purchase native title land. So that has been cleared. We understand that the ILC in most of its duties will seek to give priority to the purchase of land for the benefit of those people who are not able to assert those rights. We do understand and share the view that there can be a lot of Aboriginal people who claim native title rights&mdash;it may only be a very small bundle of rights, including hunting and fishing, or just the right to traverse a piece of land&mdash;and that it is probably a matter of equity that they be assisted to buy a freehold or a pastoral lease and therefore enjoy full possessory rights. We understand that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeking to do here&mdash;and it is as much a matter of equity for the Aboriginal traditional owners&mdash;is to require the ILC to take reasonable steps. If we look at the wording of the legislation, we see that it simply requires them to take all reasonable steps. It does not actually require them to even do a non-claimant application; it simply says that where it is considered reasonable, they do a non-claimant application. So with regard to a situation where they are looking at buying a particular property, Senator Evans would have us believe that if they were looking to buy something in a particular area, they would have to put up a non-claimant application and it would create some sort of massive bureaucratic problem by so doing. But this actually requires that when they are buying a property they take these reasonable steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases it may be entirely reasonable not to have to bother about even looking for native title because there may never be any native title likely in the area. But where there is likely to be native title in the area, where it is considered reasonable&mdash;that might be in the situation which I described earlier whereby there is a suggestion that there may be some traditional owners&mdash;they go down this route. Reasonable steps may well include having the normal sorts of discussions that a mining company will have anywhere around Australia. Sensible mining companies which are good corporate citizens, when they are about to do some activity in an area, most mining companies these days&mdash;I refer to companies such as Hamersley Iron, Western Minerals NL which now owns the Cadjebut mine and some of the other examples that we saw recently during the visit by the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title to north-west Australia&mdash;consult with the local communities. They get to know who the local traditional people are and they generally work very well with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of reasonable step that this amendment would envisage. It goes no further than that. It does not require the ILC to go any further than that. The ILC now can take the reasonable steps, find out what sort of rights exist and then proceed under all the other principles enunciated in the body of the bill. We think that it is only reasonable that the ILC be required to determine whether there are any other Aboriginals who can assert rights in the area. That is all that this requires the ILC to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We consider it entirely unreasonable that the ILC would be able to go down this path without determining whether those rights do exist. As I said earlier, it is quite possible that there are traditional owners in the region or anywhere who may want to assert rights or who may need to be aware that they should assert rights. They will not have any notice provided to them unless the ILC has a specific requirement that it seeks to determine those rights. As I said, I would welcome a contribution from Senator Ellison as to the other fundamental flaw in the specific example given by Senator Evans. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt it was quite reasonable that there be some acknowledgment that all reasonable steps should be taken to be satisfied as to what interests were present in the land in relation to native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in relation to the aspect of the pastoral lease that Senator Gareth Evans mentioned, of course, it is still open for the Indigenous Land Corporation to grant the pastoral lease to the dispossessed community or individual&mdash;in this case it has to be a corporation, but if our amendments are passed, it could be that&mdash;and that part of the land which is affected by native title could be excluded and reserved and set aside for particularly that native title claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about native title where there is a claim to traverse the land or to hunt or fish. Those activities relate normally to specific areas. It is well known that in relation to these aspects in the past, Aboriginal people have used a tract of land&mdash;they have traditionally, historically, adopted a path they have gone backwards and forwards on, and have hunted in a certain area. That, therefore, does not take it beyond the realms of possibility of allowing the ILC to come to a pastoral lease and acquire the lease for the purposes of giving it to those people who cannot maintain native title but to excise that part of the lease where native title could be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Indigenous Land Corporation granted the land to community A, and community A was dispossessed and did not have native title, and community B could maintain native title over that land, the two communities could be drawn into possible conflict because, naturally, the traditional users would want to exert a claim over that land. But other Aboriginal people, perhaps from the town, the city or wherever, nonetheless dispossessed, would be in possession of that land because the ILC had granted it to them&mdash;so there is a possible conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could get around that quite easily by excising any portion of the land, saving that for the native title claimants and granting the rest of the land to those people who had been dispossessed&mdash;that is quite possible. In fact, in Western Australia pastoral leases have reservations on them. Some of those pastoral stations in the north-west allow traditional land users access to certain areas&mdash;wells and things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that the acquisition of that particular pastoral lease might not necessarily be impeded, as Senator Evans said. This legislation asks the Indigenous Land Corporation to take reasonable steps to ensure that it does not run into conflict with any native title claims. For instance, native title claims are pending in the north-west. Those have been made by various groups. It would be folly on the part of the Indigenous Land Corporation to go ahead and acquire land which is the subject of those claims for other Aboriginal groups because it would bring them into clear conflict. In the section which deals with the performance of functions, I think it is imperative that the Indigenous Land Corporation have some guidance as to how it should perform its functions&mdash;and this is a very important area&mdash;so it does not lead Aboriginal groups into unnecessary conflict. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ILC satisfies itself after it has taken reasonable steps. The land corporation can look at a claim in an area. For example, on the outskirts of Kalgoorlie there might be an area where the ILC wants to grant land to an Aboriginal community. The ILC makes inquiries about the location and finds out that there is no possibility, or there is a very unlikely possibility, of a native title claim. It then goes ahead and acquires the land. The corporation has fulfilled its functions under this subsection because it has satisfied itself that it has taken reasonable steps. But if the ILC knew full well that this land was the subject of a claim, or that there was a claim pending by a group which had traditional ties with that land, and went ahead and still acquired it willy-nilly, it would be in contravention of this because it had not taken reasonable steps; it had ignored an existing situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is for those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have been dispossessed, those people who cannot maintain a claim for native title. In fact, the preamble to the Native Title Act, which refers to this very land fund, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>They are, very clearly, people who cannot claim native title. So if we had a community which could lay native title claim to an area, it would not need the assistance of this land fund because it has the remedy of the Native Title Act. It may be that a group cannot maintain any strong claim at all and that it wants to claim that piece of land. The land corporation looks at it and says, `Well, we have looked at their claim. It really isn't going to get anywhere. We can acquire the piece of property concerned.' But, where a claim is up and running, it would be folly to acquire that land and then grant it to another Aboriginal group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation says that the Indigenous Land Corporation has to take reasonable steps. It does not say,`You must not do this'. All it says is that the ILC must take reasonable steps to ensure that this land is not the subject of a native title claim. It is a judgment that it has to satisfy itself, not the world at large. So the ILC can say, `Well, look, there is a claim considered. But we are satisfied that this is not a claim which is going anywhere, and we can safely acquire the land and give it to this other community who are not native title aspirants.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans raised the example of a pastoral property where, in a section of that property, there are hunting and fishing rights, and said that that could be excised and left for the native title claimant and the rest of the property acquired for those who come from town, who can use it and operate it in a commercial sense with the other part excised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the inclusion of the reference to the non-claimant application is of concern to the Greens, the coalition could reconsider its stance on that. We are simply saying, `Take reasonable steps, including a non-claimant application.' That is not a compulsion; it is there by way of example. It really means, `Take reasonable steps, including that step, if necessary.' But if that is causing the Greens concern, I would be willing to defer the matter for clarification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, there has been some discussion around the chamber and it might be possible to reach some sensible agreement on this amendment. The difficulty is not so much with the Indigenous Land Corporation informing itself as to the existence of native title competing claims and building that into the judgments that it makes; the difficulty is with the corporation being hogtied by finding that there is some, perhaps only very small or marginal, native title right and, as a result, being inhibited from doing something that it and the people of a particular area want done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is essentially a drafting problem and I think we can resolve it by changing the drafting so that, instead of the corporation having to satisfy itself, the basic idea would be that the corporation would have to inform itself whether these competing interests exist. In informing itself, it would be appropriate, if the corporation itself deemed it appropriate and if it were technically available, to go down the route of a non-claimant application. We could rewrite the clause as follows. The first line remains as is. It would read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In performing its land acquisition functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must take reasonable steps&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>delete the word `all'&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>delete the word `not'-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to native title or native title rights and interests within the meaning of section 223 of that Act.".</PARA>
<PARA>I think that meets the perceived need for some clarification. Given the other obvious practical constraints and the whole thrust of the legislation, which is designed, so far as is possible, to meet non-native title interests but rather the interests of other people who have been dispossessed, that would give the corporation a sufficient armory to deal with these situations in a satisfactory way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say at the outset that the question of the preamble to the Native Title Act has been mentioned many times. It is from that preamble that we have the very origin of this bill. I will not recite again that part of the preamble which relates to this land fund, but that is where it comes from. It is that part which says those people who cannot maintain this native title are to be the beneficiaries under this bill. It is fairly clear, but nonetheless very important, and it is an aspect which this bill does not address. It should be at the very forefront of the bill. It should be there as a guiding beacon to any reader of the bill as to where this bill is going and what it is intending to do. I notice that the Democrats have adopted words which are similar to the opposition proposal in incorporating this part of the preamble. To that extent, I think that is a good step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent hearing in relation to this bill, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration heard evidence on this very point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the New South Wales Land Council assisted us greatly in the drafting of this. I have here a letter from the President of the Aboriginal Justice Committee of the Law Society of New South Wales supporting this very amendment. In that letter, Mr Fairlie, the president of that committee, states that recently in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Mason v. Tritton, Mr Justice Priestley referred to this preamble in the Native Title Act and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the . . . preamble set out at page 7 above, was established by Subsection (1) of Section 201 of the Native Title Act for the purpose, stated in Subsection (2) of assisting Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire land and manage it in a way that provides them with economic, environmental, social or cultural  benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>What he was saying there was that principles such as those contained in the preamble or the objects of an act are very important when deciding a case. He referred to the principles that are mentioned. Mr Fairlie, the president of that committee of the New South Wales Law Society, put this forward as a very important aspect to consider in how the courts will approach legislation. In his letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land Fund Bill does not provide guidelines as to how money drawn from the land fund should be distributed . . . It is essential that such guidelines should be specified in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this can be contained in the objects. I think the opposition's amendment does that commendably. What we have in subparagraphs (a) through to (e) of the amendment are the very guidelines that Mr Justice Priestley had said are important when we decipher what legislation is for. He was not looking at this particular aspect but he was saying that we must have guidelines, in effect. What the opposition said here is that, in the performance of its powers, the following principles should be adhered to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the functions and powers must be performed and exercised in the way that, in the opinion of the person performing them, best promotes the object of this Part;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands;</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the money can only go so far and that if one is stretched, if one is a bit tight for funds, then one is guided by subparagraph (b) to look at those who are the most severely dispossessed. Subparagraph (c) of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">community based Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land bodies should be recognised . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is, we recognise them and use them to their fullest extent. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) significant regard must be had to the views of those bodies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) administrative cost should be kept to a minimum and duplication of administrative capabilities should be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very clear guidelines indeed as to how this Indigenous Land Corporation is to work. It is to make sure that it does not duplicate administration&mdash;that is, that it does not waste money on bureaucracy, on inefficiency or on duplicating functions, because if money is wasted, there will be less in the pot for the recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These principles make it easier for the Indigenous Land Corporation to function. I would say, with the greatest of respect, that it is to be preferred to the Democrats' proposal. The Democrats' proposal does not go that far in its detail. The summary in paragraph (3) states that the views of the bodies concerned, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and bodies, be taken on board. It does not talk about avoiding duplication of administration, it does not talk about giving preference to those more severely dispossessed if a conflict should arise, and it does not go into the detail, I would submit, that is necessary in offering guidelines to the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case that I mentioned at the outset was quoted by Mr Fairleigh in his letter. What he was driving at was that when the courts look at how a piece of legislation is to function, they look to what is in the legislation, what guidelines there are, what the objects are and what parameters are set. By including this in the legislation, we are making it very clear to anyone who comes after what this Indigenous Land Corporation should be doing and how it should be handling its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the New South Wales Land Council, after a good deal of thought, has arrived at this as a very succinct way of outlining these guidelines that the Indigenous Land Corporation has to adhere to. As I say, the preamble is an essential part. It must be included in this bill, and it is not. That is a defect, which is recognised by the Democrats in their amendment. I can only say that the coalition agrees with the first aspect of the Democrats amendment which deals with the preamble, but not the remaining part of it, and I have already outlined the reasons for that.

If we are just stating it as something sitting around in the abstract which the corporation ought to somehow have regard to, we might be able to live with that. But in the very tightly drafted form in which it appears here and as one of the principles that have to be adhered to, it has a capacity to drive a coach and horses through the rational administration of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there will be resource allocation conflicts, and that is exactly why we are appointing a corporation to resolve them. It should be enabled to get on with the job, using all the wisdom, experience and commonsense its individual members may have accumulated over the years. We will certainly have regard to those qualities when appointing to the board. I know Senator Harradine has a certain disposition which says that commonsense is not something one finds in large measure in people charged with responsibilities of this kind. He may or may not be right, but I say to Senator Harradine that there ain't no commonsense in vesting this kind of weapon in those who might, for whatever reason, be minded to make life difficult for the administration of this particular new regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agony of trying to make sense of the concept of more or less or most severe dispossession I do not think should be underestimated. I do not think I am gilding the lily on this one. It is something that I really feel quite strongly is creating a potential nightmare. The Democrats' recipe avoids that. It has in it, for all practical purposes, all the other components of the opposition amendment. For that reason I suggest that as a responsible legislature we ought to support the Democrat alternative. </PARA>

The concerns that have been expressed by the government and by Senator Kernot that it would allow for excessive disputes and divisiveness are not appropriate.

This is a land fund. It is a fact how much land people own or not. It was in discussion with an Aboriginal person yesterday that I realised that there are many creative and constructive ways of looking at this dilemma. One simply has to look at the communities in the region and see how much land they have. It is really quite easy to determine who has none and who has some.

As Senator Ellison said, this is a beacon; it is a principle&mdash;just as is the preamble to the Native Title Act, which Senator Kernot in December described as a splendid preamble. She went so far as to say that the preamble should be incorporated in the Australian constitution. Much of what is said in that preamble, which goes on for over two pages, in the Native Title Act are matters that put some quite specific requirements and principles into place. Again, they are principles that need to be interpreted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has again built up a big, hairy-chested straw man and said that we will create a legal nightmare and the sky will cave in if we have this amendment as part of the preamble to this section of the act. It is simply not the truth, nor the case, that this creates any problem whatsoever. If it did, then the Democrats would not agree with the words `meaningful title', in relation to the title we are talking about, particularly in the first paragraph of this amendment, which we have both agreed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to talk about legal interpretation and creating a legal nightmare, if it is proposed that putting in the words `most dispossessed' does that, it could equally say that `meaningful title' does that. We all know the reason why the words `meaningful title' are in the objects&mdash;because the government could not live with the strictness of the preamble to the Native Title Act that this fund would be established to assist those who are unable to assert native title rights. As Mr Ridgeway from the New South Wales Land Council said, the main reason why this fund was taken out of that act and put into a separate act was so that the preamble could be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's initial position was that that particular part of the preamble which has been quoted a number of times today should be exported out of the Native Title Act and put into this bill. As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate, the government has taken that part of the preamble to the Native Title Act and put a big red line through it. It is now a redundant part of the preamble. It is the most significant change to the Native Title Act which has taken place since December. The government has put a line through that paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word `meaningful' is certainly open to interpretation. Had the words `native title' been there, as they appear in the preamble to the Native Title Act, it would have been quite clear&mdash;it would have been quite restrictive and quite proscriptive. The word `meaningful' has been placed in there because it allows some discretion. It is quite sensible in some ways because it says, `We will assist people who are unable to assert meaningful title.' With regard to the calamity that the government and the Democrats have agreed can occur in relation to the words `most dispossessed', that term represents a very fine principle&mdash;to assist those who have been most dispossessed. It does not need to be finely interpreted. One does not need to go to the High Court and argue over who is the most dispossessed. It is a principle. As Senator Ellison said, it is a beacon. </PARA>

The same people will be able to go to the court and argue about whether or not they have got meaningful title. If people have been severely dispossessed of their land, have applied for assistance by the ILC and have been rejected on the grounds that they have got some meaningful title, they will go to the court and say, `I've got hunting and fishing rights over this piece of land; I want assistance to buy the piece of land,' while the ILC says, `No, you've got some meaningful title.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether they are just being disingenuous or whether they do not really understand the way in which these clauses actually work but the truth of the matter is that there is a big difference between the general language of a preamble or, in this instance, the general language of 191A(a) which refers to the principles of dispossession. It creates a context within which the corporation should and will operate and creates a `bias' in favour of assisting those who have been dispossessed and, arguably, those who have been most dispossessed. All of that is part of the flavour of that preambular language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a hell of a difference between that sort of language and the kind of language found in the principal section in 191A(b). Here it is not just talking about the general things to which the corporation is to have regard; it is talking about principles that it has to adhere to, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) if a conflict arises as to allocation preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a stark criterion to be employed and which is, by its very nature, testable in the courts. We all know enough about land council politics and competition within Aboriginal communities and the way in which these things have evolved so far to know that it will not be very long before this kind of provision is tested in the courts. That will create a terrible dilemma not only for the courts but also, of course, for the corporation in trying to make this thing work in practice and avoid this kind of hassle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to some other problems that the corporation will be confronting if this clause goes in and which the courts will be confronting if there are contested claims. The previous clause of the bill, 191E(3), states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purposes of the performance of the Indigenous Land Corporations land management functions, the Indigenous Land Corporation must have regard to the desirability of the following:-</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indigenous Land Corporation must act in accordance with sound business principles whenever it performs its functions on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA>It is perfectly possible to imagine a particular scenario evolving where it is very difficult to apply sound environmental or business principles to a particular claimant who arguably might be more dispossessed than some other claimant. There might be a more dispossessed claimant who, in the judgment of the corporation, is manifestly less well equipped to carry out the management standards that are inherent in this legislation, or to advance the sort of business principles that are also the responsibility of the corporation to advance. </PARA>

That is the principle, and it makes a farce of what the minister is saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very small amendment to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Act of 1993. Clause 6A(5) of the act reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations may make provision for or in relation to exempting providers from the requirements of this section.</PARA>
<PARA>The section in turn refers to providers operating a trust account. In other words, at the moment they can be exempted entirely from those provisions. The amendment that the Senate is debating today changes that particular subclause to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations may make provision for or in relation to exempting providers, either wholly or partly, from some or all of the requirements of this section.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if this small amendment is passed today, the government can make regulations that would exempt providers from part of the obligation and not simply from the whole of the obligation. The need to make this amendment has come about as a result of negotiations with which the Senate would be very familiar. Nevertheless, I will remind the Senate very briefly of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 after the financial collapse of a large private college, the Commonwealth was forced to fund the loss at a cost of about $2.2 million. It was decided to strengthen the ESOS act to protect further students' prepaid fees. In December 1993, legislation was passed which required education providers to have trust accounts for prepaid student fees and also to be members of a tuition assurance scheme. The detail of these schemes was to be provided in regulations that had to be in place by 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government finally tabled the regulations in parliament on 1 June, less than one month before they were due to come into effect. In response to massive industry concern, Senator Bell gave notice that he would be moving to disallow the regulations. On a motion moved by me, on behalf of the coalition, the regulations were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In other words, we believed that disallowance alone did not resolve the problems and that, in fact, the Senate, through its committee structure, could contribute to what were the deficiencies in the government's proposed regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of evidence that was presented to the committee, particularly evidence from the industry which criticised the regulations as being unworkable, impractical and unfair, there followed further consultation between the government agencies and the industry groups. On 28 June, Mr Crean announced that the government had backed down. Agreement had been reached between industry and his department and changes would be made to the regulations and to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has since made and tabled regulations which provide for the changes agreed to with regard to the tuition assurance scheme. It is now proposed to amend the act in order that the agreement in relation to trust account reforms can be implemented by means of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticipated regulations which will flow from the amendment to the act will allow for payment of only 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent of prepaid tuition fees into trust accounts, with current provisions for draw-downs of a further 25 per cent on course commencement and thereafter weekly in arrears. This will take into account common industry practices, where offshore agents deduct their 20 per cent commission before forwarding the balance of the students' course fees to the provider in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticipated regulations will also allow for a non-refundable enrolment fee of no more than $250. This will cover payment of administrative costs incurred before the student arrives in Australia, costs which are incurred regardless of whether the student eventually obtains a visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the agreed amended regulations and they are agreed by us also. I reiterate what I said when last this issue was before the Senate, that the final negotiated agreement represents a major victory for the Senate&mdash;a victory, we would say, for the coalition in referring the matter to the Senate committee which facilitated this satisfactory outcome, and also a victory, I guess the Australian Democrats would say, for the Democrats in moving the notice of disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the government, through its bungling, nearly put at risk the viability and international competitiveness of a major export industry. I hope that the government has learnt lessons from this experience. We certainly commend to the Senate the amendment which is now before the chamber, because it now enables the government to make regulations that are satisfactory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1994, which amends the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. In particular, I support the comments of my colleague Senator Hill, who outlined what has happened with this legislation and the subsequent regulations. It is a great victory for the Senate that finally we have arrived at this point. I would remind the Senate that this has taken some years&mdash;years that would not have been necessary if the government had been prepared to listen to the reasoned arguments of the Senate, in particular the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and also the main industry providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have finally&mdash;after two years&mdash;got to the point suggested by the industry and by this parliament. It was a rather painful and tortuous process. An enormous amount of work was undertaken by the industry and by this parliament to get to the position where we should have been in the first place. That is very surprising. It almost brought a sense of deja vu about what happened in this same area when I first came into parliament. Mr Dawkins as the minister at the time wanted to bring in draconian regulations to regulate this industry but he was blocked by the Senate; yet again, two years later, we have found the same thing happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most heartening outcomes of all this&mdash;as I suppose often happens&mdash;was that, despite what the government was doing, the industry still managed to boom. I think that was due partly to the fact that we managed to have a deregulatory framework early on in the piece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 3 1/2 years I have been in parliament, this industry has grown from a $800 million industry to one of $1,500 million. In other words, it has almost doubled in a four-year period. It was very necessary that this deregulatory framework which we started should stay. Despite that, and despite what happened in 1991-92, when we got to December 1993 the government proposed&mdash;yet again&mdash;to bring in more draconian controls, and in a way that was going to put up costs to the industry and force a lot of marginal providers out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government legislated to establish trust accounts for prepaid student fees. We all agree that protecting student fees is an excellent idea but the way in which the government was going about it was by creating a tuition assurance scheme. It could not really define it in the earlier stages but it would have needed a reassurance proposal where the students' money would have had to have been protected in a system that would have added greatly to the costs of the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing things about the proposal at that time was that the government decided to create a regulatory framework and did not have the full details of how this tuition assurance scheme was going to be established, who was going to run it and the way in which contributions were to be collected. It said it was going to leave all this to regulation. This created a very dangerous precedent, not just in terms of educational legislation but in terms of legislation in this parliament. If we give away the right to give full scrutiny to legislation in this parliament, we are just handing the true role of the parliament over to the bureaucrats. As all members of the Senate know, if we do not put things in the act, if we put them in the regulations, they can be changed. We have a regulations and ordinances committee but its members cannot offer the scrutiny that this parliament offers. So parliament did move and, over time, has changed the whole approach to put it back into the act. That is precisely what the industry wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous concern by the different groups in the education export industry. I speak particularly of ACPET, which is in the area of business education; ELICOS, which is in the business of language education; the TAFE colleges and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. When this proposed change was put up originally in late 1993, there was not a great deal of consultation with these groups. When consultation did occur, it seemed that DEET was not listening. It had its own hidden agenda; it was still working on its command economy model out of the Dawkins era. It knew best. It was a top-down scheme; it was one that was not sensitive to the needs of the industry and was going to raise the costs of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of all this was that we had great uncertainty and interference for the period of 18 months and that is most regrettable. The government action was widely criticised by the industry and by overseas students. They wanted a workable framework for quality assurance and safeguards of student prepaid fees but they did not want the heavy-handed bureaucratic approach that was proposed by the government. The government's proposal was going to put up their costs and take away the independence of educational providers. It was going to hamper their international competitiveness. The concern of the Senate standing committee meant that we had a referral to scrutinise this whole process. We had a series of hearings where evidence that was highly critical was presented by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting innovation in Senate practice is that quite often we hold a series of half-day or one-day hearings where we bring industry representatives in and we have the government departments sitting there through it. They have to respond to what the industry is saying and then we have a round table conference to try to resolve the matter. That was not making much headway until DEET was finally mugged by the reality of what the parliament can do in terms of stopping inappropriate legislation. The combination of Senator Bell's disallowance motion and Senator Hill's referral to the committee was where the government really had a gun to its head and had no option but to cave in, back down and accept the recommendations of this parliament and the recommendations of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of this bill are that the government's anticipated regulations will now allow for a payment of 80 per cent&mdash;not 100 per cent as required by section 6A of the 1991 act&mdash;of prepaid tuition fees into trust accounts. This is what the industry wanted. It will provide for further draw-downs from the trust accounts of 25 per cent on commencement of courses and then weekly in arrears. Again, that is what the industry wanted. It takes into account the common practice of 20 per cent of the money being retained offshore before forwarding the balance to Australia. Under the system proposed by DEET the locals would have to cover that. It also allows for a non-refundable enrolment fee of $250 for administrative costs incurred by the local industry. This very satisfactory outcome is only possible because of the measures I mentioned above, and it is a real win for Senate scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of my colleague Minister Crean I want to put a couple of points on the record about the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1994 and the regulations that go with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of Australia's international education industry depends upon the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake, and the protection of moneys they invest in receiving an Australian education. The ESOS act was first introduced in 1991 following the damage caused to Australia's reputation by the financial collapse of several private education providers and consequent publicity overseas about the problems of students who lost money as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on the ESOS bill in 1991, the Senate watered down the protection offered by the act to international students. The limitations of the 1991 ESOS act were subsequently exposed by the collapse of further institutions, causing over 430 international students to lose their prepaid fees. The government had to refund $1.3 million to affected students in order to protect Australia's reputation. I notice that Senator Hill and Senator Tierney did not claim any credit for being involved in watering down the 1991 act, so that we again had weaknesses which cost  Australian taxpayers another $1.3 million, which is typical of the profligate attitude which the opposition has about public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following college failures during 1993, the ESOS act was amended in December 1993 to strengthen the protection that the act offers to international students' prepaid funds. These amendments included the requirement for providers to deposit all prepaid course money received directly or indirectly from international students into notified trust accounts and to withdraw those funds in accordance with the regulations. Regulations prescribing the draw-down requirements of funds from the trust accounts and the requirements for providers to be members of a tuition assurance scheme&mdash;TAS&mdash;were subject to notices of motion of disallowance and later referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The notices of motion disallowance of the regulations were withdrawn on 23 August 1994 following acceptance by the Senate of Mr Crean's proposed package of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Senate standing committee hearing on regulations in June, the minister proposed a package of amendments to the legislation which addressed industry concerns about the trust account provisions in return for retaining the TAS provision in a modified form to meet the government's concerns for a safety net to protect the interests of international students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the regulations which give effect to these proposals relating to the TAS requirements have been made; amendments to the trust account regulations require an amendment to the principal act. Currently providers who are not exempt from the financial regulations of the ESOS act are required to deposit all prepaid course money received directly or indirectly from international students into notified trust accounts, and to withdraw these funds in accordance with the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has expressed concern that these regulations, in particular the drawn-down percentages, are too strict and that the money can only be withdrawn from trust accounts after the student receives a visa. The current amendments to the act seek to provide for more flexible exemption provisions to give effect to the proposals to ensure not only the protection of international students' prepaid funds, but also that the industry is able to operate without encountering cash flow problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the proposed amendment to the ESOS act, the ESOS regulations may make provisions for exempting providers either wholly or partly from the requirement to deposit 100 per cent of the prepaid course money they receive from overseas students. This amendment will enable amendments to the ESOS regulations which will exempt providers from depositing 20 per cent of the prepaid tuition fees, to take into account common industry practices where offshore agents deduct their commissions before forwarding the balance of the students' course fees to the provider in Australia. Providers will also be exempt from depositing an enrolment fee of no more than $250. With this amendment to the act, the government is confident that Australia's education and training, and export industry can grow and develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to say that one of the great successes in economic development terms as well as in education terms for this government over the last 11 1/2 years has been to transform education services into being a major export industry now earning Australia several billion dollars a year in export earnings, and to establish that as a major industry in Australia, adding to the economic wealth and therefore to the employment opportunities of many Australians. This bill further enhances those opportunities. The development of this industry is one of the great achievements of the present government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is to amend a number of acts administered within the portfolio of the Attorney-General. The bill contains some amendments of a minor policy nature. The bill amends the Law Officers Act 1964 to allow the Governor-General to appoint a person to act as Solicitor-General during a vacancy in the office of Solicitor-General or in circumstances where the Solicitor-General is unable to perform the functions of the office. The bill also amends the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 to provide that, apart from an initiating process or subpoena, service may be effected in certain circumstances at the address for service of the company or registered body in the proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important provisions of the bill are the amendments to the Trade Practices Act: to increase the penalties for breaches of product safety and information provisions of the act and to amend the basis upon which an officer may exercise his or her powers of entry without warrant to inspect unsafe goods; further, to allow the secretary to the department responsible for the enforcement of the product safety and information provisions of the act to accept and apply to the court to enforce written undertakings in connection with matters in which he or she has powers or functions under the act; and also to allow the use of penalty infringement notices as an alternative to prosecution for failure to notify the minister of a voluntary recall of unsafe goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, the most contentious aspects of the bill are probably those aspects which concern the desirability of conferring powers of entry on authorised officers of the Trade Practices Commission. In this regard the bill amends division 1A of part V of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with product safety and product information. Section 65Q of this part confers upon the minister or authorised officers the power to obtain information and documents from a supplier relating to goods which will or may cause injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Some concerns were raised which did not relate directly to these amendments but to the provisions in the principal act. The committee thought that at some future stage it would be useful for the Attorney-General and for parliament to revisit the reasons for the original provision of powers for officers of the Trade Practices Commission to have the right to enter premises in the way in which the act now allows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally feel that there is an argument of justification in this area because we are dealing with public safety. We are dealing possibly with a situation where a product which is dangerous to the health of people&mdash;perhaps a toy which is dangerous to the health of children&mdash;could be released unless the manufacturer or trader concerned could be stopped at very short notice from doing so. We need to balance the civil liberties arguments that are being brought on behalf of the manufacturer with the argument of safeguarding public health. It is not an argument, in my view, that these provisions have not been used since they were introduced a number of years ago, because an emergency could arise at any moment. I believe that this chamber and this parliament would not wish to soften provisions which might prevent a tragedy in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I comment briefly on one amendment which has become necessary due to a drafting error in the bill. That is in group 6, paragraph 65Q(3)(b), which was intended to add, `and in order to prevent the goods in question from being concealed, lost or destroyed, or from being removed from the premises.' This is a very good explanation as to why these powers need to be exercised and why they need to be there. Unfortunately, such powers are not given by the principal act and this paragraph, if passed, would have caused a conflict and made the provisions virtually inoperable. That was the advice of officers from the Attorney-General's Department and I understand that the government is moving to remove that. While it is obviously technically necessary to remove these words, I believe that they are a good expression and a good description of why these provisions are necessary. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just summarise, in relation to provisions, that this Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 covers the areas of legislation of the Law Officers Act 1964, which Senator Spindler has outlined, and the Service and Execution of Process Act as well. They really are quite straightforward amendments and are very sensible indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem, of course, arises in the Trade Practices Act, and Senator Spindler has touched on the areas of concern. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recently held a hearing in relation to this. It came to light that there was some concern in relation to the powers of entry that some of these officers had&mdash;powers which really were akin to police powers. I am referring to section 65Q of the legislation. In my dissenting report to that report by the legal and constitutional affairs committee, I indicated that a complaint has been levelled by the Australian Federal Police Association that, under the present act, officers concerned had these powers without having the relevant training. Mr Law, who appeared for that association, was of the view that governments should be very cautious in giving any public officers powers of police entry or powers of police seizure where they do not have the necessary training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian Federal Police have that training and, indeed, are qualified to carry out those powers. Really, the section itself needs revisiting. As I understand the amendment, it limits the powers of the officers in some way rather than extending them as had initially been thought. Quite frankly, the section itself, which was brought in in 1986, ought to be looked at and we should query whether the officers concerned should have those powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also, during that hearing, some questioning of the efficacy of this amendment. The report, in dealing with the amendment to 65Q(3)(b), stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence before the Committee indicated that there was a serious deficiency in the proposed amendment . . . Ms Johnson of the Attorney-General's Department gave evidence that the additional requirement could never be met. The amendment adds the additional condition that the entry must be required in order to prevent the goods in question from being concealed, lost or destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>In evidence, Ms Johnson stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It actually makes it impossible ever to exercise the power, in our view, because the additional requirement can never be met.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Spindler, who was questioning her at that stage, asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you explain that in a bit more detail, please?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Johnson stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional requirement is the protection of evidence. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . and in order to prevent the goods in question from being concealed, lost or destroyed or from being removed from the premises.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an additional requirement before the power can be exercised and there is no power in the act to do any of those things. They cannot seize all the goods. They cannot prohibit the person who owns or has charge of the goods from doing anything with them until a few days later when the minister makes his prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where the section in the first instance has some deficiency in that it affords too much power to a public officer. Then we have the proposed amendment, of which we have here evidence that it is unworkable. The government should really look at this closely. It is an aspect which needs attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of increasing penalties initially caused me some concern. However, I do not think that this really is sufficient to make a stand on. It is related to the penalty points that, as I understand it, the Commonwealth is now using. That is appropriate. The main concern I have in relation to this matter is the police type powers of entry that some of these officers have. That aspect needs review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. If I can help the minister, who used to be the transport minister and should have been aware of this, the strategic plan from the CAA in September 1994 provides for a substantial cut. It is a document that has been fairly widely circulated, so I do ask the minister to bring this matter to the minister's attention. Obviously, the minister is not aware of it either or he would not be acting in the cavalier way that he is, but it is a 10 per cent reduction in fire safety personnel. I ask the minister to get the transport minister to seriously look at this proposal and not to let it happen if the proposal is to reduce fire safety services at Sydney airport and, I might say, at other airports around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the Leader of the Opposition's irritability in this chamber today is caused by the glowing reports he had of how brilliantly Senator Alston performed in his absence in question time yesterday. Who is saying `Hear, hear!'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with interest an editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Farmers bank on good terms'. The editorial pointed out that it is crucial to national prosperity that rural Australia be given every opportunity to recover from the worst drought in living memory. It said that the ability to cope with debt will be central to that recovery, and I agree wholeheartedly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I met with representatives of major banks and pastoral houses yesterday. The banks expressed the view that the government's policy settings are sound and that the rural adjustment scheme is well targeted towards assisting viable farm enterprises. In particular, the recent changes, which they noted, I must say, in exceptional circumstances RAS to a demand driven program were seen as a significant boost to the effectiveness of the scheme and its ability to deliver maximum assistance to eligible farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister underlined the importance the government placed on the ongoing support of financial institutions to their rural clients. He also made the point that financial institutions and government must work together to ensure that viable farm enterprises survive the current drought and have the resources to manage the recovery once the drought breaks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did receive assurances that farm clients would be treated responsibly and risk margins would, wherever possible, be kept to a minimum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. The minister would be aware of recent suggestions that Australia's science and research base is being seriously eroded by a brain drain to overseas countries, as our leading scientists, engineers and technologists move offshore to pursue their professional interests. Can the minister inform the Senate whether there is any basis for these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2156" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen claims of this character. This is one of those urban myths. Indeed, in looking through the opposition's directional statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things that Matter</EMPHASIS>, it says under the heading of science and technology, `stop the brain drain of scientists from Australia.' Of course, the brain drain is a myth, and it has been a myth for a number of years. In reality, Australia has a brain gain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite the facts. Immigration data shows that in the 10-year period to 1992-93 Australia had a net influx of 28,000 engineers, scientists and academics in the science and engineering area and every year saw a net gain in these categories. The extent of this inflow can be measured by a comparison with the output of degree completions from Australian universities. The net influx is equivalent to about 18 per cent of all science and engineering degree completions in Australia for all of that period, that is, the equivalent of the annual graduate output of scientists and engineers from about eight average sized Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institution of Engineers has done some further work which confirms an influx of engineers into this country. Further, the immigrant scientists, engineers and academics tend to be people with some years of experience. They are not raw graduates; they tend to be experienced scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent anecdotal evidence shows that Australia has been one of the largest recipients of emigrating ex-Soviet scientists and engineers and, in fact, we could say that Australia is a site for international scientists to come to. But overall the impact is a net brain gain and not the illusion that the opposition has put abroad, that there is in this country a brain drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, some people might defend the ludicrous position of a brain drain by saying, `But we are losing quality people.' That is not true either. The normal pattern is for graduate Australians to go overseas for postgraduate work and come back, or to go overseas and find work and eventually return. Of course, not all of them come back, but the vast majority do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a number of eminent Australians who have sought work overseas, obtained it, come back to Australia and contributed to enrich our science and technology base in this country. They include Sir Mark Oliphant and Harry Messel; and I have a list here of some 16 or so other leading Australian scientists, including Sir Gustav Nossal, Michael Pitman, John Stocker, Colin Adam, and Roy Green&mdash;and the list goes on&mdash;all eminent Australian scientists who have gone overseas, worked and come back, and contributed their knowledge of international science to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important that Australians do travel abroad, so that Australia is locked into world scientific thought and debate, participate in breaking through the barriers in science elsewhere in the world and return to this country that body of corporate knowledge that enriches our scientific base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those opposite to claim in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a document that has slipped from public consciousness, I admit&mdash;that the first thing they will do is reverse the brain drain is to attack a straw man. There was a brain drain in this country when those opposite were in power. But would they please make an effort to keep up with modern developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said in here on a number of occasions, the Valentine report, which was commissioned by my portfolio, identified four major concerns essentially relating to the marine environment and the construction of the marina at Port Hinchinbrook. The report also identified lack of information as a major problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government is addressing the issue of inadequate information by undertaking two groups of baseline studies in the Hinchinbrook Channel area. The first group of studies are baseline studies adjacent to the project site and cover three aspects: a seagrass survey, water turbidity and water quality. The Commonwealth will be involved in the evaluation of the data that is produced by those studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of studies will survey the Hinchinbrook Channel and will examine the impact of the Oyster Point development in the context of other pressures on the channel. The Commonwealth, in relation to this study, will be participating in the design of the studies and the evaluation of the data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my advice to the Queensland government, I indicated that I support the program of environmental baseline studies of the area that are impacted by the proposed development works and that, if properly conducted, these studies should be adequate to address most of the concerns raised in the Valentine report about the lack of information. The results of the studies will be reviewed by my department and precise details on the process, the method and the timing for the evaluation of both groups of baseline studies are currently being determined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the whole problem with this development is the lack of a thorough environmental impact assessment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the government is very deeply shocked and saddened, as would be all Australians, by this latest act of terrorism, responsibility for which has been claimed by the Islamic extremist group Hamas. The attack, which the Israeli authorities believe to have been the work of a suicide bomber, as honourable senators would have seen in the press, has claimed the lives of 22 people and injured more than 40, at least four of them critically. As I said in this place on Monday, Australia obviously condemns terrorism in whatever form it occurs. This recent outrage is no exception. We condemn in the strongest possible terms those responsible for this criminal act which has resulted in the loss of so many innocent lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have today sent a message to my Israeli colleague, foreign minister Shimon Peres, expressing on behalf of the government and the people of Australia our profound condolences to the injured and the families of the victims. Despite the shadow which the bombing of the bus and other recent acts of violence have cast over the peace accords which Israel has reached with the Palestinians and, more recently, with Jordan, we do believe that such setbacks will not succeed in reversing the process towards peace. It is clear that there is broad recognition among the leaders of the Middle East that terrorism must not be permitted to affect the direction and momentum of the peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the fact that PLO chairman, Yasser Arafat, has unequivocally condemned the bombing and affirmed that the only response to what he has called `the enemies of peace' is to proceed with the negotiations. We welcome the fact that Israel has also confirmed that its negotiations with the PLO on extending Palestinian self-rule, including modalities for the election of a Palestinian Council, will not be disrupted although the talks have been temporarily adjourned by mutual agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the fact that Jordanian leaders have condemned the attack and affirmed their view that it would not defeat the peace process, and that Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, has also condemned the bombing. We applaud the resolve of the countries of the Middle East to press ahead with their task of creating a new political and economic reality in the region, undeterred by the threat of terrorism. The agreement to be signed next week by Israel and Jordan, coupled with the progress the Palestinians have made towards self-government, places the region on the threshold of a new era of peace, stability and economic prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain confident that despite the complexities of the Israel-Syria negotiating track, President Assad will not retreat from the strategic decision he has made to make peace with Israel. Despite such deplorable attacks as yesterday's bombing, Australia urges the governments and peoples of the region not to lose sight of the goal of a comprehensive peace settlement, which is now almost within reach. The alternative to peace can only be descent into a perpetual cycle of violence, the horrendous nature of which was demonstrated again so graphically yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since ERIN was established five years ago the service has developed dramatically, not only achieving local and national recognition but also receiving international accolades. The ERIN databases are designed to store and constantly update information on a whole range of Australian environmental issues, from climate to endangered species, from land management to information on government programs. It even provides a list of useful contacts and select bibliographies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The service is designed to provide up-to-date environmental information to people who undertake environmental planning and decisions making tasks. The idea is that all relevant environmental information collected or obtained by any Commonwealth agency can be added to the ERIN system, allowing an enormous number of users to access an ever-growing range of data. It is just commonsense that scientists, educators, researchers, managers, concerned citizens&mdash;in fact, everyone&mdash;should learn to share as much information that is available. Knowledge in this arena is of no use unless it is shared knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new ERIN on-line service&mdash;or EOS as it is called&mdash;which I launched yesterday, uses the latest multimedia technology to make information on ERIN's databases readily accessible to anyone who wants to use it&mdash;from school students to research scientists. The service combines database, graphics, analysis and networking technology which allows both general and specific information to be accessed extremely easily, and in a way that I think is both informative and interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now more than ever Australians will have the information that will enable them to contribute to the environmental debate; a debate which is central to our future as a nation and to the global community as well. At the launch of the Commonwealth cultural policy on Tuesday, the Prime Minister again highlighted how important it is that Australia be at the cutting edge in the development of the international information super highway. As he said last month, building the information highway is important but inventing the things that go on it is more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EOS is a superb example of the type and quality of information that the super highway should include. The EOS will be available on the Internet and Australia's Aarnet, making ERIN a truly international shared resource. A quality information technology product is only as good as the quality of the information and research behind it. There is no doubt about the high calibre of scientific knowledge about the Australian environment. Our approaches, findings and solutions have global applications.</PARA>

Is the minister aware of today's press reports that the Minister for Consumer Affairs will dump the government's origin labelling legislation rather than accept amendments from the coalition and the Democrats&mdash;despite comments from the ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, that the ACTU `is concerned about the inadequacy of the government's legislation and its major thrust'; despite public statements from great Australian food processors like SPC `that government legislation was a misguided approach' and Golden Circle's `concern at the use of the "made in Australia" label'; and despite the NFF's concern that `"made in Australia" should only be used to describe goods manufactured in Australia from Australian ingredients'? Will the minister give an assurance that she will not withdraw the legislation and act against the wishes of the ACTU, Australian workers, farmers, processors and consumers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the article because Senator Boswell has just passed it across the chamber to me. I thank him for that. The government has made no decision as to withdrawing the legislation, and that is essentially our current position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I can understand the frustration that Mrs McHugh, the Minister for Consumer Affairs, may be experiencing at the moment. Not only is she introducing legislation which encompasses the internationally accepted definition of `made in', but she has also had problems trying to work out where the opposition is coming from. It was only a few months ago that what Senator Boswell is now proposing&mdash;the interchange between `made in' and `manufactured in'&mdash;was rejected by those opposite. The minority report of Senator Vanstone called the proposal that Senator Boswell is advancing both `confusing' and `senseless'. Given that backdrop, given the complexity of the issues, and given the fact that the opposition has not worked it out&mdash;maybe Senator Boswell is the lone cavalier on this&mdash;I can understand why Mrs McHugh is experiencing frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, my understanding is that the definition that Senator Vanstone understood, that Mrs McHugh has introduced and which the government has embodied in this legislation is one which is recognised internationally. It has that advantage as well. So, despite the array of people that Senator Boswell has mentioned, I put it to him that maybe his side has to work out its position as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I did not read the article in the Beijing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Evening News</EMPHASIS>. As I informed the Senate on 19 September, it is unfortunate that FINA, the international swimming federation, has not yet been as willing as other international sporting bodies to work with ASDA and its international colleagues. I am pleased to say that since that time, and following pressure from agencies such as ASDA, FINA has requested information from ASDA about its out-of-competition testing services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this latest request, it is important that the pressure on FINA to take responsibility for dealing with the issue of drugs in sport is maintained. I have written to the president of FINA expressing my concerns on this matter. I have also written to my colleagues in Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and France, which are partners in our multilateral anti-doping agreement, who also might be keen to contact FINA on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the World Swimming Championships are to be held in Perth in 1998, we have a double opportunity to ensure that FINA adopts policies and programs that ensure that swimming is drug free. The drug testing procedures for the 2000 Olympic Games will be formally set by the International Olympic Committee. There is no doubt that the Sydney organising committee for the Olympic Games will be able to comply with the procedures that are likely to be set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we already have the most stringent drug testing program in the world. The Australian Sports Drug Agency and the accredited laboratory in Sydney played a key role in developing the drug aspects of the bid document that was submitted to the IOC. There will be 15,000 athletes at the Sydney games and I can give no undertaking that they will be entirely drug free. However, I will be actively encouraging international competition involving `clean' athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give an undertaking that we will apply the most stringent test procedures available to catch anyone who tries to cheat. I think we have built up a reputation as world leaders in the fight against performance enhancing drugs. Coupled with the spotlight that is going to be on Australia in the year 2000 Olympics, I think it gives us a unique chance to address these problems in the international arena. I also undertake that over the next six years we will work actively in international sporting arenas to ensure that other countries, other international sporting federations and multinational agencies such as the IOC, do take this issue seriously and take a comprehensive approach to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the 15,000 competitors will come to Australia at least once between 1996 and 2000, both for training and for acclimatisation. In addition, there will be a host of world championships and other international competitions held in Australia in the lead-up to the Olympics. These athletes will be exposed to ASDA's out-of-competition testing program and to its range of educational materials. I agree that the final part of the honourable senator's question is a very important issue. It is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed by world sporting bodies, including FINA.</PARA>

But are we getting somewhere near the day when those countries that have signed will simply say they will not take part in meets or championships at which there are obviously athletes who are not being drug tested, particularly out-of-competition drug tested?

Only 56 per cent of funds are allocated to production research, whereas processing research now takes up 18 per cent; product handling research, five per cent; and storage distribution and market research, six per cent.</PARA>

They are: enhancing the competitiveness and resilience of industries; developing a significant processing capacity to build on our comparative advantages; the development of industries oriented towards the demands of the marketplace, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region; management of the natural resource base in an ecologically sustainable manner; and an integrated response to regional development and adjustment.</PARA>

Is it true that these patches will potentially help thousands of smokers quit smoking and that, without PBS subsidisation, they will be out of the reach of many lower income earners, who will then be more likely to die of heart disease and cancer? Is it true that the real cost of the restrictive listing recommended is around $20 million, not the wildly inaccurate $100 million, and that there are potential savings in the health and financial areas which are enormous?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Immigration Review Tribunal Appointments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process for appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal is one consistent with appointments to other similar Government tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Minister responsible, I make the decision on appointments before taking my recommendations to Cabinet, and then to the Governor General for a final decision. This is the procedure embraced by Section 395 of the Migration Act 1958. This procedure is standard practice for appointments to tribunals and courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This system, as it relates to the review of migration decisions, was recently reviewed by the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Immigration Decisions (CROSROMD), chaired by the former Coalition Immigration Minister, Ian Macphee. The Committee consisted of Mr Macphee; Professor Julian Disney, Centre for International Public Law, Australian National University; Mr Stephen Skehill, Deputy Secretary, Department of the Attorney General; Ms Pamela O'Neil, Principal Member of the IRT; and Mr Wayne Gibbons, Deputy Secretary, Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It reported on December 11, 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This committee acknowledged and endorsed this power and responsibility of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It stated, in Recommendation 33(1):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister should continue to be responsible for recommending appropriate persons for appointment to the IRT by the Governor General in Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also endorsed the principle that the Tribunal should reflect a diversity of skills. This principle was stated by former Immigration Minister, Robert Ray, when he established the IRT in 1989. Again, it was restated by the Macphee Committee in Recommendation 7.9.1:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that immigration issues commonly involve difficult assessments of an applicant's personality, capabilities and motivations and consideration of cultural and other social factors. Consequently this is an area in which it is especially important for a wide range of experiences and perspectives to be present within a review authority in order to increase the prospect of arriving at well-informed and balanced decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to process, the Macphee committee recommended that the Minister should appoint an advisory committee to provide information on the applicants under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in doing so, it clearly stated that the Minister should not be bound by the committee's advice but should remain entitled to use his or her discretion when making final decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 33 (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister should remain entitled, however, to use additional methods, for identifying suitable candidates for appointment and should not be bound to accept the advisory committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I informed the Senate, in the most recent round of appointments announced on 17 August 1994, I set up a panel and asked it to assist with appointments in Victoria. I also asked it to assist with the other "high volume" States&mdash;New South Wales and Queensland. I asked it to provide me with further information as to the applicants in those States. In the smaller States, where a limited number of appointments were required, I decided I did not need the panel's assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The panel provided me with information on a list of people that it had considered in the three major States. The list included one person who was not interviewed&mdash;Ms Radford (NSW), a person with a distinguished career as a Federal public servant and who was working overseas. A positive assessment was made by the panel on Ms Radford's papers. Mr Karas, the incumbent Senior Member in Queensland, was also reappointed without an interview.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that all appointees made applications through the normal process. In States where I asked the panel to conduct interviews, only one part-time appointment was made without the panel's positive assessment. In NSW, only one person was assessed positively and not appointed. In Victoria, only two were assessed positively and not appointed, because of the limited number of positions. Michael Clothier was not one of these two.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve a panel which could best advise me on the exercise of my discretion, I drew on the three most relevant areas. The panel consisted of the Principal Member of the IRT, a senior departmental officer, and one of my staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The senior departmental officer who I appointed, Nick Nicholls, is head of the personnel branch of the Department and was the acting head of the Department's legal branch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Pamela O'Neil has been the Principal Member of the IRT since its establishment in 1989. She was congratulated on her appointment at that time by the Federal Opposition, particularly by Senator Chris Puplick.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the appointments are totally within my discretion, the inclusion of a member of my staff on the panel was both desirable and appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above, I did not ask the panel to interview in South Australia, Western Australia and the ACT, due to the smaller number of positions available, and the more limited response from applicants. I made recommendations for appointments and reappointments in these States on the material before me, as is quite common with such appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These appointments were made on the basis of the person's experience, qualifications and perspectives, in accordance with the recommendations of the Macphee committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is evident, the discretion in all tribunal appointments is mine and I fail to see how it is possible for me to politically interfere with my own decisions! I have however, in the appointments, ensured the selection of talented, independent persons as I did with recent Refugee Review Tribunal appointments.</PARA>

<PARA>At least now I do have something to talk about. It was pretty obvious from question time generally that none of the ministers was able to answer any questions except those that were dorothy dixers prepared by themselves and distributed to their own backbench. It really shows the absolute contempt with which the current government treats this parliament and treats question time. It is supposed to be a time when the opposition can obtain information, but the ministers simply do not care or are not sufficiently briefed, or do not wish to be put under scrutiny at question time. One minister after the other was simply unable to answer questions put by the Liberal and National parties that were very much matters of great public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has given a sort of answer&mdash;after question time, regrettably. He indicates that this is an internal working document. It does not seem to be too internal; there seem to be plenty of copies floating around. But it is a proposal dated September 1994, and it is one that I would have thought Senator Collins would have been aware of. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Collins used to be the transport minister and he has represented the transport minister at estimates committees on this side of the parliamentary building since he lost the transport portfolio. His answer to me today was similar to his attitude during estimates committees, that is, that he did everything possible to protect the CAA, to keep it from parliamentary scrutiny and to stonewall every question that tried to raise the issues that have become so current in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps if Senator Collins had been a little more interested in the parliamentary scrutiny, if he had allowed some of my questions and those of my colleagues to go through to the CAA, some of the tragedies that we have seen in recent times may not have happened. Senator Collins's answer today again shows that he wants to avoid these questions&mdash;questions that we raise which relate to the safety of air transport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper to which I have drawn attention proposes quite dramatic cuts to safety at airports around Australia. In Sydney, the proposal is to reduce the staff allocation from 68 to 62, which is almost a 10 per cent cut in the firefighting service at Sydney. In Cairns, at an airport in North Queensland which I use quite often, the proposal is to cut the staff allocation from 69 to 63, again a cut of around nine <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worse in Launceston where the proposal is to cut the firefighting rescue service from 28 to 21; that is by seven, or almost 33 per cent of the existing personnel. Senators could imagine what that will do for safety at Launceston airport. Similarly in Hobart there is a reduction from 29 to 23 and of concern to me as well, as a Queensland senator, is the proposal to reduce the Rockhampton service and the Mackay service from 15 to 10, representing cuts of 33 per cent in the firefighting service at those airports. With these sorts of services, there is a limit below which one cannot go and still have an effective rescue firefighting service at these airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that some of these airports are not as busy as others does not mean to say that the effort needed in the event of an emergency is not the same, whether it be a big or small airport. The way the CAA is proposing to slash the numbers of safety personnel in these regional airports particularly, but also at Sydney, shows that it has not learnt the lesson and is more intent on saving money than on saving lives. I hope that by raising that matter in the parliament, we can stop dead this proposal by the CAA to lower yet further the safety aspects of flying in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The question I asked during question time was why the onus was on employers to verify the accuracy of the jobstart canvassing card which is provided by the CES. The minister subsequently said that the onus has to be on the employees and that the jobstart card is not worth anything in terms of going and getting a job and obtaining a subsidy. Then why on earth have it? Many jobstart cards issued after the release of the government's Working Nation white paper are not worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was advised by the very same minister that all CES officers were notified immediately after the release of the white paper on 4 May about the reduction in the jobstart subsidy rate and were told that the changes would come into effect on 4 July. A constituent of mine was issued with a card on 3 June, one month later; and that card stated that it was valid for three months from 3 June 1994 to 3 September 1994. The details on the card stipulated that she may be eligible for a subsidy of $200 per week for 16 weeks. That simply was not right&mdash;and the CES had provided that card one month after the Working Nation statement was brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staff of the CES continued up to the changeover date to complete cards for their clients which advised potential employers that the cardholder may be eligible for the old higher rate of $200 per week for 16 weeks; and the card was valid for three months from the date of issue. There was no directive to notify employers or jobstart clients prior to the changes taking effect. Surely some responsibility should be put on the CES rather than that all the responsibility should be put onto the employers or the unemployed. After all, it is the unemployed who are desperately trying to seek work&mdash;and many companies are equally desperate to try to provide work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES&mdash;or, more importantly, the government&mdash;is abrogating its responsibility. This has given a number of employers a very false impression and jeopardised the possible employment of a number of long-term unemployed people. The minister simply washes his hands of the responsibility for these people by saying that the advice given on the jobstart card does not commit the Commonwealth to a particular level of subsidy. The simple question is, `Why give the card in the first place?' I believe it is quite unfair, especially when the CES was aware that changes were imminent. There should have been an amendment to cards issued after the details of the changes were released to CES staff to notify the client and the potential employer that the old subsidy would end on 4 July and that a lower subsidy of $100 per week, half the subsidy for three weeks less&mdash;$100 a week for 13 weeks&mdash;would take its place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, cardholders who received cards prior to 4 May should have received written advice of the change. It should not be the responsibility of potential employers to verify every jobstart client's cards if the client is considered to be a prospective employee. Rather, it is the responsibility of the CES to provide up-to-date and accurate information about its programs in advance of the forthcoming changes to those programs. The difference in the subsidy, quite frankly, can be the difference between an employer being able to afford someone and not. And here we are giving the unemployed a card that quite clearly is stating the wrong information!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be also looked at is the emotional aspect of this. It has been heartbreaking for this particular constituent and for many others who obviously have experienced the same problem. It is heartbreaking for those jobstart clients to come within an absolute whisker of getting a job only to find that the information they have been provided with by the CES and have subsequently given to a prospective employer is wrong. It is unsatisfactory that the government takes such an indifferent and careless attitude to the long-term unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer to Senator Collins's non-answer to my question, which I believe is a disgrace, considering the number of air crashes we have had in recent weeks. On 1 August this year a Melbourne doctor wrote to the regional manager of the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;with a copy to the minister responsible for Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Brereton&mdash;in which he outlined a whole lot of problems that he had encountered in flying out of Broome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a few examples. He pointed out that when the petrol switch was on, it was actually off; there was extreme vibration on take off which the pilot said was called `shimming'; the fuel gauge suddenly flicked to zero on one of the petrol tanks and the pilot had to furtively chase around and switch tanks; the pilot then informed the doctor that the reason the plane was flying so slowly was that she could not get the wheels up; she then said that they had to return to Broome, or to some other suitable airport, because she was concerned for the safety of the passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor had a lot of praise for the pilot. He said there was nothing wrong with her. When the plane landed it was met by fire engines at the airstrip and they had to look out the window to see if the wheels were locked down. The doctor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that it will not be long before there is a major disaster with this airline.</PARA>
<PARA>On receipt of a copy of that letter, I wrote to General Gration, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. The doctor received a response to his letter from Captain Rick Davies. The doctor points out that it seemed to be a very reasonable response. Captain Davies wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complaints that you raised were quite frankly merely the tip of a rather large iceberg; I am not yet in a position to give you the feedback that I indicated that I would.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our investigations are not yet complete. I will debrief you on what action we have taken when the matter is brought to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter was dated 26 September 1994. One has to wonder about the dating on that letter because subsequently Mr George Wood, the recipient of the original letter, wrote to the doctor as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to our letter of 4 August 1994&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As forecast by Captain Rick Davies, the Darwin District Office conducted an investigation into the matter and your triggering information was of great assistance in that exercise;</PARA>
<PARA>The question one has to ask is: why did the doctor have to trigger that investigation if the surveillance was being properly carried out. Obviously it was not. Why has the minister never even responded to the copy of the letter sent to him by the doctor. Mr George Wood of the CAA goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the outcome of that surveillance is a matter between this Authority and the operator I can say that your efforts have contributed in a very positive way to achieving a satisfactory level of safety.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was very concerned about the tone of the letter taken by George Wood. I would contend it is not a simple matter between King Leopold Air and Civil Aviation Authority but would rather regard this as a cover-up.</PARA>
<PARA>The bureaucratic language contained in the letter would make one feel that way if one were the recipient of the letter. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would appreciate if you could follow this matter up as I believe I have some right to know the outcome and to be reassured about the safety of King Leopold Air or the fact that it will not continue to fly.</PARA>
<PARA>He gives a perfectly responsible reason for this when he goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the particular reasons for the importance of this is that I have friends who live and work in the area and also friends who go up there as tourists.</PARA>

<PARA>In response to a very serious question that I asked about violations of human rights in East Timor and violations of human rights in Indonesia, the foreign minister of Australia got up in this chamber and, in a very dismissive way, suggested that these violations were in my own mind. The reason I felt it was urgent to get up and ask a question about this issue today was that the respected Bishop of Dili, Bishop Belo, had actually denounced the systematic program of sterilisation that is taking place in East Timor&mdash;not only in the capital city of Dili but also in such other towns as Vikeke and Suai. </PARA>

<PARA>I am sad to the say that the audit report does not bear that out. As I understand it, apparently the three tenant agencies in question were not entirely happy with the arrangements of higher rent with compensation through PAP. It seems that there is a glitch with PAP in that the subsidy rates are based on market rents which are several months old. At a time of falling rent, this meant the tenants felt that they could do a bit better out in the open market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turn, AEM kept them quiet by offering them a package worth $3.9 million, consisting of rent-free periods and free fit out. Such arrangements are referred to in the market as incentives. They were referred to as incentives in correspondence between APG and AEM. They were referred to as having the effect of incentives in correspondence between APG and ACS. They certainly are an inducement to the tenants to stay in the building at rents otherwise in excess of market rental, even with the shonky PAP subsidy. Yet on page 27 the report quotes the arguments from the AEM people and from DAS as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amounts were not incentives in the context of inducing the units to undertake something that would not have otherwise been undertaken but rather represented a package of financial benefits to the units for which they did not pay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank Senator Spindler for his contribution. I suspected many months ago that PAP and the dealings in Casselden Place were shonky. The Senate passed a resolution seeking these documents which would prove that the arrangements at Casselden Place were effectively creating a financial house of mirrors to cover up one of the biggest property disasters that have ever occurred in Australia, particularly in the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It occurred over a period of ministers. We will not give any blame to Senator Bolkus, because he arrived relatively late on the scene.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers who are responsible for what is indeed a cover-up&mdash;even though Senator Bolkus said there was no cover-up and scandal&mdash;are Mr Walker, in the other place, and Senator McMullan, who has the leave of this place today. There was a cover-up, because the Senate passed on two occasions&mdash;specifically on 5 May and again on 10 May&mdash;a return to order motion requiring that these documents be tabled. Those orders were entirely defied by these ministers. They told us, if I may paraphrase them, that everything was okay and they were all normal commercial arrangements. Mr Walker said in writing, and Senator McMullan said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, that no incentives were involved. This was quite clearly stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report now shows that on those two occasions both of those ministers grossly misled the parliament. They said that there were no incentives, and tens of millions of dollars worth of incentives have been paid. The Auditor-General reached a conclusion on the construction of this house of mirrors and all of the financial arrangements. I do not even think high-flying merchant bankers of the 1980s such as Mr Connell, or even entrepreneurs such as Mr Bond, could have come up with such an interesting scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum net result is that the Australian taxpayer has poured in excess of $103 million into this house of mirrors called Casselden Place. I am reminded of the debate we are having at the moment in the committee stage of the Aboriginal land fund bill. I thought Senator Chamarette might think of that. This government is pumping $21 million a year into its fantastic new justice package so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can buy land, and here it is pouring $103 million into its white man's land in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it is a minimum of $103 million because, quite frankly, if the government had sought to minimise its losses one, two or three years ago&mdash;or even up to a few months ago&mdash;instead of deciding to cover up this property scandal, it could still have saved the taxpayer probably tens of millions of dollars. If it had availed itself of literally hundreds of acres of empty modern office accommodation available to lease in Melbourne, it could have saved millions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report, which will be tabled in a short while, will confirm that the government has lost $103 million.

What we have here is the Australian Democrats&mdash;the party of `feel good, soft and cuddly and more to life than just financial management'&mdash;asking the Auditor-General to make an assessment of all these leases on the basis of one criterion alone, that is, financial effectiveness. What about social considerations? What about, for instance, in leases consideration of the fact that one may have to apply access and equity principles, social justice, child-care centres and occupational health and safety aspects? All of those things are ignored in this motion. What Senator Spindler wants to find out is where the bottom dollar goes and forget about the people. </PARA>

Does he know how many leases AEM is actually involved in? He would not know. But I can say to Senator Spindler that this could keep the Auditor-General going for a good century or so. This motion reflects the lack of consideration that Senator Spindler has applied to this motion. He has jumped. He thought, `Wonderful! I can get on the bandwagon as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I informed this house on 24 August 1994 of the objectives which the Australian delegation would be pursuing in Cairo at the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development, in response to a question from Senator Margaret Reynolds. I would now like to report to parliament on the outcome of that conference and draw attention to the part Australia played.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's paramount concern at Cairo was that consensus be achieved on a strong, forward looking document. This was important because of both the critical goals contained within the draft program of action and the importance we place on the United Nations process of consensus in advancing international reform. In fact, the agreement reached at Cairo has been a triumph for the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major themes of the conference had the potential to generate controversy&mdash;potential which was fulfilled&mdash;but there was also a strong possibility that the conference would split irreconcilably along north-south or religious lines. Such a split did not occur and Australia played its part in ensuring that agreement was reached on the widest possible range of issues and, just as importantly, that the program of action which emerged was indeed forward looking, that it built on, rather than withdrew from, previous agreements and that it could be placed clearly within the framework of internationally accepted human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major advances in thinking have now occurred since the earlier UN population conferences, in Bucharest in 1974 and Mexico City in 1984. The first is that population growth is seen as a global concern. The second is that population is no longer seen as a problem which can be tackled in isolation from social and economic conditions, particularly those which limit the power of women to control their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Australia's major objectives at Cairo was to promote agreement on strategies for empowering women, strategies to enable them to enjoy equally with men the full range of human rights. The program of action translates the principle of female empowerment into a range of practical actions involving: greater educational and employment opportunities for women and girls; making marriage an equal partnership; taking steps to protect women and girls from physical abuse and exploitation; and enabling women to participate fully in decision making at all levels of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action, in prescribing gender equality, calls on men to take greater responsibility for their actions and to assume an equal share in the raising of children. The document recognises the importance of families within society and urges governments to support them. It also acknowledges that there is variety in the forms which families may take. Australia, as a nation which accepts cultural diversity, was active in promoting this principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, some countries sought to limit the obligations under the program of action by seeking to place religious, ethical and cultural considerations on the same plane as national sovereignty and universally recognised international human rights. Australia was one of a number of countries which worked to preserve the balance between these considerations to ensure that human rights were not compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was also concerned to ensure that differences in views about contraception and abortion amongst member nations were not permitted to prevent agreement on strategies critical for addressing important issues of sexual and reproductive health. Although the Holy See and a small number of other states entered reservations in respect of chapters on sexual and reproductive health, wide agreement was nevertheless reached on a number of important new concepts in sexual and reproductive health encompassing not only physical wellbeing but also fulfilling human relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our major objectives was to achieve agreement on a program of action which would support the internationally agreed right of men and women to have the information and the means to determine the number and spacing of their children. Agreement was reached not only on the need to ensure the widest availability and choice in safe and acceptable family planning methods but also on the need for adolescents to have access to appropriate information, services and counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action enshrines the principles of freedom of choice and non-coercion in family planning programs but takes a strong position on making available the means to exercise that choice. It seeks to address problems such as the maternal and infant mortality associated with high risk pregnancy and to minimise both the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the need for abortion by making family planning and primary health care services as widely available as possible. For the first time, unsafe abortion and its consequences have been acknowledged as a major public health concern which governments are urged to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, there is now widespread recognition that, to be successful, population programs need to integrate development and family planning objectives, and to include strategies for addressing the social and economic disadvantage so often associated with high levels of population growth. The program of action adopts such an integrated approach and Australia was pleased to contribute to this conclusion through the independent inquiry into population and development, which was made available to other delegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action commits both donors and developing country governments to closing the gender gap which exists at every level of the education system in the developing world. There are 130 million eligible children who are not enrolled in primary school and 70 per cent of these are girls. Education is essential to the social development of countries and the dignity and wellbeing of their populations. Lack of education, particularly for girls, exacts a development cost in terms of lost opportunities to slow population growth, raise incomes, productivity and the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, improving basic education, particularly for girls, is not a simple task and it requires action in a wide range of sectors, including particular efforts in training teachers and strengthening institutions. Australia will be seeking to increase funding in the education sector. We have already significantly increased assistance to health and population programs. Our task will be to design effective, culturally appropriate assistance that consolidates the efforts already being made by developing country governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action recognises that significant additional resources will be required to translate the goals of Cairo into reality. The Australian government will be endeavouring to do its fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also agreement to allocate resources for broader reproductive health concerns in addition to family planning programs. They also include maternal health, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS, and basic actions for collecting and analysing population data. This approach is consistent with Australia's development assistance programs which focus on women's empowerment, their health and education as essential to population programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is important that population and development issues be pursued in concert, it is also important that governments develop policies which embody the principle of sustainability. Another important objective for the Australian delegation at Cairo was that of securing continued commitment to the principle that all economic activity, in developed and developing countries alike, should be environmentally sustainable. Australia was one of a small number of countries that pursued sustainable development issues consistently throughout the preparatory process and during the conference itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that the program of action builds on the international agreement reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. It does this by reiterating the importance of the concept of sustainability and strengthening language on the relationship between production, consumption and population. No less than five of the 15 principles adopted by the conference highlight the significance of sustainability in ensuring the future wellbeing of the world's population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of indigenous peoples are important in the context of a program of action which deals with development and population. At Cairo we argued for explicit recognition of the needs of indigenous peoples in the program of action, not just because they comprise marginalised and disadvantaged groups in many societies, including our own, but because as they are custodians of values which reflect a uniquely durable relationship with the environment. Indigenous peoples often have a cultural and spiritual attachment to the environment which goes beyond economics, and which could be threatened by unsustainable development and some forms of population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was very active at the preceding preparatory committee meetings in New York in strengthening references to indigenous peoples throughout the text. It also managed to have a principle on indigenous peoples accepted within the revised draft set of 15 principles considered in Cairo, despite the number of draft principles having been reduced from 33, none of which dealt with indigenous peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, along with many other nations, is now pleased that a principle was adopted in Cairo which calls on member nations to recognise and support the identity, culture and interests of indigenous peoples and to enable them to participate fully in the economic, political and social life of the country. The program of action also calls on governments to respect the cultures of indigenous peoples, to enable them to own and manage territories, protect and restore natural resources and ecosystems on which they depend and to take these into account when formulating national policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some difficult migration issues had to be addressed at the Cairo conference and it was important to achieve a balance between the need for national sovereignty, and recognition of the needs of refugees and migrants and the contribution that they can make. One issue that emerged with unexpected force in Cairo was the question of the right of family reunion. Few countries have recognised the benefits and desirability of family migration more than Australia. However, Australia and many other countries including the other traditional countries of migration, were not prepared to concede a right, particularly when its application to family groups was uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was happy to be able to play a key role in brokering a solution calling on countries to recognise the value of family reunion and to reflect it in their legislation, as we have done in Australia, and which refers to Article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This requires member nations to deal humanely and expeditiously with applications for family reunion between parents and children and to respect the right of exit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn briefly to the future. Member nations are committed to regularly assessing their progress towards implementation of the program of action and reporting on a periodic basis. Many of the goals set out within the program are ones to which Australia has already given high priority and the targets are more than met. In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to position itself early in ensuring that it meets, or more than meets, the objectives of the program of action. I have therefore initiated a detailed examination of the program of action. I would expect to make further statements on the results of this review early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record my appreciation of all those who contributed to Australia's success at Cairo particularly Ambassador Butler, Richard Woolcott, parliamentary members of the delegation, officials from government agencies, representatives of non-government organisations and particularly my colleagues from this place, Senators Reynolds, Bourne and Harradine for their interest in going to Cairo and participating in the discussions there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conference was basically premised on an acceptance that high world population growth as it is is harmful to world development, and that one of the ways to improve human wellbeing is to limit or restrict the rate of world population growth. It is worth noting, and I make this as an observation, that whilst Senator Bolkus and the Australian government agreed with this premise in a global sense, as I understand it, they specifically rejected it in a national Australian sense. That is, they rejected limiting Australia's population growth and the concept that such growth inhibits rising living standards in countries such as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

There were shifting sands, obviously, as the conference went on. Senator Bolkus weighed into this debate by criticising the Catholic church over its pro-life stance by saying that its insistence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would not only cause human misery but would challenge the very commitment to humanity which forms an essential part of all such faiths.</PARA>
<PARA>If we do not, as a society, take an essentially positive pro-life approach to humanity and society, then I really wonder where our society in a civilised world will go. I think that is a matter of very grave concern. I know others will comment on that.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Time</EMPHASIS> magazine summed up the conference outcome as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More power to women, fewer mouths to feed&mdash;the UN conference reaches consensus: gender equality is a key to curbing population growth.</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, no country at Cairo voted against the final draft position, although, as the minister pointed out in his statement today, the Holy See and a small number of other states entered reservations in respect of the chapters on sexual and reproductive health. The final position was one which emphasises individual human rights. It seeks, as the minister said, to empower women by better education, access to health care, and greater equality under the law in all societies&mdash;aspects with which the coalition would agree. The stress on education was also a very important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report calls for governments to commit $17 billion by the year 2000 to curbing population growth. I will be very interested to hear just how much this government has committed Australia towards contributing, particularly when I note that the government claims to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . have more than trebled the resources it devotes to international assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister's statement is notably vague on this commitment so far as Australia is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While broadly accepting the conclusions of the conference as practical and constructive, I am concerned about the relative lack of attention that was paid to the development side of the conference. For instance, what weight was brought to bear on those undemocratic regimes around the world which suppress their people, and which were importantly represented at the conference? What direction was spelt out for opening up undeveloped and developing nations to investment and economic advancement? Those equally, if not more, important areas for improving the wellbeing of our fellow world inhabitants are left to forums like GATT and others when troubles arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been very helpful, to say the least, if the conference had expressed unanimous support for guaranteeing universal freedoms and liberties&mdash;social, political and economic. I hope that the next world conference on population and development will pay attention to these matters because they go to the very heart of the liberty and wellbeing of people. After all, population is all about people. It cannot reasonably be claimed, in my view, that these issues are irrelevant in such a conference. The wellbeing of people in the broadest sense should be at the centre of our international attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I would like to remind the Senate very briefly of the coalition's broad policy position on international population and development issues as enunciated by successive coalition foreign affairs spokesmen. We support measures fundamental to the alleviation of hunger, poverty and environmental degradation. We support Australia's ongoing overseas aid contributions to these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that some of the best international work on the relationship between population, development and environment is being done by international organisations like the World Health Organisation and UNICEF. These agencies often also draw on the knowledge and assistance of Australians in the biomedical, social science, demographic, scientific and medical fields. Some of the programs aim at reducing maternal and infant mortality, reproductive health issues and nutrition. The coalition also supports actions that facilitate voluntary access to safe family planning as an essential aspect in meeting global human development needs, especially improved health for women and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that one of the best ways to discourage unsafe and harmful practices is to provide these voluntary programs but we are categorically opposed to any form of coercion in family planning issues, whether in terms of the methods used or in attempting to adhere to government targets, as may be the case for example in the People's Republic of China. As a coalition, we would certainly ensure that no Australian aid, either directly or indirectly, is used for these latter unacceptable purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also fully supportive of international measures to increase education, housing and employment opportunities for the less fortunate, consistent with development and environment aims.

Let me say that the Coalition supports the Government's approach at the Conference&mdash;an approach similar to that of many other countries&mdash;that while we recognise the benefits and desirability of family migration, we cannot concede it as an automatic right. I would stress however, that the Coalition remains strongly committed to family reunion and to humanitarian assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that we do not have very much time left in this debate so I apologise to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> beforehand if I should speak rather quickly. However, I have very copious notes which can be referred to. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I am pleased to express our full support for the contents of the program of action which was tabled today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). I was fortunate to have attended, as a member of the Australian delegation, the United Nations Conference on Population and Development which took place in September this year in Cairo. I was particularly fortunate because those of us who went were afforded a rare opportunity to meet and discuss with a wide range of groups and individuals from around the world the increasingly important and interrelated issues of population, development, the environment, human needs and social responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a world population presently around 5.7 billion and increasing at a rate of over one billion per decade, the international community had an almost overwhelming task of putting in place a program of action which would genuinely address these issues. One of the more startling statistics quoted by United States Vice-President Gore was that it took 10,000 generations to reach a population of two billion; and two more generations to double that figure. Across the whole spectrum of participants from national governments in the developed and developing world alike, to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and to smaller non-government organisations, there was a general acceptance that without global efforts to slow population growth, science and technology would not be able to redeem the future from poverty and hunger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the conference owes much to the efforts of one woman in particular, Dr Nafis Sadik, General Secretary of the United Nations Population Fund. Dr Sadik is an extraordinary woman whose vision and personal energy are inspiring. It was largely because of her exceptional efforts that so much was achieved in Cairo. On the whole, the program of action is a realistic plan which, if acted upon, should effectively address the population and development challenges the world now faces. It is especially reassuring to find that the issue of what form of development we pursue is given serious attention in the program of action. This is one of the most vital issues the world faces in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real threat of course is the overconsumption patterns of the industrialised world&mdash;and that includes Australia. One of the more startling statistics given great emphasis in Cairo is that even though the industrialised world makes up only 22 per cent of the world's population, it consumes two-thirds of all resources and generates 75 per cent of all pollutants and wastes. So the issues for us in Cairo were much more complicated than a mere desire to bring world population numbers into a suitable balance in accordance with nature's capacity to cope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the need to address the runaway consumption of resources in the industrialised world and the development patterns that nations pursue. Population by itself is not the problem; rather it is the balance between population and resources. It is the unequal and the uncontrolled use of energy resources that makes life unsustainable. The program of action correctly recognises that the way we use resources in the environment has significant implications in terms of population policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serious attention was also given in Cairo to the importance of integrating women into all future development activities, in order to meet population and development challenges. Women as heads of households, as educators and, particularly in the developing world, as the majority of the world's farmers&mdash;a fact often overlooked&mdash;have enormous potential to reverse the process of environmental damage and to limit population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is crucial that governments adopt the recommendations contained in the program of action which are based on the principle that successful population programs target the role of women in both the decision-making and implementation programs. Poverty and the low status of women are among the primary causes of rapid population growth and environmental degradation. Women are particularly dependent on children for economic security and thus they often feel forced not to limit their families, even though they might otherwise wish to do so. Rural women, in particular, are often forced to adopt environmentally destructive practices in their daily struggle just to survive&mdash;for example in such things as firewood collection. The world's poorest people have the least ability to engage in alternative economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these interconnecting issues of poverty, overpopulation and environmental degradation, this Cairo program of action has successfully focused on the need to empower women and to provide women with the necessary resources through technology, training and education. Australia has an enormous responsibility to now ensure that our aid projects give increasing emphasis to women's issues and in particular to empowering women. I trust that the government will move to recognise this in next year's overseas aid budget. In particular, this will require substantial increases in the funding provided to family planning, health and education activities for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats welcome the government's commitment to promoting non-coercive population polices as part of Australia's various overseas aid projects. One aspect of the program of action relating to family planning that deserves special mention is the recognition that it is just as important to include men in such projects as it is to include women. As the program of action makes clear, increasing men's responsibility for family planning increases the chances for success of all such programs. The twin objectives of empowering women and enlightening men to act on their responsibilities will lead to tangible results in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the program of action which we thoroughly welcome is the principles relating to the special roles and needs of indigenous peoples. The recognition which is afforded to indigenous identity, contributions and requirements represents a welcome progression in the international community's identification of the role of indigenous peoples. This is especially so because there was wide acceptance of the view in Cairo that indigenous peoples are generally among the most disadvantaged in the world today&mdash;and they deserve very special attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me, I would like to mention my fellow members of the Australian delegation, all of whom very obviously were committed to achieving the best possible outcome and were prepared to work very hard and for very long hours to accomplish that goal. The atmosphere at such conferences is always tense and is usually quite difficult. To the credit of all members of the delegation, we were able to work together to achieve the best possible results under considerable pressure. I thank the minister for allowing me to be part of the delegation and I thank all the other members of the delegation.</PARA>

Debates on any subject at United Nations conferences can appear to be rather protracted. One can see that there is a lot of rhetoric. One can ask where all this is leading. The conference, in my opinion, was very positive. It certainly has put firmly on the agenda the question of empowerment of women and the issue of women's reproductive rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In relation to the need for a focus on resource mobilisation, I think it is true that a number of us felt that more might have been achieved in getting absolute commitment from many nations in regard to resource allocation. What influenced this was the fact that the United Nations Social Development Summit is to be held in Copenhagen next March, and it was opportune for some countries to argue that this question of resource allocation in relation to the development issues should be included in that debate rather than finalised at Cairo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by focusing specifically on the resource mobilisation issues. We were all impressed with the delegate from Ghana, who said that we must curb the appetite of the developed world, which has become bloated from overconsumption. When we talk of population and development, we must remind ourselves of the inequities not only between north and south and between nations but within nations. The quality and success of population and development programs depend to a considerable extent on how strategically a country allocates its resources among various sectors. This, in turn, depends on the social, political, economic and cultural realities of the country and its population policy and program priorities. Parliamentarians attending a forum prior to the population and development conference which I had the opportunity to attend said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the responsibility as elected representatives of the people to translate public support for population and development activities into the most beneficial distribution of budgetary, human and administrative resources. We take note of the strong international consensus on the need to mobilize significant domestic and external financial resources and endorse the estimated resource requirements set forth in the draft Programme of Action. Additional resources to population and development programmes should be made available by shifting resources, especially from defense expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore pledge to work to enact legislation to increase domestic funding for population and development programmes, as appropriate, and call upon the international community to provide the resources required to implement activities . . . At the same time, efficient use of existing resources is also important and should be pursued through such measures as decentralization, peoples' participation, a focus on target groups and an increase of national capacities.</PARA>
<PARA>I found that one of the very interesting features of the parliamentarians forum was the call to action. In relation to United Nations agendas, I think it is important to recognise that there is not only a government role but also a parliamentary role. The Australian government has recognised this on a couple of occasions by including parliamentarians in delegations. I think this is a practice that should be more widely adopted by many countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Program of Action is to be implemented to match the rhetoric that we all heard during the debate at Cairo, it will take parliamentarians across the political spectrum to closely monitor the activities of all governments to ensure that they always practice what they preach. It is very easy for countries to send along key government spokespeople to say what they believe should be the case in terms of a program, but it is what happens when we return to our respective countries that is important. Therefore, I would like to read a part of a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Call to Action</EMPHASIS>, which is from 300 parliamentarians attending the special preparatory conference prior to Cairo. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given our role in the civil society as representatives of people, we parliamentarians are uniquely placed to implement the ICDP Programme of Action, as adopted at Cairo, at the national and subnational level and to introduce a new concern for the planet and for humankind for the pursuit of national policies of our governments. We call on parliamentarians everywhere to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;enact legislation to enable Governments to formulate and implement national population policies and programmes specifically, improvement of the legal, social, economic and cultural status of women;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;appeal to Governments which have not done so to sign the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women . . .</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;promote the active participation of local governments, community groups and non-governmental organizations, especially women's groups, in implementing the Programme of Action as adopted . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I commend one of the first actions that has been taken as a result, and that is an initiative of Minister Carmen Lawrence, who has initiated a family planning review in Australia headed by Murray Coleman.

They worked under very difficult conditions and very long hours, and we were very appreciative of their help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to the conference as a delegate in the hope that, by so doing, the draft declaration could be improved. I had studied the draft declaration prior to going there and had identified five or six particular areas which I felt required improvement. That improvement could well have been adopted. In the ultimate, I attempted day after day to raise those particular issues within the delegation, and some sort of excuse was always given that these matters could not be discussed at the particular time I raised them. The issues I wanted to raise related to human rights abuses in population programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there are target driven programs they are inherently coercive. My concern with the views that were being expressed was that the document should contain something more than just a simple statement about coercion. I believe that the declarations in the document about non-coercion required enforcement, and that such enforcement requires sanctions of those contravening human rights. Very often we will hear a country say, `We are not coercive. This is the work of some of the family planning workers and cadres that are over-enthusiastic'. We see gross violations of human rights&mdash;particularly women's rights. If we ask, `Can we visit these people in jail? How much are their fines?', we are told, `No, definitely not'. These people are allowed to do what they like. We need sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was attempting to have included in the document the provisions that member countries should ensure that criminal sanctions, including imprisonment and fines, are applied against persons who induce participation in family planning and population programs by applying coercion, whether psychological, physical or economic, or who misrepresent the nature and effect of the birth control devices or drugs being supplied, or fail to ensure the free and informed consent of program participants. I do not have the time to go into it now, but there should be disciplinary action. Population programs found to have contained involuntary measures should not be funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter related to consumer protection. I believe that member countries should ensure, by domestic legislation, that all population family planning should include an earmarked funding measure, separately administered by independent consumer protection and legal aid bodies to guarantee that recipients of birth control drugs and devices are properly and fully informed of health risks or side effects, and that legal aid is available to individuals and consumer groups to enable them to exercise their rights to due and impartial judicial process where any harm or damage from birth control drugs or devices is alleged. I can give honourable senators information on the consumer protection aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of development, the government had been saying that the Ahlburg report was to be used in Cairo as a guide. The Ahlburg report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government seeks to improve the economic position of the poor, the largest and quickest impact will come from the most direct policy instruments available. Among such instruments are policies to increase access of the poor to land, credit, public infrastructure, and services, particularly, education and health.</PARA>
<PARA>I tried to raise these matters in the delegation day after day after day. I also tried to raise the question of finance. A draft program&mdash;which was finally endorsed; pretty quickly, I might add&mdash;required US$17 billion by the year 2000, US$18.5 billion by the year 2005 and US$20.5 billion by the year 2010. As far as Australia is concerned, in addition to the threefold increase in that area now, it would translate to a further threefold increase by the year 2000 and over fourfold by the year 2015. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is taxpayer money. I was trying to assess how this was devised. I knew there had been meetings. I had seen documentation of meetings of people who would largely be beneficiaries of this huge amount of money. I also knew that our delegation brief was such that we did not favour the approach to resources in the Cairo document. I kept asking, `When are we to examine that matter?'. As a member of parliament, I believe that I had a responsibility to do that because it involved taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Wednesday, I had been to the NGO forum where  women from a number of countries were giving evidence to a tribunal hearing evidence on the dramatic effect of birth control drugs and devices. It almost made the tears come to my eyes. On the Wednesday afternoon I went back and said, `When are we going to discuss this?' Ambassador Butler said, `It will have to be later on. We really do not know how the program will proceed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was too much for me and I made a bit of a scene. Subsequently, we had a discussion about what I had been trying to bring up. The ambassador undertook to see a number of delegations. Later he reported that he was not able to get support for the proposition. I asked him what delegations he had seen and could I speak to them. He refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came away from the meeting feeling that it had been a waste of time because I believe that members of parliament were not able to express properly thought out views, particularly on matters which dealt with finance. That was a crucial question. I was extremely disappointed. I believe that these meetings should be open to any member of parliament who wants to go. The government did not pay for my expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is running short, but I want to say two more things. Tensions did occur amongst the Third World delegates. Only  seven pages out of 114 pages were devoted to development. Development was nearly ignored. Tensions did emerge. The minister may not have heard them, but if he had been there on Saturday afternoon and evening he would have heard them. The tension exploded over the issue of family reunion migration. That was an issue where the delegates let off steam because they were concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the problems with this report are directly attributable to the terms of reference of the report. This is the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Subsistence to Supermarket</EMPHASIS>, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The unit was asked to report on the potential opportunities for agricultural and food exports Australia could exploit and to assess how well we are exploiting them and how we could exploit them better. With a brief like that, certain issues will be overlooked or ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that South East Asia has moved from a basically self-sufficient peasant economy to a formal economy, with a transformation of the agricultural sector to a more concentrated, mechanised agriculture increasingly dominated by agri-business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not noted is the social consequences of these changes. It is assumed that the changes are good&mdash;more money, a better society. In many cases, the formalisation of rural economies and transformation of agriculture has had the effect of seeing people driven off the land into urban slums. This cannot be seen as an improvement. In some cases, people have been driven off through economics; in others, they have been driven off at the point of a gun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank, in a recent report, concluded in a survey of six east Asian economies that Thailand had not made major inroads into the reduction of poverty during the 1980s. It noted that Thailand's incidence of poverty was as high as Indonesia's, although the average gross national product per capita was 250 per cent higher. This is because development is uneven. The rural populations are simply not benefiting from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I focus on Thailand because it is frequently held up as a special success, even among the ASEAN nations. On page 5, the report notes the regionalisation of production, citing Thailand as an example. Thailand, it states, is starting to invest in production outside its borders. This bears closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example cited is the Thai development of forestry production in Indochina and Myanmar. What does this mean? The situation has arisen because Thailand has so heavily exploited its own forest resources that the government was forced to act to ban logging. It is actually not quite a reasonable description of reality in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Khor Jor Kor relocation program involved the army moving villagers at gunpoint from forests to rehabilitate them. Rehabilitation consisted of clear-felling the forests and planting eucalypts for the Japanese pulp industry. Strong rural activism, widespread protests at these actions, at the murder of resisting villagers and at the arrest of monks who were protesting against these moves, and international pressure have all resulted in a review of the program, particularly after the overthrow of the Suchinda regime in late 1992. The program has been replaced by a royal project, however, which many Thais feel is equally bad. Another royal project involves the clear-felling of the last stand of native pine forest and the relocation of hill tribes in north Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of such efforts to undermine the logging ban, logging&mdash;especially the logging of teak&mdash;has slowed markedly in Thailand. Thais, unable to exploit their own forests, have turned to the massive extraction of forests in neighbouring nations, particularly Myanmar and Cambodia. The stripping of Burmese forests has had a devastating impact on the Karen people and is a source of many of the problems within Myanmar. Huge volumes of teak are taken every year, with no consideration of sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of Cambodian forests has involved the active assistance of the Khmer Rouge. In the face of the sanctions put on Cambodia in 1992, timber traders volunteered to assist in peacemaking. They cited their longstanding trading relations with the Khmer Rouge as giving them a good understanding with that group. At the time, the government showed its position by massively upgrading roads and border checkpoints to allow an additional 50,000 cubic metres of timber to pass to Thailand before the sanctions were put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sanguine statements of this report mask a grim reality of environmental and human exploitation. There are a number of other issues I wish to raise in connection with this report regarding its implications. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>This committee was set up under the National Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992, which came into effect on 24 December 1992. The committee makes recommendations to the government on matters concerning natural resources management and investigates and reports to the Commonwealth on matters referred to it concerning natural resources management. It acknowledges that landcare is a broad-based community concern that affects each and every one of us. Through its composition, it acknowledges that landcare is very much made up of a community based organisation, a community based movement, for both farmers and non-farmers, and that the wider community needs to be involved in the development of landcare policies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are over halfway through the decade of landcare and much has been done. Over 1,000 landcare groups operate across the nation and their work is to be applauded. The committee is of importance in providing the community's view on landcare to the government. It should be encouraged in this task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the report of the National Landcare Advisory Committee. This report is worthy of notice. The NLAC has a wide role in advising government on the important issue of landcare. Landcare, within the scope of NLAC's brief, also includes water care, and is not restricted to agriculture but includes rangeland, forestry and urban environments. It can advise, as various groups can make submissions, but the government need not take that advice or even pass it on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not doubt the good intentions of the government on landcare. The government has been very supportive of the need for it and takes the issue seriously. We regret that the advice usually stays within departments and that the ultimate fate of initiatives is decided by cabinet and a small group of people concerned with fiscal management. The consideration of reports such as these is one of the few times the parliament actually hears from the NLAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note with some satisfaction that the NLAC is recommending several measures we have supported for some time. Section 2.2.5 suggests that more positive incentives are needed to encourage the adoption of landcare. I mentioned a number of such initiatives in my speech the other day supporting Senator Coulter's amendment to tax bill No. 3, suggesting that donations of natural heritage should be given the same treatment as donations of built heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 2.2.7 suggests a strong coordination and integration of all measures at all tiers of government. Section 2.2.2 specifically notes the need for work with local government. Section 2.2.9 echoes my suggestion that banks should be required to consider the management practices of farms or stations when giving loans, especially in regard to landcare. Section 2.2.11 notes that there are many options to mix an economic return with conservation by shifting to high value, low volume products and through properly managed tourism. Sections 2.2.8 and 2.2.10 highlight the ongoing problems of land and water degradation. Under section 2.3, the NLAC makes more explicit the need for urban landcare and suggests a separate body to counter the perception that landcare is only about agricultural farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from reading this that landcare is more than this. It concerns rangelands&mdash;for instance, pastoral leases. The issue highlighted in section 2.2.3, the involvement of Aboriginal people, relates in many cases to pastoral leases and to the fact that in some states there is reticence to declare a pastoral lease held by Aboriginal people as no longer viable, converting it to some other title, and therefore eliminating the requirement for it to be run on a pastoral lease&mdash;something that can damage the environment while increasing the management costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole area of pastoral leases is of concern. Some of those concerns have been voiced regarding the desertification convention. The concern for water care is also important, and really taking that up a notch in terms of programs regarding water conservation, protection of waterways, rural sewerage programs, fringing vegetation and so on, could have major benefits to Australia, particularly if some consideration for water conservation in relation to drought was incorporated into the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that has not been tackled by the NLAC but has been recommended by this chamber is that the NLAC should consider examining landcare in the context of climate change. What defensive strategies are possible and available? Are there ways to minimise risks to both land users and the land? Are there any areas or practices that can be identified as particularly important for either affirmative or preventative action? In conclusion, we hope that the general support for landcare will translate into an even stronger political will than the government has yet shown. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Wool Realisation Commission is the body that was given the unenviable task of selling down the wool stockpile to meet the repayment schedule required by the government after the collapse of the reserve price scheme in 1991. The AWRC took over the Australian Wool Corporation's $2.7 billion debt and the 4.6 million bale stockpile, warehouses and related property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWRC's main task was to discharge the debt in accordance with the specified seven-year repayment program by disposing of the stockpile. Its task was made extremely difficult for a number of reasons: firstly, the overhang of the immense amount of wool in the stockpile&mdash;over one year's production was there; secondly, the set repayment schedule; thirdly, the necessary transparency of the AWRC's operation, which made its business decisions extremely difficult; fourthly, the 1993 global recession; and, fifthly, all of these, combined with a high level of wool production, made the method of stockpile reduction and debt repayment a non-viable combination. It became essential for a change in stockpile disposal policy as a result of this. The government's Garnaut committee recommended that the AWRC be replaced by Wool International, a new body which has the responsibility of disposing of a fixed quantity of wool until privatisation, targeted for 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within its charter, the AWRC operated as best it might, and can take some credit for reinstilling confidence in buyers and processors of wool that the stockpile will be managed commercially and responsibly. I commend Mr Bob Richardson, the Managing Director of the AWRC, for the way in which he carried out his role. His commitment to the job and his knowledge of the wool industry were recognised by his appointment to head the new body, Wool International. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry is suffering from the drought, with the added burden of four years of prices that have made it impossible to have any fat to meet the present crisis. However, the conservative stockpile reduction schedule now set by Professor Garnaut, coupled with the world lifting out of recession and, more importantly, a confident wool trade, indicates that at last there is hope for this very great Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the stockpile has been reduced to 3.5 million bales and forward selling has reinforced the optimistic approach to wool's future. The worry faced by the industry now is the very capacity of the Australian industry to survive this drought and to meet customer needs and expected increases in demand. The worry is that wool production will fall dramatically in 1994-95, although the clip forecasting people suggest that at this stage only a small fall is expected. I do not believe this. I would be surprised if there was not another substantial rise in the market indicator price in the next 12 months. That will make it very difficult to give the confidence that the trade requires and a permanency in supply.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, a substantial increase in price is something the industry can do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is clear: the stockpile reduction method must not be changed, and I do not believe it will be. Wool growers can be confident that Wool International is performing well. They can look forward to a valuable equity in 1997 when Wool International is returned to them in the form of shares. It will be a very happy day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The annual report of the Anti-Dumping Authority is a short but interesting report. Dumping refers to the practice of selling goods at a price which is less than the normal value of such goods in the country of export. About 70 per cent of trade is dumped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority also deals with trade in goods which has been subsidised. Measures taken to counteract subsidies are called countervailing measures. Dumping and subsidies are seen as unfair trading designed to open markets to other nations through unfair competition. A duty is applied to such goods to counteract this attempt to distort the market. This is what the Anti-Dumping Authority does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue then arising is whether anti-dumping laws are mis-used by nations as a trade barrier. Australia has been noted as a nation with a very active anti-dumping regime, and this has been the target of criticism in the trading community. This is partially because few other nations have anti-dumping laws, frequently because tariff and other duties are more dominant. We have followed the practice of unilaterally stripping away virtually all tariff barriers, which makes us more susceptible than other nations to dumping and subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of anti-dumping gains greater prominence with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation or WTO. From now on, it is not nations but the WTO that will decide on anti-dumping and countervailing measures. As noted in pamphlets from the ministry for customs, this will result in technical but significant changes to our anti-dumping regime. There is also the issue that the Uruguay Round agreement imposed limits on the use of countervailing duties to defend against subsidised food and agricultural exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority notes that anti-dumping cases diminished mainly because ICI was not bringing cases of dumping of chemicals before it. Indeed, inquiries have declined since 1991-92, although reviews of customs decisions are up. The report on page 2 notes the scope of complaints in the past, with enormous actions being brought against some 20 different countries. It notes that fewer claims occur but does not indicate whether this is the result of less dumping globally, the presence of a regulatory regime resulting in fewer attempts to dump in Australia, a stronger position of our industry leading to less concern with the level of dumping and subsidy, or whether there is some other reason that companies feel it is not worthwhile to pursue dumping and subsidy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is because the Anti-Dumping Authority is essentially reactive. It does not monitor trade or attempt to identify dumping, relying instead on the private sector to make claims. The authority therefore has little understanding of why a reduction of claims is occurring, or whether they might increase. Opinion in the authority is that dumping has not decreased at all, and that the decline is a result of the attitude of both major parties against regulation of trade, and the more outward looking approach of business with global economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the behaviour of nations in deciding to subsidise, or companies deciding to dump, is going to involve factors other than statistical trend. They relate to international, national and corporate economics and the trade regulatory regime. This latter is a particular issue in light of the new WTO procedures for dispute resolution. In the past, the GATT required a unanimous vote of contracting parties. Under the new WTO it will be significantly easier to deem an anti-dumping or countervailing duty as impermissible. Along with lack of detail about the cause of reported changes, there is no real projection of the consequences of change in the international regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to bring up a final issue in the context of this report. One of the primary proposals for environmental regulation is that the lack of environmental controls leading to environmental devastation in order to hold prices down is a sort of subsidy. It is therefore suggested that countervailing duties could be used, with the money collected hypothecated to environmental rehabilitation. The Greens would support such a move, which would need some support from international trade organisations. Currently, or in the next few weeks, the WTO, the United Nations ESCAP, the OECD and UNCTAD are all having meetings of committees set up to examine the relationship between the environment and trade or development, and to consider means of regulating trade and development to slow global environmental degradation. We will be watching closely for new regulations that affect anti-dumping and countervailing legislation; we will also be watching the Anti-Dumping Authority itself. I suggest that other senators do likewise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I spoke of my concern about the evidence that was given at the Perth hearing of the inquiry into funding in CSIRO for agricultural research. I spoke about the fact that I saw two major reasons for less funding being available for general research, including agricultural research. One of those concerned what I believe to be the `commoditisation' of knowledge and information. This seems to be having the impact on individual scientists working within CSIRO&mdash;and this can be extrapolated to many of the universities throughout Australia and throughout the world&mdash;who are each working on trying to reinvent the same wheel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists might be working in the same department but cannot speak to each other because each is working on a privately funded project. Because of the nature of the patenting system, intellectual property concerns and so on, they cannot speak to each other about the work they are doing. They may be working in opposite directions but it may be that they are inventing the same wheel. It is also the case, it would seem, that a great deal of the time now spent by scientists involves chasing around after patents. Quite a considerable amount of time was talked about&mdash;perhaps up to 25 per cent. So we are having scientists dealing with areas with which they are not familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the problem that scientists who are not as familiar and as skilled in dealing with such issues as intellectual property may be putting public money into particular areas, and being done over by the process and the fact that other people are picking up their ideas and then patenting them, meaning that other people have the exclusive right. How does one patent an idea? How does one know that it is some person's idea and not another person's idea? How does one then restrict the use of those ideas in other places? This is having a real impact on general research here and in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major point that I felt came out in that hearing was that in the attempt to require CSIRO to find a higher proportion of private funding, we perhaps have lost a lot of the impact of what CSIRO was established to do. What in fact happens, according to those people who gave evidence, is that a great deal of scientists' time is used chasing private financing, putting in submissions and so on. That means that actual research time is reduced. It also means that the people who commission research by CSIRO, and who then get fairly substantial tax deductions for doing so&mdash;so in reality it is mainly the taxpayer who has paid it; and I have said this in the past&mdash;have a very high proportion of control over what research is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was estimated at this hearing that 30 per cent of private funding can result in 70 per cent control over the research that is being done. This means that more specific research, applied research, is being carried out for particular bodies, not necessarily for agricultural bodies or organisations that have the public good at heart. So it means that more and more resources are being pulled away from general research in a whole raft of areas, including the environment. This is a great worry, because we begin to wonder whether CSIRO, being pushed to get a greater and greater proportion of private funding, is actually wasting research money. A great deal of this is involved in management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we have to really rethink whether or not we do need pure research. There is clear evidence throughout the world that it is pure research that leads to the most important discoveries in our society, not specifically targeted industrial research. We have to think about whether we want to be the clever country, or whether we want, for the sake of privatisation, to ruin this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA>When I looked at the annual report, I noted that at item 2.13 and 2.14 the Electoral Commission talked about compliance investigations and also investigations and prosecutions of actions relating to elections in previous years. I have been looking at these reports for some years, and I was hoping to have my memory refreshed in relation to an action which I recall being mentioned in the parliament about commissioners investigating some irregularities alleged to have occurred in relation to the Australian Democrats&mdash;I think it was in the New South Wales division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was hoping that this report may have indicated the results of that investigation and whether any proceedings had been instituted against the Australian Democrats or any other persons in relation to those investigations. It may well be that the investigations are not yet complete. It may be that they are complete and action has been taken or they are complete and the commission has decided to take no action. One way or another&mdash;because it was a fairly important matter, and I understand there were some fairly serious allegations&mdash;I hoped that the commission would have reported upon it in this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to another matter which relates to the redistribution of electoral boundaries in Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. I am pleased to say that because of the continuing growth in my state of Queensland we have been allocated yet another federal seat, and the redistribution has concluded in my state. One of the roles of the Electoral Commission is, of course, for the preparation and production of redistribution maps and reports. I note at page 30 of the report that the commission is also charged with the responsibility of making the community aware of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as much information as is necessary to enable active and informed participation in the electoral process.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Queensland redistribution, there was a reasonably minor alteration to the boundaries in the electorate of Herbert, which are based on Townsville in an area where I have my office and adjacent to an area where I live. I found it very difficult to get information of exactly where that boundary went. Certainly, maps were published in the newspaper but they can be, of necessity, only very broad maps. From the broad maps published, it did not look like there was much change in the electorate. It was only a couple of days before the objections closed that someone suggested to me that there was to be quite a dramatic change in the electorate, one which may or may not have had quite significant electoral consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At almost the eleventh hour, I then tried to get copies of where the boundaries went&mdash;which streets they covered, which suburbs they cut in and which suburbs they cut out. I regret to say that it was rather difficult for me to find out where exactly the boundary went. I did eventually get on to an officer in Canberra, whose name I wish I could remember because he was very helpful. He went out of his way to find out the information and he sought authority from various people, which seemed a bit strange to me, but in any case I eventually did get the results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I saw them, I realised that there was quite a dramatic change. I was concerned that the public of Townsville had not been told that part of their city was being cut off. A couple of suburbs in the southern part of the Townsville City Council were cut off, taken out of the Townsville based electorate and included in the Dawson electorate, which is based upon Mackay, some 400 kilometres to the south. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the people involved were not aware of it. I immediately tried to make them aware of it by using the media. I put in an objection myself, but it was a bit late for most of the people to understand what was happening. I was concerned about that. As it turned out, the Electoral Commission did hear objections. It did not take any notice of mine,</PARA>
<PARA>nor the objection of more than 250 petitioners who were able to lodge a petition in those last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, unfortunately, the city of Townsville is now cut in two, with a couple of the southern suburbs taken out of the Townsville based electorate and put in with Mackay, 400 kilometres to the south.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is an interesting document. It is a bit of an arcane document, because not a lot of people take a great deal of interest in the operation of the Bankruptcy Act. The Bankruptcy Act is very important because it is one of the instruments of public policy which is used to enforce some sort of decent behaviour in business dealings. It is important, therefore, that the act operates properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is also interesting because it gives very good statistical breakdowns of bankruptcies by state, age, industry classification, cause of bankruptcy and so on. One of the disturbing things that I noted was the large increase in bankruptcies in Tasmania, which grew by more than 11 per cent. More disturbing than that was the age distribution of people who became bankrupt in Tasmania in the previous financial year. Of the 656 people who became bankrupts, 285 were under 34 years of age. Ninety of them were aged under 25. That means that 43 per cent of bankrupts in Tasmania were young people. That is substantially above the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear, from looking at other statistical information, that the principal reason for the non-business bankruptcies would tend to be unemployment. That shows that it is the young people who are suffering. It is interesting that not just unemployment is being visited upon them, but also bankruptcy. That is a terrible stigma to have when one is a young person, because it basically means three years taken out of a person's life&mdash;three years in which they cannot start to buy a house or proceed to accumulate assets, all the normal things that people do at that age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must pay attention to how we run the economy to ensure that that level of failure is not visited upon young people. There are other ways out, but one of the problems is that young people generally do not avail themselves of the provisions of part X of the Bankruptcy Act and become debtors under administration. The flow of information to them is not sufficient, and generally they do not have a lot of assets to put up for a deed of arrangement, a composition or something like that. So there is an unfairness which we are perceiving at the moment. I hope that it is something which will change over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect I want to comment on&mdash;and I commented on this last year&mdash;is funding under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. Funding under section 305 is intended to provide money for trustees to run legal actions in the estates of bankrupts where there are no assets. As honourable senators would appreciate, the best way for crooked bankrupts to ensure that they do not get pursued is to not leave any money in their estate. The trustees get appointed to a state with no assets; therefore, nothing can be done to realise funds to pursue the bankrupts for whatever unsatisfactory behaviour they indulged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 305 was intended to provide funding for that but it is interesting to note that the number of applications approved under section 305 has steadily declined from a peak of 237 in 1986-87 to 41 in the last financial year. The estimated cost of those 41 applications was a mere $302,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare that with the receipts of the registered trustees, which were some $54.6 million last year, and the receipts of the official trustees, which were some $28 million, it is very clear that the official receiver has received several million dollars in charges on the realisations that trustees are forced to lodge with the official receiver. Yet nothing substantial has come out of section 305 funding. It was always intended that the charge on realisations that the trustees must lodge was substantially to fund section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act. Yet a mere $302,000 was the estimated cost and the rest has been snaffled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the report that the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy states that the operations of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia are substantially funded by the taxpayer. I believe that they are also very heavily subsidised by those realisations and they are funded by creditors. But even to the extent that they are funded by the taxpayers, ITSA's operations are very important. As I said, part of the process of implementing public policy is ensuring that people who indulge in unsatisfactory business conduct do not get away with it.

<PARA>I am interested in the Department of Defence report for 1993-94 for several reasons. One is the fact that consultants were employed by the department during the year at a cost of $53.3 million. One particular consultant is a company called Malindoqueen, a consultancy that cost the department $174,000. That company was the subject of a question that I put on notice to the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, from whom I received a reply this week. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, has ordered a top-level inquiry into a government contract awarded to a private company to obtain sensitive information about priorities in Indonesia's defence expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move follows questions raised by the Federal Opposition about the company's operations and its level of access to classified Australian defence security material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Ray has asked the Inspector-General in Defence, Mr Frank Harvey, to investigate the nature of the government contract granted to the Australian company, Malindoqueen Consultants, between July 1993 and June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister is believed to be concerned that his department awarded the sensitive defence contract to Malindoqueen without receiving appropriate high-level approval.</PARA>
<PARA>I further understand that the department was using Malindoqueen to ascertain the Indonesian navy's interest in purchasing high-powered submarines from Australia. It seems extraordinary that the information for which Malindoqueen was paid $174,000 to get was not available through Australian defence attaches in Jakarta. Was that because the information was not readily available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will seek leave later to table a letter from Mr Mike Waller, First Assistant Secretary of the Industry Involvement and Contracting Section of the Department of Defence, supporting an application for residency from the director of Malindoqueen. He says that, under the its contract, Malindoqueen is required to `introduce the department to higher Indonesian defence circles and obtain information about priorities in Indonesian defence expenditure'. Surely if that were public information it would be readily available. Is this an attempt to get information through the back door or some other way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Waller went on to say that the work being done for the Department of Defence was of `undoubted strategic importance to Australia'. So what is this all about? I can inform the Senate that today I put on notice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the reply to my question on Notice No. 1687 by the Minister for Defence in which he reveals he has ordered a top-level enquiry by the Inspector General in Defence into a contract by his department with a company called Malindoqueen which the Minister for Defence has directed should not be renewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of the nature of this contract, which has been described by Mr Mike Waller, First Assistant Secretary of the Industry Involvement and Contracting section of the department of Defence, in a letter to the Department of Immigration supporting an Australian residency application by a director of Malindoqueen, as requiring Malindoqueen to "introduce the department to higher Indonesian defence circles and obtain information about priorities in Indonesian defence expenditure"?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was the department of Foreign Affairs ever advised by the Department of Defence that it was employing, since July 1993, a foreign national to obtain, at undisclosed cost&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I have since discovered that the cost was $174,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">confidential details of Indonesian defence spending priorities that were not available to Australian defence staff at the Australian embassy in Djakarta?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was this an operation whose objective was to offer bribes or other inducements to Indonesian officials and are such activities condoned by the government and the Department of Foreign Affairs?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To what extent does this kind of activity put at risk our friendly relationship with Indonesia and what is the Minister doing to prevent such diplomatically embarrassing events recurring?</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the Australian Tourist Commission and to congratulate it on the work that it does. The job of the commission is to market Australia overseas as a tourist destination. Tourism is probably the most competitive market in the world. In Australia we have benefited enormously from the work of individual entrepreneurs, theme parks and resorts, all working hand in glove with the Australian Tourist Commission. They are a good combination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism has really developed right throughout Australia&mdash;in my own state of Queensland, from Cairns down to the Gold Coast and into the northern parts of New South Wales. However, it should borne in mind that while even with all that effort we get only one per cent of the world tourist trade, from our largest single market, Japan, we pick up five per cent. Yet there is an impression in the community that we get all the Japanese tourists, which is of course far from true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Tourist Commission does a first-class job. The people who work for it are dedicated. Over the last couple of months I have had the pleasure and the honour of meeting some of them. I met up with wholesalers and airlines representatives in places such as Taiwan and Japan and they all spoke very highly of the work done by the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, a couple of hiccups on the horizon, and I think they should be mentioned. The first is that there is growing interference by the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in the work of the commission. Tourism is these people's job and they are measured by the results they produce. Increasingly, they are getting notes, allegedly from the minister, demanding reports be made. This is taking up an inordinate amount of time on work that should be done competing against other countries to get foreign tourists to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern I have, and I looked for this in the report, is that in my travels overseas I found that key people from the Australian Tourist Commission were leaving and going into the private sector. The reason is that the government has not seen fit to give flexibility to the Australian Tourist Commission to retain these people. They have been a very valuable asset to this country and it is important that their expertise not be lost simply because of the inflexibility of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I want to mention&mdash;this was raised in recent days at the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee by a range of people, including the chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission&mdash;is that tourism here may be in jeopardy because of a lack of accommodation. It was pointed out by Mr Iwasaki that Australia must address its dramatic accommodation shortage. He also said that it may be dangerous for Australia to become too conceited over having such rich resources in tourism. The well-known Japan Travel Bureau urged better planning of accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone has known that this problem has been looming for the past couple of years. The demand is apparent, and the question is often asked: if the demand is there, why are these resorts not being built? There are a number of reasons and all of them can be sheeted back to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons is the difficulties encountered by people who want to build resorts. This is because we have governments prepared to listen to vocal minorities whose threats throw the development of projects into jeopardy at the expense of the communities and regions concerned, and at the expense of employment in those regions. We have seen these sorts of blockages. Recently there was one at Byron Bay, and now there is the one at Port Hinchinbrook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is the plethora of taxes imposed by various governments on an industry which is labour intensive. If our industry is going to pick up in a market which, as I mentioned earlier, is the most competitive market in the world, and employ these people, particularly the young people, these barriers must be turned around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these factors send out terrible signals to financial institutions, which have been a bit nervous anyway in recent times, and prospective investors. Many businesses and organisations, such as the ATC, have spent a lot of time and money promoting Australia as a destination for overseas tourists. Unless these impediments are addressed, we as a nation will suffer and the real jobs which this industry has the potential to create will not eventuate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with and support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Parer, who is the shadow minister for tourism and a person who is very much aware of what is happening in this industry. I certainly support Senator Parer's remarks about the accommodation shortage. I speak from experience in Far North Queensland, where there is a real shortage in Cairns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer was correct when he said that governments&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;have to look very seriously at the impediments they place in the way of these increased tourist activities. At particular fault is the federal government for the way it taxes the tourist industry and small business and for not being game, because of its close connections with the ACTU, to make industrial relations as flexible as they should be. Is it simply not able to do what it knows needs to be done in that regard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make the comment that the Australian Tourist Commission could almost be called the New South Wales Tourist Commission because the seven of its 10 board directors come from New South Wales, the majority from Sydney. Of the other three, one comes from Queensland, one from Victoria and the head of the department is in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems incredible to me. It is a bit like the grants for elite artists; the good artists seem to live only in Sydney. Apparently the people who know anything about the tourist industry seem to live only in Sydney as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I concede that the board and the commission do a good job in promoting Australia, I do not understand why the board members could not come from other parts of Australia and lend the expertise and regional knowledge they would have to that board. I am not suggesting that the current incumbents are not competent and good at their job, but I am sure that there are persons equally qualified and who could make an equal contribution to tourism promotion who live in other states and other cities besides Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder why, if this government is at all interested in regional development and decentralisation, the headquarters of this commission have to be in Sydney. Why can they not be in Ballarat, Bendigo, Port Lincoln or Perth? Why not in Mackay, Ballina, Coolangatta or Tweed Heads? Why not in Nowra, Alice Springs, Cairns or Townsville?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days these sorts of offices could be established anywhere. The support mechanisms are available in most Australian cities and, of course, with communications the way they are, there does not seem to be any real reason that this type of organisation, particularly one dealing with tourism, could not be established in another city around Australia. If that were to happen it would be a tremendous boost for regional development, it would be a tremendous boost for decentralisation and it would create a lot of activity in some other town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government: why Sydney? Why does everything have to be concentrated in Sydney? Is it because the minister, who is known to be one of the movers and shakers in the New South Wales Right, comes from Sydney? It is quite interesting that this minister is also the minister in charge of the arts, and he seems to have a fixation with Sydney and cannot see beyond the harbour shores when picking the best artists for grants and the best people to put on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the board travelled about a bit last year and moved out of Sydney to Brisbane and Melbourne. But again I wonder why it cannot move a bit further afield? Why not have some meetings in Cairns, Nowra, Ballarat, Perth or perhaps Darwin? It would seem that that would be an appropriate way for this Sydney-based organisation to show that it is taking into account the interests of other tourist areas in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The third report of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operations of the Australian Loan Council was completed and tabled in December of last year. As the final report notes, the Senate inquiry proceeded on the twin assumptions that the Loan Council process itself was in some disarray, and that it was in the public interest that the facts surrounding the so-called Victorian loans affair be revealed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report made a total of six recommendations, and it is heartening to note that the government, in its response, has acknowledged the worth of each of those recommendations. During my time on the Senate committee, I took considerable interest in the question of accrual accounting, and the implications of that concept for accountability in government and transparency in public sector transactions. For those reasons, I particularly supported the committee's recommendation relating to the adoption of accrual accounting as a matter of priority by all state and federal governments and including Loan Council disclosures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an important submission to the committee, Professor Bob Officer and Mr Saul Eslake from the Victorian Commission of Audit pointed to the deficiencies of current government accounting where accrual accounting was not used. They pointed out, for example, that accrual accounting would help in reducing the opportunities for window-dressing budget results by shifting cash transactions around balance dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accrual accounting is considered a superior method of accounting as it results in accounting measurements based on the substance of transactions and events rather than merely on cash received and disbursed. Accrual accounting results in better financial information, better performance measurement, better asset management, better debt management and a clearer picture of a government's overall financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its response to the committee's report, the government makes the point that the Loan Council itself could only move to an accrual system when all its members had done so on a consistent basis. I understand that considerable progress has been made on the move towards full accrual accounting by commonwealth departments and agencies, with the latter being able to report on an accruals basis fully by the end of this financial year. In addition, each state and territory has moved along this road to varying extents. My plea today is for all states and territories to give urgent attention to this matter and to fall in behind the commonwealth in this very significant reform of public accounting methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further recommendations related to uniform reporting requirements, auditing of reports and the making of such reporting requirements legally binding on the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments through an amendment to the financial agreement. Again, I am pleased to note that many of the underlying aims of these recommendations have been achieved by the signing in February of this year of the new financial agreement and the introduction of complementary state and territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome many of the recent reforms to the operations and guidelines of the Loan Council. The important principles of greater disclosure and improved accountability, which I have already spoken on earlier, are of great significance. The Australian public requires and deserves greater accountability in all aspects of government sector operations. After all, it is not the government's money that is at risk, it is the money belonging to the Australian taxpayer. Public sector activities, whether they be current spending, capital spending or the sale of government assets, should all be totally transparent and subject to the most comprehensive guidelines possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the start that has been made on reforming the operations and reporting guidelines of the Australian Loan Council are only the beginning of a more extensive overhaul of all public sector operations which will ensure the best value for the taxpayers' dollar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is very welcome indeed. It is very thorough and detailed, and it pays a great deal of attention to the shortcomings of the citizenship act as it now is and the amendments that need to be considered by government. I believe that a very important first step has been taken. I wish to comment on two particular aspects of the report. One of them is the area of education and information for citizenship, and the other is the dual citizenship concept which the report recommends should be available to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that the recommendations dealing with the educational information program are extremely well targeted and worth while&mdash;for instance, calling for an increase among all Australians of the awareness and understanding about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Further, it seeks to introduce in the Australian schools curriculum a course on Australian institutions and history, the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship and the principles and values of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways this is an extremely important emphasis. We all agree that people coming to this country need this information and, to a greater or lesser extent, efforts are made to provide them with that information. But during the last decade or so, I believe that citizenship education has been sadly lacking in our school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak at schools quite a lot in Victoria. I have spoken to about 200 different schools in the last two or three years on the workings of the Australian Parliament. I believe that this is extremely important because I think the old adage that we get the government and the leaders we deserve is very true. If we ask people to vote in the political system without knowing the system and how it works, and the consequences of making certain decisions, I believe the concept of citizenship becomes somewhat of a mockery. I have found during those visits to schools, particularly during the last year or two, that class sizes have diminished. Politics or civics or whatever we want to call it&mdash;and there are different names being used for these various courses&mdash;have been made elective subjects. They are not part of the core curriculum, and fewer students apparently opt for these courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier reports have been submitted to the Senate. One is called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education for active citizenship 1989</EMPHASIS>, which makes very strong recommendations that the Commonwealth initiate a national program in education for active citizenship. I regret to say that this recommendation, in my view, does not appear to have been taken up. There is really no evidence that our education system has responded to that challenge. I think that committee made a very good contribution to that debate. I note that Senator Paul McLean from the Democrats was a member of that committee, and it was chaired by Senator Terry Aulich. I believe it is a great pity that that recommendation was not taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another report in March 1991 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Active citizenship revisited</EMPHASIS>. Once again we have a recommendation. The committee recommended that school systems identify, publicise and support existing citizenship education initiatives and encourage their extension to other schools. Once again, I believe that suggestion was not taken up. It was a suggestion very strongly supported by the Australian Democrats, and I note that Senator Robert Bell and Senator Cheryl Kernot were at various times members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome very much this recommendation that was made once again in this report that is now before the Senate, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians all: enhancing Australian citizenship</EMPHASIS>. I hope that this time the education system and the people who make decisions in the education system as we move towards 2000 will take some note of it and that these recommendations will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that some years ago, when I first became aware of the appalling ignorance amongst young people of how they can participate in the political process as citizens, I wrote to the then Minister for Education in Victoria, Joan Kirner. I received a reply saying that she agreed with me that it should be made part of the core curriculum&mdash;that all children should have the benefit of history, should know the duties, responsibilities and rights of citizenship and should have the opportunity of finding out how they can take part in the political process. She said, `But I have Buckley's of getting it implemented. I am sorry to say that I would not get it through.' I hope that this, the third report, will be treated better and that this recommendation will now be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wanted to raise in relation to this report concerns dual citizenship. I believe that generally speaking in the global community we are moving to a stage where nation states are diminishing in importance and where we more and more see ourselves as global citizens. In a sense, this is reflected in what is happening in Europe. We might soon, instead of having individual countries, have a united Europe. That is fine and welcome and probably would be a very constructive influence for achieving lasting peace and for economic matters, trade and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one situation where dual citizenship could produce a problem: when, much to all our regret, a country gets involved in a conflict. If a person has dual citizenship, and it is a dual citizenship that implies or constitutes some allegiance to a country with which Australia may be in conflict, how is that resolved and would it be that, automatically, these people would be interned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the thought that, while we should allow people to enjoy the benefits of dual citizenship and the privileges this might offer in other countries, we should also, very importantly, make it quite clear that an Australian citizen, first and foremost, owes allegiance to Australia, that this must be the overriding commitment, and this is so because that was the last declaration of allegiance that was made by that person. I believe this concept will be discussed and debated in future. It is a sound development. Above all, we must be certain that we are building a national identity which depends on the commitment of all citizens to this country of ours&mdash;Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence. This is the report, of course, that reveals the scandal relating to the Casselden Place Building in Melbourne, where the federal Labor government has lost $103 million of taxpayers' money. This has been the subject of a return to order by the Senate earlier this day when Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, was required to table by 5.00 p.m. this day three specific documents referred to in section 9.78 of the Auditor-General's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all honourable senators would be aware, it is now 10 minutes past six and these documents have not been tabled. So the Senate can quite rightly ask: why is the government continuing to seek to cover up this scandal in Melbourne? That is the question that all honourable senators should be asking this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does this report reveal that the Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. Frank Walker QC, misled this parliament by saying in a letter addressed to Senator McMullan and dated 4 May that no incentives were provided to the occupants of Casselden Place when the Auditor-General's report shows that incentives were offered, but it also proves that Senator McMullan misled the Senate and therefore the parliament when he reiterated the statement made by Mr Walker. Those two ministers are condemned for misleading this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are further condemned for continuing the cover-up of a property scandal of the proportions of WA Inc. conducted under the auspices of a federal Labor government. It is probably appropriate that this scandal took place in the city of Melbourne at a time when Premier Cain and then Premier Kirner were in charge and were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year of Victorian taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cover-up has now been further compounded by Senator Bolkus who, in responding to the motion that he be required to table these three letters&mdash;letters that have been cited and referred to by the Auditor-General in confirming that the department called these  financial inducements incentives&mdash;said that we can pass the motion if we like but we should not count on getting the documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the contempt that Senator McMullan has for this chamber. It has been compounded by Senator Bolkus. It was also compounded by Mr Walker when he said that the Senate is not entitled to this information. It is a contempt of this parliament but, more importantly, it is a contempt of the people of Australia who expect that a federal government will not only run its operations on sound business principles but be accountable for the expenditure of taxpayers' money to the people through the parliament. This government has shown absolute contempt for the people of Australia in, firstly, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars in this case and, secondly, refusing to allow the Senate and the parliament of Australia to properly scrutinise the government's financial dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In rising to speak about this report tonight I specifically want to say that Senator Bolkus stands condemned for not complying with the order of the Senate to table these three letters. This is a continuation of a cover-up of a multimillion dollar Australian Labor Party financial mismanagement scandal. These ministers have continued to defy orders of the Senate and have misled the parliament now on two or three occasions about, firstly, the size of the loss; secondly, whether incentives were involved&mdash;the Auditor-General said they were; and, thirdly, the dealings within the building. Senator McMullan said that those dealings were all commercial and were all at arm's length and there was nothing to worry about. This Senate has uncovered a multimillion dollar scandal involving the federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should take quite seriously the actions of a minister who misleads this parliament. It is now quite clear that both Mr Walker and Senator McMullan have misled the Senate on at least one occasion&mdash;quite possibly two. The Senate should regard the behaviour of these ministers as most serious breaches of their ministerial responsibility. Senator McMullan is away at the moment, so he cannot defend himself. But, when the Senate resumes in a fortnight's time, he should certainly be required to make an explanation as to, firstly, why he keeps continuing to cover up the scandal and, secondly, why he misled parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failing a proper explanation of these matters, I can see absolutely no reason why Senator McMullan and Mr Walker should not resign their positions as ministers. This should be regarded as a most serious breach of their responsibilities. Either they misled the Senate knowingly and, therefore, created what should be a hanging offence for a minister; or, if they did so unknowingly, they breached their ministerial responsibility because they certainly should have been responsible for the actions of their department&mdash;particularly bearing in mind that the Senate has raised these matters over a period of many months and all we have got as a response from the government is a covering up, just a continual refusal to table the documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the minister for his courtesy in sending me a copy of the document so that I could have a look at what he was going to table. I appreciate that. However, a lot of the documents which the Senate requested are not being tabled. The government is claiming commercial-in-confidence for a lot of the documents. I find this absolutely extraordinary. This is about a company&mdash;ANL&mdash;that the minister said on 22 August could not be given away. The Senate was seeking documents relating to the relationship between the minister and the company prior to 22 August. At that time the government's judgment was that the company could not be given away; that it was worthless. I fail to see why documents relating to a relationship between the minister and that company should not be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago we had correspondence between the minister and the company tabled. Those documents quite clearly show that there was a not very healthy relationship between the minister and the company. The minister's handling of this whole operation since early this year has been poor. That is why the Senate wanted to see the documents&mdash;to find out what had been going on. For the government to complain that these are commercial-in-confidence documents that will affect the operation of ANL, when it said on 22 August that the company was worth nothing and we wanted documents prior to then, does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should note that in February this year the government changed the articles of association of this company, whereupon the government insisted that any decisions that affected the potential sale value of the company had to go through the minister. That meant that from February the minister was, in fact, in charge of the company and was directly responsible for what happened. The documents previously tabled clearly show that the minister was not responding to management, so there was a lot of responsibility lying on the minister's plate. He obviously was responsible for the poor shape of the company when he made the claim on 22 August that the company could not be given away. I express the strongest displeasure to the government for not tabling these documents in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to amendment No. 1 that has been moved by Senator Ellison to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. Prior to the luncheon adjournment I said that it was noteworthy that the government had failed to include in the bill not only the objects of the legislation but also the principles of the legislation. I think it was Senator Campbell who pointed out that, in a judgment handed down in New South Wales, it became evident that the objects of the Native Title Act were quite important. That point needs to be noted: the government did not include in the bill the objects of the legislation, much less the principles of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then arises as to whether the objects and the principles as proposed by Senator Ellison are to be supported, or whether the objects as outlined by Senator Kernot should be supported. At least the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens and I all believe that the objects of the legislation should be in the bill. I also happen to believe that the legislation should outline principles which should be adhered to. The government has indicated, through Senator Evans, that the major concern that it has is with new paragraph 191AB(b), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders who are most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands;</PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to have the objects as outlined in the opposition's amendment, it therefore follows logically that we should have some principles to be adhered to. The principle outlined in 191AB(b) seems to me to follow logically from the objects. I refer the Senate to the fact that the background of Senator Ellison's amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that many Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert meaningful title to those lands and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>Correct me if I am wrong, but I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated something similar. I do not know whether it was in those precise terms, but he certainly stated something similar. He certainly used the words `dispossessed from their lands'. The next paragraph goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the object of this Part is to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations through the acquisition and management of land.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words also echo in my ears as not being original, but are understood and accepted by most of the community. The next paragraph indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give effect to that object, this Part establishes a fund, known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, and a corporation, known as the Indigenous Land Corporation, to facilitate the acquisition and management of land for those Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA>If we recognise the fact that, because Aboriginal persons have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, certain things flow in order to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations through acquisition and management of land, there should be no opposition, in principle, to meeting the economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations of those who have been most severely dispossessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about the results of dispossession or if we are talking about assistance, as distinct from justice, then we really have to ask: who are those most in need? We hear this from the government all the time. It talks about those who are most in need. If we accept the objects proposed by Senator Ellison and Senator Kernot and if we accept that, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, we need to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations, there seems to be no logical reason to oppose, in principle, the proposition contained in 191AB(b). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then get to the practical situation. It has been put by the minister, and others, that this provision will cause untold delays and will eat into the already limited amounts that have been earmarked for the fund. It has been put to me by people, for whose views I have the utmost respect, that acceptance of the amendment would undoubtedly lead to irreconcilable conflict and division amongst Aboriginal communities and scarce resources having to be channelled into challenging and defending board decisions which would, in practice, also have the effect of paralysing the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to accept that that is a possibility but, in my view, that sort of possibility has to be put into the scales. The other scale contains the principle of social justice and the principle of natural justice. In my view, it comes down to those principles. If there are Aboriginal persons who are aggrieved by decisions of the ILC, surely they should have the assurance that the allocation of resources has some sort of priority; that those who have been most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands will get some sort of priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in the final analysis, after the bill has been passed and after the ILC has been in operation for some time, a situation of the nature that has been suggested arises, the parliament can revisit this matter. But the mere suggestion that these sorts of things may occur does not counterbalance the important principles of social justice&mdash;that is, giving priority to those most in need&mdash;and natural justice, which enables those persons in the ultimate to have some say about the prioritisation of resources. Under those circumstances, it is my view that the amendment moved by Senator Ellison and supported by the opposition and the Greens deserves the support of the Senate. I will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened very carefully to what Senator Harradine has said. I understand very well what has led him to come to his conclusion. However, might I make one more attempt, using his own frame of reference and argument, to persuade him that maybe this just is not the better course to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, on the question of the basic principles and the logic, as it were, of having the clause expressed in these terms, might I just suggest that, when we look at the basic theme of the background provision in the objects clauses that we agree on, the reference is to assisting those who have been dispossessed as distinct from those who have not been dispossessed. That is the theme, the flavour, the language and the content of those clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are translating the substance and effect of those clauses into the principles listed over the page, the logical transition is a principle expressed in the following terms: if a conflict arises as to the allocation of resources, preference is to be given to those who have been dispossessed rather than those who have not been dispossessed. That is as far as the logic of the language of the preamble goes. There is a logic in translating the language of the preamble into the language of principles, but the logic of the preamble only goes so far as to say `preference to the dispossessed'. As such, it is, in a sense, a reflection of the earlier debate that we had. If there is a choice between buying land for someone who might be able to establish a native title claim to it, who has maintained continuity of association and physical possession of it, if it is a choice between using land fund money for that purpose and using it for those who have been totally dispossessed and do not have any of that kind of relationship, there should not be a choice at all. There is no harm in the statute reflecting that. I suggest to Senator Harradine that that is as far as the logic takes him, in terms of his own chain of reasoning, if he wants to move from the language of the preambular objective to the language of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to the question of practicality and how this can be made to work in practice. Senator Harradine used the language `by comparison with those most in need', making the point that we are used to talking about those most in need. We are used to quantifying need; we are used to calibrating need; and, from a social justice perspective, so we should. Senator Harradine is saying that this is an analogue of that&mdash;that those who are most dispossessed should be given preference in exactly the same way as, in other social policy situations, we give preference to those who are most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty that I would like to put to Senator Harradine and ask him to seriously consider is that the notion of dispossession is not quantitatively ascertainable in the same way as the concept of need is ascertainable. We all know how need can be calculated&mdash;by reference to income, by reference to assets and criteria of that objectively ascertainable kind. But how do we determine who is more dispossessed than someone else? How on earth do we begin to calculate that particular kind of equation? The basic distinction, logically and in practice, is really only between those who, on the one hand, have been dispossessed and those who, on the other hand, have not been dispossessed, who have maintained their association and relationship with a particular piece of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there are some criteria that one could begin to contemplate as applicable here. There could be the criterion of duration. A person could be more dispossessed if it is a longer period in time since his or her father, grandfather or other ancestors had that kind of possessory relationship with the land in question. I suppose that could be applied, but how does that translate into a social justice need? How do you say that someone who has been off the land for less than a generation is somehow less deserving than someone who has been off the land for three or four generations? I am not sure that there is a translation of the one concept to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there could be a locational criterion. One could say that people out in the bush, in Moree or somewhere, are perhaps less dispossessed than people living in Redfern who have become totally absorbed in a city culture rather than in a rural culture which at least has some affinity or relationship with land, even if it is not the possessory relationship that was associated with original occupancy of the country. But it is a pretty tough criterion to apply to the fringe dwellers of Moree as compared with the urban dwellers of Redfern to say that the Moree people&mdash;I am just taking them as an example at random&mdash;have to miss out because in a conflict situation they are less dispossessed than people in Redfern. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were a clear-cut criterion, like the criterion of need, which was quantitatively ascertainable, applicable and calculable, then I would have a lot of difficulty in arguing with the way it has been put. The truth of the matter is that it ain't quantifiable in that way. It is a matter of impression. It is a matter of judgment. It is a matter of waiting around to determine what the courts are going to identify as the relevant criteria of dispossession. While we are waiting for the courts to tell us, one heck of a divisive environment will build up as people see the potential to argue their way through by using this particular clause. </PARA>

With every respect, knowing that we are about to plunge into an area of acute uncertainty and acute divisiveness, I do not think it is good enough to say that we can revisit this in one, two or three years time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make an appeal to Senator Harradine too. With the best motivation, we or the majority of this Senate may make a mistake. I started at exactly the same point Senator Harradine is at now. I had proposed to take forward that form of amendment myself. But having spoken with some Aboriginal people&mdash;and I acknowledge it is not an inclusive list but neither is anybody else's who is contributing to this debate&mdash;I have come to the view that we are making a mistake to attempt to categorise dispossession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hours since we adjourned this debate, I have had phone calls and a couple of faxes from Aboriginal people whom I do not know who seem to have found out we are doing on this matter and who are saying, `Please don't do this to us.' One of them said, `We cannot define dispossession in varying degrees, as dispossession is still 100 per cent dispossession'. I fear more though the divisiveness that exists. We can look at the case of ATSIC with its limited funding and we can see the divisions that are caused in communities when decisions have to be made. They are made on need and they are made genuinely, but we can already see the incredible amount of divisiveness that has come from this sort of process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to unduly delay the Senate, but it seems to me that quite fundamental errors are in danger of being perpetrated here simply because we are not stopping and giving enough thought to the sheer practical difficulty of defining in a non-arbitrary way what it is to be more dispossessed than someone else. It seems to me that there is a clear-cut distinction between those who are dispossessed and those who have not been dispossessed, which we can all readily understand. But once we start getting into the business of drawing distinctions between those who are more and less dispossessed, then we are inevitably back in the realm of a centrally arbitrary choice because there are no obvious criteria that one can point to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine pointed to the language of the preamble in terms of economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations and suggested that might be an appropriate touchstone and that we measure the degree of dispossession by the measure of economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations which have somehow accumulated as a result of the severance of a person's connection with the land. But how on earth does that work in practice? How does it serve the end of social justice, to define it in those terms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Aboriginal people, as we all know, in Australia live in urban areas. They are unequivocally dispossessed in the sense that their forefathers of long ago lost their links with their traditional land. I do not know how we can measure their economic, spiritual and cultural aspirations. There are ways of measuring their level of attainment. By and large, people living in urban areas have far greater economic opportunities and socioeconomic status than their fellow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote parts of Australia. The urban people might be more dispossessed, but in many ways they have many more opportunities for social advancement such as higher status, recognition and self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth does one say that the cause of social justice is better advanced by giving the nod to them in a conflict situation? Unless we can define it with some precision and clarity in the way that the concept of need can be defined with a degree of precision and clarity, it honestly seems to me that it is an almost impossible task that we are vesting in the corporation and in the courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to speak about Prime Minister Keating's `phoney feminism' and its alleged benefits to the political process. The recent motion to create a quota of 35 per cent of candidates to be preselected in `winnable' Labour Party seats has been celebrated by many community groups but, most notably, by ALP women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any proposal to get more women into parliament at both state and federal levels should be applauded and, more importantly, acted upon. We desperately need to break down the barriers which prevent 51 per cent of the voting population from gaining appropriate parliamentary representation, from helping to shape our society, from improving legislation and from acting as representative voices for the communities they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real sadness in all of this, of course, is that Paul Keating, our Prime Minister, has failed to see&mdash;or chosen to ignore the reality&mdash;where these barriers to entering parliament are. He has made loud, self-congratulatory noises&mdash;the media and other interest groups have swallowed them&mdash;about removing barriers within the preselection process, a place where there are few, if any, real barriers to be removed. Perhaps he has done so to suit his own purposes, but certainly within the Liberal Party there are really no barriers to women within that preselection process itself. If a woman stands and has merit, she is, in 1994, just as likely, if not more likely, to gain successful preselection from a group of candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberal preselectors are urged to preselect a woman, and have been doing so for some years now. Much of this has been due to a number of Liberal women who have worked tirelessly towards achieving equality of opportunities for women. In particular, I mention Chris McDiven, who is an example, both of herself and in her achievements, of what the ALP should be trying to emulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad reflection of ALP preselectors that they are lagging behind the other parties in affirmative action for preselection of candidates; and sadder still that they need a compulsory quota and not just an active reminder to achieve this. Paul Keating is removing the wrong barriers. I say to Mr Keating: preselection is not where those real barriers to women are. The real barriers are those factors which keep women from even entering the preselection process in the first place. The barriers are often socioeconomic and relate strongly to women usually being the prime child carer within a family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The barriers which exist for potential women candidates without children are similar to those preventing many men entering politics: there is no job security, the hours are often long, overtime is often relentless and unpaid, the job satisfaction is low and, for many, the travel, particularly to Canberra, can be prohibitive. But where a woman is the main child carer, the barriers to entering politics, particularly at a federal level, are overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal politicians often have very limited time with their children, reducing their involvement with child rearing, since even evenings and weekends are often occupied with community and party functions, even when parliament is not sitting. I commend the federal parliament and the New South Wales state parliament for the changes to the sitting hours, such that politicians of either gender can have something approaching a more normal family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this applies to a man who is the primary child carer, and this group in our community should not be overlooked. In addition, of course, it should be acknowledged that even where a parent is not the prime carer, that person does miss out on family life by entering politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, you see, Paul Keating is removing the wrong barriers and, worse, he imagines that those barriers are there only for women. The quota system he is introducing is an artifice. He does nothing to improve the journey of women who enter politics. Quotas themselves mean that preselection may not be on merit, and that in itself is demeaning and insulting to women. Real equality is a long way off but we are going towards it. Do not let us go for the short-term goal of phoney equality because the community would always wonder whether a woman had been preselected simply by virtue of her gender. That would further erode the very slim confidence people have in their parliamentary representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberal philosophy has always been one of equality of opportunity, regardless of race, age, socioeconomic class or&mdash;relevantly here&mdash;gender. Clearly, we need to make sure that, in whatever walk of life she chooses, a woman has the same options and opportunities as her male counterpart. Those are the attitudes which will also blast away the so-called glass ceiling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another significant problem to be addressed&mdash;a problem largely of the Prime Minister's own making&mdash;which deters women, and also a large number of men, with all the qualities for public life from seeking a parliamentary career. That is the contempt&mdash;that is not too strong a word&mdash;in which many politicians are held, largely as a result of the gratuitous personal denigration, gutter language and general poor behaviour exhibited by our joke of a Prime Minister. As I understand it, our personal responsibility ratings are now sinking to the same level as that of the reptiles of the press. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw it. Of course, this is a deterrent to women and men, and is a single-handed achievement&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;on the part of our Prime Minister. What needs to be done is not the ALP's tokenism but real action. Providing appropriate child-care facilities and other support, such as changes to the taxation system so there is genuine support for families, would give women a genuine choice of whether they go to work or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could be achieved through income splitting or any one of several other options. The option itself is not crucial but it is vital that something real be done to overcome what are real barriers preventing many people&mdash;men and women&mdash;from moving into public life. The ALP's puny and insulting stunt&mdash;an artificial quota for women&mdash;is not the answer. Without that quota&mdash;but by actively seeking quality candidates for preselection&mdash;the non-Labor parties will soon have 50 per cent female representation. That will be achieved on merit and without recourse to the phoney and patronising form of alleged feminism. That will be the ultimate triumph&mdash;a system where real equality does exist and where merit alone is the basis for entry into public life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on a matter to do with the report of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing. I am not going to speak for very long but I want to table some documents which I delivered today to Senator Bolkus, representing the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), and Senator Vanstone. I have further copies here for the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue which, I believe, continues unresolved within my own state of Queensland. I note that yesterday Senator Jocelyn Newman tabled a letter from the Queensland Premier which answered some of the concerns of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing. I would like to quote from the Premier's letter because I believe it raises a very important issue. In his letter the Premier says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of allegations raised by Mr Lindeberg concerning the lawfulness of redundancy payments made to Mr Coyne by the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, and the lawfulness of the destruction of documents relating to the Heiner Inquiry, the CJC concluded that there was no official misconduct involved.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing was correct when it pointed out to the Queensland government that there were apparently unresolved whistleblower cases in Queensland. I believe that one of the problems has been that much of the documentation available both to the Queensland government and to the CJC has not been considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate select committee did have some of that documentation before it. In fact, when the Premier says that there was no official misconduct involved, I believe that some of the documentation has not been considered, and that is the best construction I can put upon that particular paragraph within his letter. I will be seeking to table a number of documents which I believe the Senate needs to have before it and to have on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These documents include a transcript of a radio interview between Mr Lindeberg and Haydn Sargent on ABC radio in Brisbane which contains, I believe, an update of the issue that was the subject of concern of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing, and that is why that document needs to be on the public record. There is also a letter from Mr Lindeberg to the police commissioner which includes an attachment which is the agenda of a meeting held on 12 October. This letter raises matters with the police commissioner, who is in the process of conducting a further inquiry into possible criminal offences, and simply transfers to the police commissioner further information. I do not believe it prejudices the inquiry in any way but simply gives to the Senate information which assists its inquiry. There is also a letter from the Attorney-General to Mr Lindeberg about an FOI request which he has, and his reply to the Attorney-General. I seek leave of the Senate to table those documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other day in this place Senator Spindler raised a matter in relation to a part-time Comcar driver, Mr Dennis Reid. I thought it appropriate to make sure that the facts in this matter were very clear. Mr Reid did in fact write a letter to the paper in Queanbeyan, which letter was critical of me. That is nothing new, because I get a lot of that correspondence myself. Occasionally I see it put in the paper, and that is part of the democratic process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Spindler misses the point. The point about Mr Reid is not a point of free speech; it is a matter of trust. Comcar drivers perform a particular role which requires a high degree of trust. All of us in this place and in the other place would understand that, or at least I would hope they would understand that. Comcar drivers, by virtue of their occupation, are privy to all sorts of conversations, both on the telephone and between members of parliament or members of parliament and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty I have with Mr Reid is that I can no longer trust that what he hears in a car in which I am present will remain private and secret. That is the great difficulty and the difficulty I outlined to Comcar administration from the very start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not raise this matter with Comcar to attack Mr Reid. I have a very real concern that this man does not understand the particular position of trust in which he is placed. By his actions he has shown that he is willing to be partisan in a public forum. I do not believe that I can sit in a car which Mr Reid is driving and have a conversation with one of my colleagues secure in the knowledge that that conversation will not be repeated outside the car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest Senator Spindler or anybody else is under some misapprehension that this is some sort of party political attack on Mr Reid, let me make it very clear: I know many Comcar drivers in Canberra and Brisbane very well. Many of them, I know, are members of the Labor Party. Some of them, with whom I get on very well, are branch officials of the Labor Party, but that is not an impediment. They adhere to a very strict rule that whatever they hear in the car is absolutely confidential, and they do not make a habit of going public about their view on this, that or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Reid's case, that has not been adhered to. I know that many Comcar drivers, particularly the permanent Comcar drivers, are absolutely disgusted with Mr Reid's behaviour. The indications of support I have had about this from permanent Comcar drivers would, quite simply, astound Senator Spindler if I were to be so indiscreet as to outline them. I do not intend to do that because I intend to observe the same sort of trust and privacy which I expect Comcar drivers to observe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear that Mr Reid's behaviour is thoroughly unacceptable. What is more, it makes it very difficult for any National Party member or senator to sit in a car which Mr Reid is driving and have any confidence that what is heard or said in that car will remain confidential. That is the grave difficulty which I have and which some of my colleagues have with Mr Reid performing the functions of a Comcar driver. It is more than Senator Spindler merely running off and saying that it is a matter of free speech. It is not a matter of free speech; it is a matter of being trustworthy and being seen to be trustworthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were Mr Reid's comments in the paper erroneous and frivolous; they showed that he could not display that he was a trustworthy individual. That was what disappointed me. I think the standards of conduct that we expect of Comcar drivers are no higher than the standards of conduct that we expect and receive from many of the parliamentary servants who work in this building, be they chamber attendants, attendants in the corridors, clerks or staff in the Black Rod's Office or other people who serve us very loyally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the standard that must apply. Mr Reid has shown that he cannot abide by that standard of conduct. That is why I made the complaint, that is why I believe that the complaint is correct and that is why I would have grave reservations about Mr Reid continuing in his employment as a Comcar driver. Certainly I would not hop into a car if he were behind the wheel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, in its enthusiastic rush to republicanism and in expressing its anti-British bias, has apparently decided that British pioneers of our nation are no longer acceptable for recognition. To establish this, I refer to a letter from the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, in reply to a request from the Illawarra Historical Society to have the navy's new hydrographic office in Wollongong named the Matthew Flinders Building. The Senate will be well aware of the fact that Matthew Flinders did have some role in establishing what the coast of New South Wales was like, apart from anything else.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two hundred years ago, in 1796, Matthew Flinders and George Bass sailed in a very small boat, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tom Thumb</EMPHASIS>. They landed at Towradgi, just near Wollongong, and after some time there are said to have spent the night on the leeside of Windang Island at the entry to Lake Illawarra. The Illawarra Historical Society was hoping to celebrate that occasion in a couple of years time because it does represent 200 years of European settlement in the Illawarra. That voyage was significant, too, in terms of the discovery of coal because on that voyage Bass and Flinders observed coal sticking out of the escarpment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the request that such a renowned figure in maritime history should be remembered by having the hydrographic office in Wollongong named after him was much too offensive to the republican push for it to be acceptable. The response from the Minister for Defence has been that this matter has been discussed with the Hydrographer RAN, who has advised that there are currently no plans to name the building, which will be identified simply as the Australian Hydrographic Office, Royal Australian Navy. But Senator Ray then adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, should consideration be given in the future to the naming of this building, in accordance with current policy the name selected will be more appropriately that of an Australian who has made a significant contribution to the knowledge of our maritime environment.</PARA>
<PARA>So poor Matthew Flinders does not rate because he was a Pom. I have never heard anything more absurd. This is taking republicanism ad absurdum. Because Flinders was an Englishman, he cannot be recognised. I am one of the millions of Australians who are very proud of their British heritage. My late mother was English&mdash;although I must say that she did not support an England cricket team unless it had a Yorkshireman in it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, even though I have a continental European name. The fact is that a policy decision that Matthew Flinders cannot be recognised because he was not an Australian is an affront to the great bulk of Australians who are proud of their British heritage. I do not know what the republicanism push is all about if this is the petty way it reflects itself. Surely the government can do it a little better than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want very briefly to mention another matter which relates to the response Senator Gareth Evans gave me on Monday about the $2.2 million mansion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which he intends to lease out for rent in order to pay the enormous mortgage bill that he will face. As the Senate is aware, I am planning to put a motion before the Senate in respect of that principle of prime ministers being required to answer to somebody for actions of that kind. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is perfectly reasonable to anticipate this particular transaction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the purchase of the $2.2 million house&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">being paid for with the sale of his existing Elizabeth Bay Road property, which is worth in the order of $1 1/2 million as a result of the upgrading that has been done to it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Senator Evans's assurance to us. He is telling the Australian people, `Do not worry. The Prime Minister won't go massively into debt. He will make $1 1/2 million selling the property because of the upgrading that has been done.' That is not upgrading that has to be done; it has been done. Laurie Oakes, who obviously finds it impossible to recognise that there is a matter of principle involved in this, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The property owned by Prime Minister Keating in Elizabeth Bay is worth at least half of what he has signed up to pay for the new residence.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the $2.2 million residence. In other words, Oakes says it is worth at least $1.1 million and Senator Evans says $1 1/2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is curious because the property two doors away recently sold for $750,000 and certainly its exterior condition is better than that of Mr Keating's property. In October 1993, the property next door sold for $660,000. I do not know how Senator Gareth Evans thinks that the recent sale of a property identical to Mr Keating's for $750,000 will magically double the price of Mr Keating's property because of what he has done to it. The $1 1/2 million Mr Keating is hoping to get for his property sounds like some sort of mates price again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I think the real estate industry would be very interested to know how one could acquire such kindly benevolent purchasers who are so far out of line with the price of properties that are very similar or near identical. In a speech he made on 17 October, Senator Gareth Evans assured us that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating knows enough about the property market in Sydney to be able to make his own judgments about these things and about the affordability of this particular transaction.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. If Senator Gareth Evans is relying on Mr Keating's information about the property market, maybe he has the expectation that, because of the government's policies over the next few years, inflation is going to be so enormous that that kind of upward rush in housing prices may well take place. Maybe the Reserve Bank is correct in pressing for an increase in interest rates if the Prime Minister's own actions indicate that he is of the view that there will be a huge surge in housing prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might remind those who have been saying that if the Prime Minister spends more on his house on Elizabeth Bay Road it may well sell for more than $1.1 million, that that would involve the actual expenditure of money and, presumably, the Prime Minister would have to get that money from somewhere. So in effect it does not make any net difference to the ultimate cost to him of his $2.2 million mansion. If people really want to try to defend the Prime Minister on this matter, it would be a good idea if they stopped relying on hyperbole and wishful thinking and just looked at what sorts of prices this kind of property has actually been sold for. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer on the advice of Telecom to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am informed by Telecom that occurrences such as the May storms in Perth have the potential to generate extraordinary volumes of calls to organisations such as the State Electricity Corporation of Western Australia (SECWA). Such volumes can exceed the levels allowed for in the design of that organisation's call answering facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom advises me that during the period of the storm and its aftermath some 2 million calls were made to the SECWA emergency centre number and only a small proportion could be answered by all available SECWA operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an emergency situation, when Telecom recognises that such levels are likely to be exceeded, standard network management procedures are invoked in consultation with the organisation being affected. To prevent all the busy tones emanating from the organisation's local exchange, these procedures allow Telecom to provide a busy tone at the caller's local exchange for a proportion of the calls to that organisation's number. This procedure reduces the possibility of network congestion occurring, whilst still permitting callers to contact emergency services such as Fire, Police or Ambulance. These steps were taken by Telecom in consultation with the SECWA management on the occasion of the Perth storms on 23 May this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Telecom advises that the Telecom network continued to operate satisfactorily enabling all other callers to contact emergency services during this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Telecom advises that the Standard Network Management procedures that were invoked by Telecom on 23 May 1994, were undertaken in consultation with the SECWA management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) &amp; (5) Telecom advises that when its customers such as SECWA have difficulty in handling a large volume of calls, Telecom believes that it is SECWA's responsibility to inform the public if such action is considered to be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Telecom advises that its network has adequate capacity to deal with crises such as the May storms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) I am advised by Telecom that it is satisfied that the capacity of the Telecom network was sufficient to deal with this emergency. It is Telecom's understanding that SECWA has reviewed its emergency call operator procedures and resource plans after the May 1994 experience.</PARA>
