<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;We have no problems with the obligation of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to be at the five-power defence conference, and we obviously regret that Senator Cook is unwell. But I do raise the issue of Senator Bolkus's absence. The Senate has been up for a fortnight. No doubt Senator Bolkus had a few days at the Cairo conference and now he needs to be away for another week as well. Why can he not plan his program between parliamentary sittings? Even the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) attempts to do that. Why can Senator Bolkus not do the same thing?</PARA></TALK.START>

But the people of Australia actually think that ministers ought to be here during parliamentary sittings and ought to be prepared to answer questions. Therefore, Mr President, I would suggest that we should expect of the Leader of the Government in the Senate a better explanation as to why Senator Bolkus could not fit his program within the two weeks that the Senate was up. </PARA>

I refer to the national maritime strike, which cost the nation an estimated $60 million and which put what seems to be an indefinite obligation on consolidated revenue as a result of the government's capitulation to the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farming in Australia has never been easy, but for about 12,000 out of a total of 125,000 farming families in Australia it has never been tougher than it is at the moment. In fact, in parts of Queensland we have to go back to 1911 before we can find a comparable period of extended drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Core areas of Queensland and New South Wales have now been laid waste by extreme drought, directly affecting at this stage, as I have said, about 12,000 of Australia's 125,000 farming families. I regret to say that the drought has stalled what would otherwise have been a strong recovery in the rural sector. One only has to look at the wool price which, on its own, has put about $1 billion back into the rural equation, to see the truth of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE has provided an analysis of the drought's effects on farm incomes and the economy. I met with ABARE last week on this issue. The severity of the Queensland-New South Wales drought is most clearly demonstrated when one looks at the likely financial position of droughted farms. Average farm cash income for broadacre farms in Queensland in 1994-95 is expected to fall by around 15 per cent to just over $33,000, with an estimated 38 per cent expected to suffer negative income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, average farm income is expected to fall by 56 per cent to just over $19,000, with 26 per cent of farms expected to have negative incomes. Hardest hit will be the crop and beef industries, although the dry conditions are also now having an adverse impact on the quality of this season's spring lambs with saleyard prices expected to fall as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE estimates that the drought has cut total Australian winter crop production, including wheat, barley, legumes and so on, by 40 per cent to around 17 million tonnes in total. The drought will result in a reduction in the net value of agriculture production of around $1.3 billion in 1994-95, with a forecast loss of about $450 million in exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The volume of rural exports is forecast to decline by around six per cent but this is expected to be largely off-set by higher commodity prices. On balance, the value of rural commodity exports is forecast by ABARE to be around $19.1 billion this financial year, which is largely unchanged from 1993-94. As I have said, a lot of that can be attributed to the increase in the price for wool alone. The reduction in Australia's national income as a result of the drought is estimated at around $2 billion, equivalent to a drop of half a percentage point in the economic growth this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable media speculation about the effects of drought on consumer prices. Mr President, the drought may increase the price of fruit, vegetables, lamb, pigs, poultry and cereal, but beef and mutton prices can be expected to fall in the short term. ABARE has, in fact, advised me that significant inflationary pressures are unlikely as a result of the drought, given the presence of considerable spare capacity in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the forecasts I have just given are based on two assumptions: that the drought will persist in Queensland and New South Wales to the end of this year and will be followed by a poor and late summer rain consistent with the El Nino phenomenon; and that the remaining states will receive below average rainfall this spring. Given that the drought is on-going, the actual impact on the Australian economy will depend in part on the extent of the final reduction in farm production. It is obvious that, in this sense, the only solution to the drought is rain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the wider Australian community, I must say, is responding magnificently to the plight of the worst hit farmers through the national Farm Hand appeal, which the Prime Minister has pledged to match dollar for dollar. The Prime Minister clearly articulated this government's position during his trip to droughted areas in Queensland this year, when he said that the government will respond positively to this crisis. Indeed, I will be taking a submission to cabinet this Wednesday on the matter.</PARA>

It was the minister who did such huge damage to the value of the company by saying it was a `couldn't give away at any price' company. The minister has not attempted to answer my question, so I put it to him again: firstly, how much does the government now believe the company to be worth, and why the change in three weeks?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question because today is a very significant step towards increasing the system and support for people with breast cancer. Today is the first ever Australian Breast Cancer Day. We know how serious this disease is. Every day, it is estimated that six women die of breast cancer. That means that every day six families are shattered by the death of women in the family. We know that women have a one in 15 chance of developing breast cancer. I believe there is a fairly united and agreed position that breast cancer is one of the most serious causes for concern that governments should be looking at in terms of protecting women's health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still do not know what causes breast cancer. There is certainly a difference of opinion about what is the best treatment. That is why this government's program for breast cancer is so comprehensive and why this day joins that program as a very significant extra part of the link. The Commonwealth government has provided funding of $150,000 to assist with the costs of this first Australian Breast Cancer Day. What the day will do is twofold. Firstly, it will focus on breast cancer and the importance of increasing research. Secondly, it will encourage the community to contribute to fund raising for breast cancer research, because as well as providing money for the day, the government is prepared to match each dollar raised with another dollar, up to $1 million a year from the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to provide the community with information about the incidence of breast cancer, early detection of the disease and alternative and better ways of treatment, as well as the benefits of breast cancer screening. In establishing this breast cancer day, I also have to announce that today the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, announced a further major initiative: the establishment of the Kathleen Cunningham Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which will raise funds for further research by joining public funding with private funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The patron of that research foundation will be Mrs Annita Keating. I am delighted that she is so willing to put her support behind this very important area. The foundation is named after Kathleen Cunningham, a little known pioneer who helped establish the breast cancer clinic at Sydney's Rachel Forster Hospital in 1950&mdash;one of the many unsung heroines around this country. It will be a very good thing that we acknowledge her contribution through the naming of this foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has pledged $1 million a year for three years to this foundation and is prepared to match up to $1 million for every dollar raised by things like the first ever breast cancer day and other ways in which funding can be raised. This government's contribution to breast cancer research has been very significantly increased, particularly over the last budget. We have a comprehensive program of managing breast cancer&mdash;not just increased research funding but also increased funding for raising more dollars for research and, in particular, looking at better ways in which we can make sure that treatment is appropriate, contemporary&mdash;that is, up to date&mdash;and effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jury is still out on the best way of treating breast cancer. We know the importance of more research and that more evidence is needed&mdash;not just pure research about the cause of breast cancer but the sort of research that justifies and follows the best way to treat breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this first ever Australian Breast Cancer Day, the patron of which is Annita Keating, will go a long way to further focus the community on the need for money for research into breast cancer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 14 September where the minister is quoted as saying that he `would be concerned if universities around Australia followed the Australian National University's lead and charged for professional training diplomas', and that the ANU `should have been prepared to look sensibly at the circumstances in this particular exercise'. Will the government itself `look sensibly at the circumstances' and revise the HECS and fees administration guidelines so that universities are discouraged from following this lead, that is, charging for professional training diplomas? Is it not the case that the `circumstances' are that the government has manipulated tertiary funding and allowed the universities to charge such fees and that the government has encouraged the universities to adopt a corporate view of the world, considering education as a product and students as clients, thereby actively encouraging this very outcome of government policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Australian Democrats or anybody else should try to make any criticism of our policies on tertiary education based on the HECS policy, which has been very successful. The government has no intention of changing the policy about HECS, so we should put that to bed immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by Minister Crean that the decision for the ANU to charge this fee was entirely a decision for the university. The attempt to represent this move as something that was forced on the university by the government is nonsense. In fact, a recent letter from the ANU Vice-Chancellor to Simon Crean categorically states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no stage did the council consider it was taking this action as a direct consequence of government actions or policies in relation to the university.</PARA>
<PARA>As my colleague Mr Crean has previously stated, the facts of the situation are that the government's decision to deregulate postgraduate fees was taken after strong pressure from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the AVCC, on which all universities were represented, including the ANU. The new arrangements do not affect the overall level of Commonwealth financial commitment to higher education. Total funding for higher education will increase from $4.86 billion in 1994 to $5.02 billion in 1996. In fact, Commonwealth funding of higher education will increase in real terms by 42 per cent between 1988 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government funding for postgraduate courses at the ANU is increasing. Between 1994 and 1996 the Commonwealth will fund growth from 995 to 1,030 full-time postgraduate places. Some reports have incorrectly indicated that there is a link between the introduction of the fee and a fall in the ANU's research funding. This fall of about $1.5 million represents only 0.8 per cent of the ANU's operating funds from the Commonwealth. This resulted from a national reapplication of research funds according to a formula which reflects actual research performance. Once again this was agreed with the AVCC. The sole responsibility for the decision to introduce this fee at the ANU and the level at which it is set lies with the ANU.</PARA>

Obviously this is a direct indication of how well they are not working. In answering the question the minister missed the point that it is the government's conditions and the manipulation of the financial situation that has led the universities to take this step. Minister Crean suggested that it would be wrong if other universities followed.

In assessing applications for woodchip export licences, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy examines proposals to assess their environmental impact and seeks advice from agencies in the environment portfolio.

That may be a condition that Senator Chamarette would not agree with, but that is the way it is done. The Minister for Resources noted that in the licences he had approved, high conservation value areas were not included.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of some criticism recently about the implementation by the government of the Beddall report&mdash;namely, from Mrs Judi Moylan, the shadow minister for small business. Recently she made a statement criticising the fact that the government in her view had not carried through the recommendations of the Beddall report. I have to say that Mrs Moylan, who has been in the job only a short time, has made a number of mistakes, this, unfortunately, being one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Beddall report&mdash;the committee was chaired by Mr David Beddall, who then became the Minister for Small Business&mdash;made 66 recommendations, 58 of which have been carried out. The only recommendation rejected outright by the government was one stating that there should be a new peak body established to represent small business in Australia. This was rejected because Australian small business organisations were totally opposed to such a new structure. The government accepted their advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We worked with small business to establish a small business forum. The 31 small business organisations represented there meet two or three times a year with me and other government ministers to discuss in a very constructive way issues that affect small business. Also, as a result of the effectiveness of the small business forum the small business community has established a small business coalition of 40-odd groups to discuss issues affecting the small business community. Again this has proved to be very effective in putting ideas forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent example of this is the ideas the small business coalition put forward for the industry component of the Working Nation statement. We received several hundred suggestions from the small business community, and most of the suggestions taken up by the government reflect that input from small business. It is a very constructive working relationship. When the Working Nation statement was published the small business coalition put out a statement welcoming the initiatives in that statement and congratulating the government on showing the sensitivity to understand many of the issues that small business was raising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is in contrast to the efforts of the coalition. The most extraordinary effort of all in recent times was that of a previous shadow minister for small business, Mr Alexander Downer, who, in February 1989, issued a statement saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition has launched a nationwide small business campaign in Melbourne today which will involve the aggressive marketing of Coalition policies and values to the small business sector, Shadow Minister for Housing and Small Business Alexander Downer announced today.</PARA>

<PARA>There is no record of any such forums taking place or of any statements being released by the then shadow minister, which explains why in May 1989, when there was a change in the leadership of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Peacock as the new leader sacked Alexander Downer as the shadow minister for small business. Mr Downer returned to the back bench, which makes it surprising that only in the last couple of days Mr Downer has said that Andrew Peacock has been `a great friend of mine and we've had a close association over many years.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I am aware that there has been recent media speculation alleging the use of drugs by some swimmers and that that has been a key reason for the success of those particular swimmers at the World Swimming Championships in Rome. I am also aware that there have been some slurs suggesting that our own swimmers' success in Canada and Rome&mdash;which has been exceptional&mdash;has also been connected with drug use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia can be confident that its swimmers have achieved their success drug free. The Australian Sports Drug Agency conducts a stringent testing program year round with out-of-competition tests totalling 55 per cent of its 2,802 tests over the past year. This testing program is fully accountable to the parliament of Australia and to those countries and international sports organisations which wish to come here and scrutinise ASDA's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you can be assured that this government condemns the use of performance enhancing substances in sport. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is recognised internationally as a world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. I am concerned that most other countries do not have similar programs and, in particular, that the international swimming federation, FINA, does not implement an equally reputable testing program. The lack of such a program creates doubt in people's minds when athletes break records and perform exceptionally. That, of course, occurs at a time when we should all be praising the athletes for their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that finger pointing helps this situation. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is keen to work with FINA, as it does with a number of other international federations, to assist in initiatives to reduce the use of drugs in sport. For example, the agency is about to sign an agreement with the International Amateur Athletics Federation to assist in implementing its out-of-competition testing program. The agency is working with the International Weightlifting Federation to rewrite its anti-doping policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in full support of those initiatives. It is unfortunate that FINA, the international swimming federation, has not yet been as willing to work with ASDA and its international colleagues. I will certainly be writing to FINA in the near future to encourage it to use the expertise that has been developed by ASDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, honourable senators would be aware that there has been some criticism of Chinese swimmers. In regard to that public criticism, the agency is also establishing a working relationship with its Chinese counterparts. In July the agency hosted a visit by a Chinese anti-doping delegation. I met with the delegation, whose members told me they were very impressed with the Australian program and were keen to set up a similar program in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the outcomes of the visit was an undertaking to draft an anti-doping agreement between ASDA and the Chinese Olympic committee's anti-doping commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Burns this day, relating to the economic impact of the drought in the eastern States.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins, in his answer, focused totally on the effects of the economy. We heard about the impact the drought is having on the GDP; we heard about the effects on the export incomes; we heard about the impact on various crops. That is all very important. We are facing a situation where many of our rural products are being devastated and so the national economy is losing potential income. What the minister very carefully skirted around, however, was the sheer human misery that has been created by what is possibly the worst drought this century&mdash;not only on the farms, where the direct effect is on 10,000 families, but also in the towns that those farms support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these families need is immediate cash aid. This came home very clearly, I am sure, to everyone in this chamber when Ray Martin conducted the `Farm Hand&mdash;Best for the Bush' concert. During that night we heard countless stories of the hardship that has been caused by this drought. The Australian people, in their usual generosity, responded magnificently and $3 1/2 million was raised on that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is to the eternal shame of this government that it took that sort of a response to spur it into some sort of action. Where has the government been on this issue for the last four years? We have in some areas of the country eight crops in succession failing. Yet when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gets out of his very comfortable surroundings in the Lodge and in Kirribilli House, where does he tend to go? He does not very often go out the back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was acting shadow minister for regional development in July, I was in North Queensland, where the Prime Minister was talking to groups in Cairns and Townsville. On national radio I challenged him to leave Cairns and Townsville and go out the back to Longreach and see what is happening and how people are suffering from this drought. That went unheeded. But he would have flown over that sort of territory to get to Cairns and Townsville. I flew over it on a clear day&mdash;it was very clear because droughts tend to do that&mdash;and I could see the devastating effect on the land and how the rivers were not flowing and algae blooms were developing. He did not necessarily need to be on the ground to see that. That should have been enough to shock him into action. But it was not until we had the Farm Hand concert that this government, in its very slow way, proposed to do something about it. So we will await with great interest what the government does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote an open letter in the paper to Minister Baldwin indicating the sorts of social security measures that he should be adopting on the drought at this time. I would be very interested to see whether the cabinet submission of Minister Collins and what comes out of it on Wednesday contain any of those measures, because what is desperately needed in our rural areas at this time is cash income support. Everyone else in Australia who loses a job or does not have any means of support is quite entitled to some sort of benefit from the government. This government has refused to recognise that we do not have a normal drought that can be provided for by prudent financial management. We have an extraordinary situation that no prudent measures could account for. On that basis, the government should provide income support for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict the government will not do it, and the reason is twofold: firstly, it will blow out the unemployment figures; and, secondly, it will blow out a budget that is already huge. But why should these people not be entitled to this sort of income support? Today I plead with the government on behalf of these people who have no cash flow, no income at all, that during this extraordinary drought&mdash;the worst this century and probably the worst since European civilisation&mdash;it do the right thing by these people and give them the support that other Australians are entitled to receive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to standing order 81, Senator Vanstone has raised with me a matter of privilege. The matter raised by Senator Vanstone relates to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, of which she is the deputy chair. Senator Vanstone states that on two occasions there have been significant unauthorised disclosures of private deliberations of the committee and false and misleading accounts of the committee's decisions. She indicates that these unauthorised disclosures and false and misleading accounts were extremely damaging to the committee's work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unauthorised disclosures of committee proceedings and false and misleading accounts of such proceedings are declared by the privilege resolutions of the Senate to be contempts, and as such they are taken very seriously. There is no doubt that supported allegations of such offences meet the criteria which I am required to consider under standing order 81, and therefore a motion to refer such a matter to the Privileges Committee would normally be given precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, a difficulty with the matter raised by Senator Vanstone. Although she asks that the Privileges Committee be required to consider whether contempts have been committed `by anyone', it is clear that it is the chairman of the committee, Mr Cleeland, who stands accused of making the unauthorised disclosures of committee deliberations and of giving the false and misleading accounts of the committee's proceedings. The press reports obtaining the alleged unauthorised disclosures and false and misleading statements explicitly cite Mr Cleeland as their source. While it is theoretically possible that the journalist concerned falsely claimed Mr Cleeland as his source, Senator Vanstone's letter makes it clear that this is not the case. An inquiry by the Privileges Committee, therefore, would inevitably be an inquiry into the conduct of Mr Cleeland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very similar case was raised in May 1988 when a senator who was the deputy chair of a joint committee, the Joint Select Committee on Video Materials, raised as a matter of privilege alleged false and misleading accounts of the committee's proceedings by the chair of the committee, who was a member of the House of Representatives. President Sibraa declined to give a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee precedence, on the basis that the Senate has no power to inquire into or to treat as a contempt the conduct of a member of the House of Representatives, and only that House can inquire into the conduct of one of its members or deal with one of its members for contempt. President Sibraa based his ruling on this principle by referring to paragraph (b) of the criteria required to be considered under standing order 81. Paragraph (b) requires the President to have regard to the availability of another remedy, and President Sibraa ruled that action by the House of Representatives was the only remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may not have precedence under standing order 81. In accordance with the normal practice, I table the letter from Senator Vanstone in which she raises the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am somewhat amazed by your response, but not the remarks that you make which point out that to the extent that there is a breach of privilege by a member of another place it has to be dealt with by the other place. As you indicate, that was confirmed in 1988. I ask you to consider that in my letter to you I made no allegation that it was Mr Cleeland who was the perpetrator of this breach. All I pointed out was that there were articles in the paper mentioning Mr Cleeland under the by-line, more often than not, of Mr Daly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By responding in this way, what I gather you have done is conclude that Mr Daly, the journalist, has not misreported anything he was told and has not committed any breach of contempt; you have concluded that Mr Cleeland did. I do not want to ambush you with that argument, Mr President, but the situation is that we have a joint committee on the National Crime Authority. I think he whom we sometimes refer to as `leaking Loosley' is a member, although he has not attended very much lately. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosley to me, but `leaking Loosley' to anyone who has been on a committee with him. The committee has had serious problems over a considerable time. There are very good reasons for having privilege watched very carefully in these committees; we cannot expect members of the public to come forward and give information if they think that information will be in the paper the next day. We cannot expect parliamentary committees to work if that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, with a fairly objective mind, I wrote to you, Mr President, and said that this is what has happened. I sent you some of the clippings and indicated what had happened as a consequence of these matters being raised publicly. I now read in the paper that we have decided to have inquiries that we have not decided to have; I now read about confidential letters that have been sent to the Premier of Victoria, and inappropriate remarks by somebody that our committee had asked him to put up or shut up&mdash;which was not at all the tenor of the letter that was sent. Clearly, something has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has Mr Cleeland been breaching privilege as chairman of this committee, and feeling free to speak to the media saying, `I am chairman of the committee; this is my personal view,' knowing that this would clearly be written up as `Mr Cleeland, chairman of the committee'? Is that the case? Mr Cleeland does not admit that he has breached privilege. By inference he says, `The journalist has misquoted me; the journalist has done the wrong thing; the journalist has made the story up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it seems to me that we cannot leave this matter here. We do not need to argue about it today, but it needs to be considered for the future&mdash;not that I would like you to come back any time you like; I would like to hear from you soon about this matter. As a matter of practice for how we handle such things in the future, it raises the question: if, when someone writes to us and says that a House of Representatives person or a journalist&mdash;or both&mdash;on a joint committee has committed a breach of privilege, and we write back and say that it has to go to the House of Representatives, the implication is that it must be the House of Representatives member. I have not spoken to the journalist so I cannot conclude that this was done by a House of Representatives member. I do not know whether you have spoken to the journalist, Mr President, and can therefore conclude that. </PARA>

They seem to have some remarkable similarity to and matching up with what is happening in the committee; but there are some divergences that seem to match Mr Cleeland's personal preferences. Maybe the journalist is divining this stuff out of thin air. Maybe he is an evil journalist who should be scrubbed out. That is the question I put to you, Mr President. Why do you infer that this breach must be a breach by Mr Cleeland and not by the journalist or, for that matter, another member of the committee? Why do you refuse to have this matter looked at? There is clearly a breach of privilege of a committee that is administered by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I accept what you say, that perhaps we cannot inquire into a breach of privilege by a House of Representatives member. But we can ascertain whether or not it was anybody else. It would soon point the finger if we came to the conclusion that it was not anybody else, that Mr Daly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> is a responsible journalist who does not make up stories and that he is just the poor schmuck wearing the blame because Cleeland or someone else chooses to say, `Oh, the journalist misquoted me.'

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Determination makes changes to prosthetic items and benefits on the existing basic health insurance table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that parts of the determination are made retrospective to 30 March 1994 because, if this was not done, patients who have received benefits for items listed and patients who have undergone procedures where new prosthetic items were not listed, would be financially disadvantaged. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the apparently prejudicial retrospective effect on hospitals and day hospital facilities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment operates retrospectively for almost four years, to 1 July 1990.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 189</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Regulations prescribe types of benefits which will be taken to be annuities and pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide in clause 1 of Schedule 1B for an apparent subdelegation of legislative power to the Commissioner. As such, this appears to be invalid. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on validity and whether there is provision for the written arrangements to be tabled in Parliament and to be subject to possible disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 197</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Regulations provide for evidentiary certificates and for evidence to be given by affidavit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on an apparent lack of safeguard provisions, which appears to breach the rights of those affected by the evidentiary certificates. Such provisions have been included in numbers of similar regulations which provide for the use of such certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Classification of Publications (Amendment) Ordinance ACT Ordinance No 5 of 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Ordinance retrospectively provides for the imposition and collection of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 28AB of the principal Ordinance is amended to impose a nine years retrospective liability to pay fees, with any such payments made since that date taken to discharge that liability. The Explanatory Statement gives the background and reasons for the amendments. The retrospectivity appears to be valid under the parent Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1990. The Committee has written to the Minister, however, seeking advice on the legislative and administrative considerations which dictated the retrospective liability and the apparent simultaneous discharge of that liability. In particular, the Committee has asked whether, in the absence of this retrospectivity, any fees paid between 1 April 1985 and 22 June 1994 would have to be refunded, and if so, what amounts are involved.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 March 1994 the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, introduced the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994. The purpose of the bill was to `provide for the Federal Court to enforce lawful orders made by Parliament, and to allow the Court to determine claims that disclosure of information to Parliament would contravene the public interest'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 May, the bill was referred to the Committee of Privileges for examination, with a reporting date of 23 August 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 June, a further matter was referred in the context of the committee's examination of the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of Privileges, having considered all the evidence before it, does not accept the concept that jurisdiction in respect of the determination of claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity against a house of parliament or its committees should be conferred on the courts. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the bill be not proceeded with. It also considers that, if an order of a house or committee is not complied with by a public servant acting on the instructions of a minister, it is for the relevant house to take such action under its contempt powers as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for these unanimous views is that, as all witnesses affirmed, the ultimate power to determine claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity lies with each house of the parliament and should remain so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Australian Democrats accept the recommendation of the Committee of Privileges that the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill presented by me be not proceeded with. The Democrats put up this bill as one possible solution to the impasses which seemed to be regularly occurring between the parliament and the executive over the supply of government documents. We did not see it as the last word on the issue and we have been persuaded by weight of argument that these matters should be determined by parliament itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I take issue with the second last paragraph of the committee's tabling statement which says that the ultimate power to determine claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity lies with each house of parliament. It might seem that way but the fact is that the power to determine claims of public interest immunity lies exclusively with the executive. Possession is nine-tenths of the law and the government possesses the documents. To my knowledge, no government has ever submitted documents to a house of parliament to allow that house to determine whether or not the document should be made public. To claim that the ultimate power lies with the parliament is at odds with the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the Democrats have decided to take government and opposition senators at their word. I will be proposing a procedure for parliament to determine this government's claims of public interest immunity in respect of the Fairfax documents to which the print media committee was denied access. The proposal is for a select committee of parliamentary party leaders&mdash;currently Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Hill and myself&mdash;to examine the documents in strict confidence and to report to the Senate on whether they should be disclosed. The committee could seek the advice of consultants or witnesses&mdash;again, in strict confidence. The Democrats envisage seeking the advice of a respected former judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I anticipate government criticism when I say that this proposal is designed to prevent a hijacking or political witch-hunt by non-government members. Prior to the committee's report being tabled, the documents would be returned to the government and the Senate would have a firm basis on which to decide what further steps to take. In our view, the government would have no justification for refusing to supply documents to a committee of parliamentary leaders. We would regard non-cooperation as a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore foreshadow that at the conclusion of this debate I will seek leave of the Senate to give two notices of motion: one to discharge my bill from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and the other to establish a committee of party leaders to determine the government's claim of public interest immunity in respect of the Fairfax documents. </PARA>

But he added, "Coercive techniques can readily be devised on paper to ensure that ministers do in fact give evidence to rival-chamber committees on demand or request, but the real question is whether any such system will be workable in political practice. I doubt that it ever can be, but the remedy is evident: write the report anyway on the basis of the material available to the committee, and let the facts speak for themselves."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While he did not believe that any of these problems were "ever going to be fully solved", a good deal could "be achieved by the committees themselves resolutely determining that they are simply not going to be treated with contempt by ministers or senior officials".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, on behalf of the coalition I endorse the report of the Committee of Privileges. This report relates to the reference to the committee by the Senate of the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994. The reference required the committee to particularly look into the problems displayed on recent occasions when the government failed to comply with orders and requests of the Senate and its committees for documents and information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, I refer to the following: the order of the Senate dated 16 December 1993 concerning ministerial communications on woodchip licences; the request for evidence by the Select Committee on the Australian Loan Council; and the request for documents in evidence by the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media. It was perhaps that latter committee of inquiry that was the catalyst, as Senator Kernot put it, for this bill to be brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have regarded this reference as being purely politically motivated because it wanted to carry forward the terms of reference of the print media inquiry. It was not that at all. That committee highlighted an entirely unsatisfactory situation where the executive arm of government was thumbing its nose at a due process of inquiry by this Senate and its committee. One has to remember that the Senate is an elected house. It represents the states and thereby the citizens of Australia. The committee process of the Senate is a very important one. Anything that would thwart the good operation of that committee process strikes at the fabric of democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is understandable that Senator Kernot brought forward such a bill as this. The purpose of the bill was to provide for the Federal Court to enforce lawful orders made by parliament and to allow the court to determine claims that disclosure of information to parliament would contravene the public interest. The questions that the bill is designed to resolve are: whether there should be a method of determining a claim for executive privilege against a house of parliament; on what basis the claim should be determined; and whether the determination of the claim should reside within either of the two institutions, that is, the parliament or the executive, or whether recourse should be had to the third arm of government, that is, the judiciary. That was really the nub of the reference&mdash;to look at the aspect of the bill which placed the determination of this matter in the hands of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several submissions were received on the detail of the bill. However, the primary focus of the evidence was on the fundamental constitutional framework of our system of government. I recommend to fellow senators that they read the transcript of the hearing which took place. I commend my fellow senators on the committee for the work they did and the questions which they put to the witnesses concerned, because I believe that through that evidence there was an expose of the fundamental problems highlighted by this whole affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the committee acknowledged, as did all witnesses who appeared before it, I believe, that there is some information held by an executive which should not be disclosed. However, to put it rather bluntly, as Mr Morris QC did, it is all a question of trust. He noted that, in an ideal world, a government could be trusted not to make a claim of public interest immunity inappropriately, while in the event that a claim needed to be considered because of some ambiguity or uncertainty a house or committee of the parliament could be trusted with such information so that a determination could properly and confidentially be made. Of course, in reality, it seems to be somewhat different. I note Senator Kernot's previous remarks regarding her proposal to sort out this question of whether such immunity is validly claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tension between a government's decision to withhold information and the Senate's insistence on its production, I believe, has not been satisfactorily resolved. I believe that is echoed in terms of the report by the committee. The question posed by the committee was whether any solution was possible and in what form that solution might be successfully canvassed. According to the report, the former Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Dr Coghill, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern is that the legislation is ultimately repugnant to the responsibilities of the parliament, and to the Senate in particular, in our system of government. To my mind the referral of such matters to a court would undermine the authority of the parliament and politicise the court's proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>That was really the tenor of the majority of evidence put to the committee, I would suggest. Perhaps the gravity of the situation was best covered by the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, if parliament fails, the whole system is likely to fail. There is simply no substitute for an inquisitive legislature . . . We have had a string of royal commissions telling us that all manner of dreadful things have gone on, that parliaments have been powerless to prevent them and have been negligent in their duties, et cetera, and that we need more safeguards, like independent commissions against corruption and all manner of things like that to prevent these things happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still say that all these things will not work in the absence of a properly operating parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse that last sentence especially, because democracy in this country cannot function as it should unless there is a properly functioning parliament and that parliament is one of an inquisitive nature&mdash;it inquires on behalf of the people of this country into the operations of government, and it does that largely via its committee system. The Senate committee system has so much going for it because it offers that avenue of inquiry for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem, of course, is that if the committee is to be met with contentious behaviour, if the committee is to run into a stone wall where public servants, directed by ministers, do not answer questions or do not provide essential documents to that inquiry, what is the worth of that committee system? What is the worth of this chamber being an inquisitive chamber into the workings of government? It reduces that worth to nought, and that is really why this problem is so essential. It is one which is not going to go away. It is one which will remain. People who follow in my shoes and in the shoes of others in this chamber in years to come will still be asking the question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope we do solve it but perhaps Senator Kernot is more optimistic than I because this matter is one that has been a longstanding question and a vexed one. Again, I refer to the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has enormous powers to force a government to disgorge information but there are great political constraints on the use of those powers.</PARA>
<PARA>The witnesses concerned indicated that there were great powers placed in the hands of this chamber and the other place and that ultimately it rested with the Senate to deal with how its committees were treated and how it was treated by the government of the day. Of course, the witnesses concerned agreed, I would suggest, that there was a problem to be looked at here but that a referral to the courts was not the answer. That was the aspect of the bill which provided much food for thought and perhaps some dissension from the witnesses concerned. Nonetheless, no-one underrated the problem that we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Senate that the Committee of Privileges has given a report, albeit a somewhat pithy report, which outlines succinctly the problem concerned. In its recommendations, the committee stated that it does not accept the concept that jurisdiction in respect of the determination of claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity against a house of parliament or its committees should be conferred on the courts. I concur with that. It recommended that the bill not be proceeded with. It also considered that if an order of a house or committee is not complied with by a public servant acting on the instructions of a minister, it is for the relevant house to take such action under its contempt powers as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. That last recommendation is really the nub of the whole matter. It is for this chamber to decide what action should be taken. The buck stops here; nowhere else. We are the elected representatives of the people of Australia and we have to take responsibility for dealing with people who treat our committees and this chamber with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my view that we should not shirk from that responsibility, should that arise in the future. It is a question of degree as to the extent of the contempt, the extent of the obstructive behaviour. That is one that will have to be determined on the day. Unfortunately, we are all political animals and we are subject to outside influences&mdash;the influences of public opinion. Perhaps that might influence us in how robust we are in handling any contemptuous behaviour or any stonewalling on the part of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that during the print media inquiry there were sensationalist headlines as to the gaoling of a public servant. It was never contemplated&mdash;unless the journalists were at a different committee hearing from me. But I can say to the chamber that that was not the issue. The issue is: what do we do when we need essential documents for a duly constituted Senate committee of inquiry and we are being obstructed; someone is saying in front of us, `No, you can't have those documents'? It was not about gaoling public servants. But the question has to be answered and resolved, not by gaoling public servants but by putting forward a sensible and rational proposal which will address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this chamber and the government, especially the latter, would be remiss in its responsibilities and duties if it did not address this problem; it is fundamental to the system of government in this country. One can talk about all manner of things&mdash;republics, monarchs and all the rest&mdash;but that is the cosmetic aspect to it all. We are talking about the nitty gritty aspects of government, of a system of government, and when one gets into the detail of a problem, one finds that many people shy away from addressing it. It is easy to address the cosmetics. It is easy to indulge in rhetoric on this but the question still remains. We have to find an answer to this problem so that this Senate and its committees can function properly whereby inquiries that are carried out on behalf of the people of Australia can be carried out in a proper fashion and in an effective manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to conclude my remarks on clause 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994. I wish to address the question of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights which upholds the principle of voluntary association, that is, the individual's right to choose whether to belong to an association or a body. I wanted to reiterate the point that the government and those who sympathise with the government so often rely on United Nations' conventions and declarations of this sort when it suits them; but in this case, where it does not suit them, they choose not to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This declaration, specifically, would support voluntary student associations, the voluntary membership of a student organisation or union. I wish to make it abundantly clear that there is a discrepancy here, and one could almost question the motives of those people behind it. I do not seek to rely on that declaration because I believe that the principles of liberalism going back to 1688 and thereabouts have always enshrined the freedom of the individual and freedom of association which are essential tenets of Australian society. So I do not believe that we have to go beyond the shores of this country to look for any principles other than fairness and freedom as that is what it all boils down to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wished to address was the question of providing services to students. During the course of this debate it has not been demonstrated where student services would be improved by levying students compulsorily in relation to their membership of a student association or union. No study has been undertaken to show this, and I challenge those people who say that services to students would be improved to give us the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it not be reasonable to assume that, if one had competition on the campuses by those people who provide the services, such as food, beverages and other sorts of supportive services akin to that, one might even get a more efficient service delivered to the students rather than one which relied on a dollar which was provided by the government, a dollar which was certain, and a dollar which did not have to be worked for? That is the question I pose in relation to those who say that this is so essential to student services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the end of the day it really is a question of how free we want Australia to be. Do we want students to have a choice whether to belong to their associations or not? Do we want students to have a choice to judge whether their associations are worth joining or not? If those associations were doing the job, the students would join them; it is as simple as that. But this seeks to circumvent that whole aspect of choice by taking the money from the states and giving it straight to the student associations involved. This bill seeks to give taxpayers' money without any qualms whatsoever to these student associations to then apply as they think fit. That, really, is the nub of the question: the question of freedom of association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn my attention to two matters which need to be addressed in this second reading debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994. Firstly, there is the issue relating to clause 15, an issue which my friend and colleague Senator Ellison has most eloquently referred to. It relates to the form of bribery, if not extortion, that the federal government, particularly the minister responsible, is seeking to use over states that legislate to give young Australians what should be their birth right, and that is the right to decide of their own free will when they turn up on a tertiary campus somewhere around Australia whether or not they will join a student union. Of course very few young Australians have that choice at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ellison and I know that in our home state Norman Frederick Moore, the Minister for Education, is legislating through the state parliament to ensure that young Western Australians have that freedom when they turn up at campus in 1994. This government would ensure that the taxpayers of Western Australia are beaten around the head when that legislation comes into effect. I want to inform the Senate of the effect of this legislation if we do not amend it and withdraw this particularly nasty clause&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pernicious.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This pernicious clause, which would, of course, hurt all Australian taxpayers but, more particularly, hurt the cause of student unionism on campus. For those who have not followed the debate over the last couple of weeks, the federal government is proposing, where a state government allows students to make up their minds as to whether they join a union and, as a consequence of that, a student union suffers a loss of revenue, to take away funds from that state to the level of that revenue. My understanding of the bill&mdash;I may be wrong because I have not read it for a while&mdash;is that it is at the minister's discretion as to exactly what that amount is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an odious piece of legislation and a particularly nasty clause. It will ensure that if a student union, particularly a voluntary union, which is the best union, behaves abominably, puts itself offside with the majority of the student body and ends up with only half a dozen members, it is possible for the federal education minister to give grants to that union to keep it solvent, and the taxpayers of Australia will therefore make up that subsidy. So we could create the position whereby a student union with only a dozen members in a campus of 10,000 could be given millions of dollars&mdash;it is probably a hypothetical and extreme example but it is quite possible under this legislation&mdash;of taxpayers' money to subsidise its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course that rather extreme example of what can happen under the federal government's proposals points to the more likely scenario that student unions will become out of touch with their student body. They will not be responsive to their needs but will become responsive to the needs of the federal government and, indeed, the federal government will gain de facto control of student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a speech that I gave on this subject at the Murdoch University in my state of Western Australia the week before last, I had a very earnest debate with the president of that student union, someone who is of the Left political persuasion. He is certainly not a member of our party. I am not even sure whether he is a member of the Australian Labor Party. I think he might be further to the Left than that. He may even be a Democrat. The point he made when we were discussing these issues&mdash;he is a member of the Left; he may well be a member of the Left of the Labor Party&mdash;was that he too is strongly opposed to this course of action by the federal government. He is ideologically a strong compulsory unionist and believes in compelling young Australians, regardless of their choice, to be conscripted to the student union. It is no different from conscripting young Australians during the 1960s and making them go and fight a war that they did not want to fight. There is no difference whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no difference whatsoever. The argument was put forward that when one is conscripted into a student union one can conscientiously object. That makes the point, does it not? Conscription to Vietnam was okay because one could conscientiously object, and that makes it okay on campuses around Australia. The coalition is saying that conscription on campus should be ended. Senator McMullan, who is at the table, used to march in the anti-conscription rallies, I am quite sure, when he had a lot more hair, and a lot longer hair, I presume&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He used to march and fight for an issue which was extremely important to him at the time and important to tens of thousands of young Australians at that time. Of course the same principles apply. This government is saying that, if a state government gives individual students who turn up to campus and want to get on with an education the choice as to whether or not they join a student union, it will penalise all the state taxpayers and then, to pick up the tab, penalise every single taxpayer around Australia. That is a very dangerous course of action to take because it will make student unions totally unresponsive to the needs of their members. It will indeed make them the lackeys of the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That takes me on to the second and different point I want to make in relation to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. Yesterday when I was sitting in an airport lounge I read a statement by former Senator Graham Richardson in a column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine giving our leader, Mr Downer, some advice on how to make the Liberal Party win the next federal election. We appreciate all the advice that former Senator Richardson has been giving us over the last few days and I am sure we will even adopt pieces of it. One of the pieces of advice we should not adopt is his suggestion in that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> that we should abandon what he calls our antiquated states rights rhetoric. It has been many years since I have heard a conservative politician use the words states rights. Usually our enemies in the Labor Party talk about states rights because it suits them to use those words because they are fairly meaningless. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coates" NAMEID="LF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coates can indeed quote me on that whenever he wants to. All of the Liberals that I discuss the issues of federalism with use the words states responsibilities and individual liberty. There is no greater example of how the federation of Australia has been corrupted and changed for the worse than in this area of federal-state financial relations. Anyone who has done a study of government in Australia knows that it is an area where the federation is creaking and groaning and massive pain is being suffered. The solutions are very hard to find. I want to put on the record in this debate my view that if we do not have a vigorous federation and a sensible set of arrangements, particularly in the area of who does the taxing and who does the spending, for lay people, or fiscal federalism, for people who read the textbooks on it, then Australia will end up being a most inefficient, overtaxed and overgoverned nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that we have in our federation are well worthy of protecting and enhancing, and some of those things can only be protected and enhanced if we earnestly seek solutions to the fiscal federalism conundrum. That means ensuring that the states have a guaranteed share of income, that they are not coming cap in hand to Canberra every year, and that there is more responsibility on states when it comes to spending those taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply must ensure that there is a whole range of responsibilities left at the local level, at the state level, with governments that are far more accountable to their populations than a government, particularly in the case of Western Australia, that resides some 3,000 kilometres away from where all of the people live. We need a system&mdash;an act&mdash;of federation in Australia, because we do have a massive continent. We have people spread across one of the biggest land masses on the globe. We need power dispersed and kept in the hands of those individuals who can exercise that power when their governments move out of line, as has happened around Australia in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria in recent times. Governments have run off the rails. Labor governments, in all of those cases, have been swept out of power because people close to that point of power have swept them out of office. All of those states now have reformist liberal governments or coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other benefits of having a diverse federation where power is divided is to ensure that we have competition in public policy. If we have all public policy designed here in Canberra by politicians, bureaucrats and think-tanks, we end up with one public policy. We end up with one education policy, one health policy, one transport policy, one justice system, one human rights policy, and no competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would like to see is vigorous public policy competition going on between the states, particularly in the area of service delivery where we find so many inefficiencies in Australia that cost the taxpayers so much. We have a lot of duplication, and unnecessary duplication at that. We do need to ensure that we have that competition. For example, if Victoria can find a way of delivering public transport better than Western Australia, and proves that it can find efficiencies in that one area, then Western Australia can copy Victoria.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Western Australia has a transport system and makes mistakes in its transport system, then, of course, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland can make sure that they do not repeat those mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this dynamic federalism which could help all of Australia. But we have got to ensure that there is a genuine division of powers; we must ensure that we do not have duplication; and we must ensure that we maximise competition both in service delivery and in the tax bundle that we use to fund that service delivery. Ultimately, we need to create competition between the tax systems and the service delivery functions so that all individual Australian taxpayers benefit from competition in providing the tax service bundle. That is what needs to be achieved and that is why Australia at the moment is going in absolutely the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we analyse some of the other great federations of the world like the United States, Germany and Canada, we see that they have much more balance in their fiscal federalism areas where taxation and spending decisions are kept in much greater harmony. In Australia, the balance has gone right out of kilter in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I cannot defend too much the Fraser Liberal government, because even under the Fraser government fiscal federalism did tend to centralise a little bit. But under the Hawke and Keating governments, fiscal federalism has seen the most massive centralisation of power in the hands of politicians and bureaucrats in Canberra, particularly in terms of taxation, in the history of the Australian federation&mdash;only a short history, as you would know Mr Acting Deputy President. We must ensure that this is reversed. We must ensure that spending and taxing decisions are brought back into harmony for the benefit of all taxpayers, and the benefits that they will receive when they buy services from their state governments or the authorities of those governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have witnessed under the Hawke and Keating governments not only one of the greatest centralisations of taxation power, but also one of the most massive increases in Commonwealth own purpose spending in the history of Australia. During the inquiry into the Centenary House affair, I took the trouble to go to the parliamentary library and ask officers to pull out research on what has happened to Commonwealth own purpose spending going back to the war. If I had the graphs that were produced with me I would incorporate them, but I do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those graphs show a very steady but low level of increase in Commonwealth own purpose spending under Menzies and Holt, then during the 1970s and, even under Whitlam, a relatively flat growth&mdash;there was a little blimp in 1974-75, from memory&mdash;and then the rate of increase continued to rise at roughly the same rate through the Fraser years. We then see a massive upswing in Commonwealth own purpose spending with only a small respite during the time that former Senator Peter Walsh was in Finance&mdash;we see it flatten out. The curve goes upwards at an alarming rate and, particularly in the last two or three years, we have seen Commonwealth own purpose spending go up rapidly. Quite frankly, that is one of the reasons why Australia, regardless of its outstanding economic growth&mdash;by international comparisons&mdash;still suffers massive problems in relation to interest rates and the underlying inflationary pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with massive fiscal centralisation is that if a Commonwealth government runs amuck with federal spending&mdash;and we have seen this government screwing down the states on spending, but spending taxpayers' money with both hands when it comes to its own purposes&mdash;there is very little control. If we have more fiscal control in the hands of the states, then we set up this competition I was talking about earlier, so that the states that can deliver the services to their consumers at a lower tax rate will, of course, be more politically popular. That creates overall competition to see who can keep the tax service bundle the most efficient. If we have more fiscal power consolidated in the hands of one executive here in Canberra, then it is very hard to control the runaway own purpose spending we have seen under the Hawke and Keating governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use the second reading debate on this bill to make those points. I think that former Senator Richardson has it wrong. I think he is right to the extent that it is incumbent upon the Liberal Party not to argue in terms of giving states rights, because we have never believed in that. We are traditionally a party that distrusts executive power and, of course, we stand for smaller government. We must get our rhetoric right in delivering our message of ensuring that individuals have rights and more control over the executives which need to be closer to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I agree with former Senator Richardson. We do not want to be labelled as these dogmatic, right wing states rights troglodytes. That is what the Labor Party would like to paint us as; we are not. We are libertarians in the classic sense of the word. We believe in small government and we believe in the rights of the individual. We believe&mdash;and I will end where I started off&mdash;in voluntarism. In respect of clause 15, we believe in the right of young Australians who turn up on campus to choose whether or not to join a student union. </PARA>

It has no place whatsoever in a bill which purports on the face of it to say that it is giving money to the states by way of grants for general purposes. In other words, it is saying that it is appropriate for states to determine their own fiscal and financial future and determine their own priorities for spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tucked away in the middle of this legislation is clause 15, which is entitled `Higher education funding condition'. What that does is basically guarantee compulsory funding by the taxpayer to student unions irrespective of their service delivery, irrespective of how good they are and irrespective of whether they represent the wishes and aspirations of the students that they allegedly serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear all the time from the government that, just because people believe in voluntary student unionism, they are somehow anti-student union or anti-student organisation. What that implies is that, if we give the students the choice as to whether or not they want to be members of such organisations, they would desert them in droves. That is, of course, a very poor and sad reflection on the leadership of student unions and student associations around the country and is also indicative of the fact that the students&mdash;usually being the more intelligent sector of the community, having attained tertiary education&mdash;have made a decision for themselves that the student unions and the student organisations do not represent their best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compulsory aspect of the unions is most iniquitous. What it does is force students to contribute to absolutely scurrilous causes with which they may vehemently disagree. Indeed, in the Perth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> on 3 July 1994&mdash;only two months ago&mdash;there was a substantial article which was entitled `Christian students lash Uni magazine'. It referred to the Edith Cowan University student newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harambee</EMPHASIS>. That newspaper had been undertaking on that campus a sustained campaign against Christian students and Christian beliefs. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The references included sexual remarks about sacred aspects of their faith and Mary.</PARA>

<PARA>One wonders what the reaction of members of the Labor Party would have been if we were to insert some religion or some organisation other than the Christian faith or the Catholic faith. Undoubtedly, they would get up, beat their self-righteous breasts and accuse the student newspaper of being outrageous. But if it attacks what 80 per cent of the population basically accept as their faith, it is okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these Christian and Catholic students objected to was the fact that, as a pre-condition to their obtaining an education, they had to contribute to the student guild which funded such absolute religious obscenities. I defy the minister, I defy the government and, indeed, I defy the Australian Democrats and the Greens, who support this clause in the bill, to explain why it ought to be made a precondition to the students at Edith Cowan University to get an education that they be required to fund such a contribution as that in their student newspaper.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand this addition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harambee</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is but one of many that have consistently ridiculed Christian beliefs and practices.</PARA>
<PARA>Why should a student be required to compulsorily fund an organisation which seeks to belittle the very heart and essence of that person's existence&mdash;namely, his faith? Why should students have that belittled and then have to contribute to that belittling process by way of a compulsory fund, a fund that has to be contributed to because, if they do not, they are denied an education? This is coming from the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, which go round this country saying how they are somehow the harbingers of human rights and individual rights and concerned about the right of individuals to pursue their own wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student unions grew up in an era many years ago when students basically had to distance themselves from the community at large. It was a bit like entering holy orders. Students got out of the community at large, and their whole life was based around the university. Their study, their social life, their sporting life&mdash;all of it was centred on the university; whereas today, with greater mobility, communications and the like, students now find that they are playing sports with outside groups and organisations funding the sports, but also have to contribute by way of a compulsory fee to, let us say, the university football club, which they may find themselves playing against that very next Saturday or Sunday. It is absolutely ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similarly the case for social activities. There is no longer any need to say that students have to contribute funds to enable the enjoyment of a social life on campus. Why should they be forced to enjoy a social life on campus if they do not want to? Surely, if students want to enjoy their social life as, let us say, these Catholic students at Edith Cowan University want to enjoy their social life or their free time by pursuing different pursuits, they ought to be entitled to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause in this legislation is simply, once again, a reward to the student unions for having funded and bankrolled the Labor Party at the last federal election.

The maritime union got a very good handshake out of this maritime strike. I recommend to honourable senators the very fine article that my deputy leader, Peter Costello, wrote concerning that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the student unions: it is quite clear that during the last federal election campaign they funded the federal Labor Party to an extent that cost the Liberal Party some marginal seats.

Clearly the issue in this debate is that there is no basis for funding a student union if it cannot command the support both by membership and in monetary terms from the students. How does the federal government justify to the people of Australia that it will fund a student union which fails to attract the support of the members and the students whom it is allegedly in place to represent? All that the state governments have done around this country is to offer the students a choice. The minister, Senator McMullan, somehow sees that as an outrageous interference in the way universities conduct themselves. That, in effect, means that Senator McMullan and the government are willing to override the way states conduct themselves but not the way universities conduct themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

I also happen to know that university councillors get appointed by their own fellows. They exist by way of appointment and recommendation and do not have to face the people of their state or indeed of the university at large. So the states are a lot more attuned to the wishes and aspirations of the people of the various states and the various communities that they represent. For example, if the people of Western Australia consider that voluntary student unionism is an outrage, then at the next state election they have the right to alter that government and to get a Labor government in which would reimpose compulsory student unionism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Ian Campbell reminds me, they had that right in the by-election in Western Australia which the Labor Party lost to the incumbent government. So the people of each state around the Commonwealth have the right to determine the social policies that best fit them. The federal government is now saying that, if the state government gives students the choice, the money that is denied to the student union by students voting with their money and saying, `We don't want to be part of that student union,' will be taken off the state grant and, as a result, the state government will get less money. What does that mean? That means less money for those states to spend on essential services such as police, health, education, roads and all the other important infrastructure areas that state governments seek to fund from ever diminishing moneys given to them by the federal government. They will now face an extra impost as a result of the Labor Party's blind commitment to funding its mates who supported it at the last federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a penalty on the state governments; it is also a penalty on the people of Australia because the money that is ultimately going to these student unions is money that has been raised by the Australian taxpayer. Basically Labor is saying, `The more unrepresentative your union, the more unrepresentative your student organisation, the fewer members you attract, the greater the subsidy you will receive.' If anything, I would have thought that the federal government ought to have said, `If you can attract 100 per cent membership or 90 per cent membership on a voluntary basis, because it shows that you are representing the broad aspirations of the students, then we might assist in providing some extra funds to your student union.' But, no, it does not say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incentive is there to be unrepresentative, to be undemocratic, to keep it with a small clique of students and to then bankroll them out of federal government funds&mdash;out of the Australian taxpayer's pocket. The reason for that is that the more unrepresentative the student union the more likely the money that the Labor government spends on those student unions will find its way back into the pockets of the Australian Labor Party and its re-election campaign. That is what clause 15 is all about and that is why we, as an opposition, oppose it so vehemently. We will divide on that issue because we consider it to be a fundamental principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989, which enables grants of financial assistance to be made to state and territory governments, non-government school systems, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education institutions and Aboriginal and Torres Strait education consultative bodies for the purpose of advancing the education of Aboriginals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current act provides funding for the period from January 1993 to June 1996. This bill amends the funding level for the period from January 1995 to June 1996 and provides for the appropriation of a specified amount for the period from January 1996 to June 1997. The bill provides for an increase in the funds appropriated under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act to support tertiary education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. The funds will be made available under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. This program was introduced in 1990 and underpins the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition fully supports this bill and the funding of education for Aboriginal Australians. Education is fundamental to relieving social disadvantage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the areas of housing, health and employment, as well as improving social justice and bringing about reconciliation. In other words, funding of education is a crucial element in a much broader debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the many social indicators in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, one sees that it is clear that the Labor policies of the past decade have not worked. Despite the government's focus on such issues as land rights, treaties and the policy of funding communities rather than individuals, there is still clear evidence of social disadvantage within these communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately $160 million has been allocated for the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program&mdash;AESIP&mdash;between January 1993 and June 1995. This bill will allocate another $85 million for the period from January 1995 to June 1996. Whilst the funding from January 1996 to June 1997 has not yet been appropriated, it can be estimated that about $330 million will have been allocated in the period from 1993 to 1997. In addition to this initiative, the government will also spend a further $350 million a year in special allocations for Aboriginal education in higher education institutions, and $150 million will go directly to students and their families through Abstudy, tutorial assistance and vocational and educational assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now four years since the Aboriginal education program was established. A review of AESIP this year has revealed that despite the enormous amount of money allocated for these strategies, there is reason to be concerned that greater progress has not been made. For example, there are still significant gaps in the preschool participation rates between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and other Australian four-year-olds; fewer than 80 per cent of five-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in small communities are enrolled in a school; whilst 16 per cent of other Australian children have significantly lower levels of achievement in literacy and numeracy, this figure is as high as 45 per cent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children; and an estimated 25 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who start secondary school leave before the end of year 10. There are also a number of other similar examples that have been highlighted by my colleague Mr Miles in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of the coalition is that over the past few years the government has set itself a number of important and far reaching goals with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. Whilst the coalition acknowledges that some progress has been made, it also recognises that the government has failed in the whole area of adopting appropriate benchmarks to measure the extent of progress made in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of suitable benchmarks in each of these specific areas of Aboriginal education is an urgently needed element of these specific government programs. The coalition supports the funding initiatives of this bill, but emphasises the need for ensuring that the money spent is achieving the outcomes that the government and all Australians expect of such programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 and allocates funds designed to assist the education of Aboriginal people. That represents the continuation of the Commonwealth's Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program which was introduced in 1990 and is part of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term goals identified in the 1989 national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy include increasing the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in decision making in relation to education, ensuring equality of access to educational services, ensuring equity of educational participation and enabling equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are positive goals but they are far from being met. Participation in all forms of education by Aboriginal and Islander people is the lowest experienced by any group in Australia, although Aboriginal enrolments have increased in higher education&mdash;between 1982 and 1992 enrolments rose from 0.3 per cent of total enrolments to 1 per cent; from 854 students to 5,105 students. The completion rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students have almost doubled in the four years from 1988 to 1991 inclusive. However, this is not reflected amongst the total number of higher education completions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students continue to face problems that include a high level of attrition on average, a longer course completion time for their degrees, and a lack of services for Aboriginal students on campuses. We must not simply define involvement in educational participation by Aboriginal groups by looking at numerical increases; we must also look at the type and quality of education offered to Aboriginal students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing that some of the measures of which the Democrats have been particularly critical in changes to Austudy regulations have, by their very nature, impinged very greatly on Aboriginal students. The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), who is at the table, would readily acknowledge that, if in the Aboriginal community there is on average a longer course completion time, the penalising of those students by increasing HECS repayments would logically have a greater impact on Aboriginal students than on others. That was a major reason for the Democrats' objection and opposition to such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last session of this parliament my office met with representatives of Shalom College. It is perhaps the most positive reflection of our multicultural society that Shalom is a Christian college, has a Jewish name and is for Aboriginal and Islander students. But Shalom is about a community; it is about providing lifelong education&mdash;a philosophy to which my party is particularly committed&mdash;as well as striving for academic excellence. It is also about furthering multicultural awareness and contributing towards community development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since it commenced operation in 1992 with 50 students, Shalom College has grown to just under 200 students and it anticipates that its enrolments will reach 600 by 1997. However, Shalom has experienced its own difficulties in getting up and running. Its students have problems with their travel and accommodation costs and there is a need for further financial assistance to overcome those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Shalom is offering all its students&mdash;not just the Aboriginal students, who form the majority&mdash;is a unique opportunity and a wonderful working environment. It is like no other educational institution in Australia. It celebrates a range of different beliefs and cultures. I call on the government to review its commitment to new schools such as this and to work out how it can best assist them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate about education for Aboriginal and Islander people ties in to the wider debate about reconciliation and respect. It is apparent to any observer of this whole process that education plays a fundamental role in self-determination; that means education for Aboriginal people about their rights in a democratic society, and educating the wider community about Aboriginal culture and heritage. In fact, one of the recommendations in the report into Aboriginal deaths in custody is `to provide all Australian students with an understanding of and respect for Aboriginal history, culture and identity'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is self-evident that such a recommendation is, firstly, directed towards resolving the problem of Aboriginal deaths in custody and, secondly, has the extended effect of increasing the opportunities for self-determination. The Democrats support this principle and we urge both the government and the opposition to support such a recommendation and support the communities that have tried to implement such proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the talk over the past few weeks about the coalition's commitment to health, housing and education for Aboriginal and Islander people, we remember the particularly regressive education proposals in the coalition's Fightback package. The opposition proposed cutting access to and levels of Abstudy. Unlike the opposition and the government, we recognise that student financial assistance is a key part of getting disadvantaged groups to enter and participate in higher education. It is more than just a matter of money. We also support provisions in this bill which allow for an increase&mdash;a small one&mdash;to the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program and to support tertiary education provision in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was fortunate to participate in an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into the provision of open learning in Australia. We made a visit to the Yuendumu community near the Tanami Desert. We saw the advantages of a proper commitment to a technological solution to the problems of isolation and communications. The community was taking advantage of satellite communication to communicate with other communities, both in Australia and internationally. Part of the process of self-determination was being fostered by the capacity of that community to communicate with, for example, communities in Alaska. The Alaskan communities have the capacity to relate experiences with their governments and other communities and thereby save the people of the Tanami network the problem of having to confront these problems themselves in an initial sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was able to experience a demonstration of what technology could do to overcome the problems of a longstanding difficulty in communication. I suggest that we should see these things not in isolation but as part of a process of reconciliation and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support the thrust of the government's Aboriginal education policy, which includes responding to the relevant recommendations of the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody, the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy, and the national reconciliation and schooling strategy which promotes the reconciliation process between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people. While some progress has been made in improving education for indigenous people, they still have the lowest level of representation in the education sector&mdash;in a comparative sense, not in an absolute sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude my consideration of this bill, I would like to pay tribute to a young man who worked hard to further the rights of Aboriginal people in the education sector. I speak of Lindsay Croft. Lindsay was an active member of our party, a former junior Canberran of the year and a committed campaigner for improved education for Aboriginal people. Tragically, Lindsay was killed in a car accident in Texas last month while studying in America. He was the first Aboriginal student to receive the coveted Harkness Fellowship. Lindsay was an inspiration to all of us and will be greatly missed by his academic and political colleagues and by his many friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the hard work of people such as Lindsay, indigenous Australians are less likely to finish school than other Australians. They have fewer school and post-school qualifications and continue to face problems such as racial discrimination and a lack of facilities and services, as well as very basic problems with travel and accommodation assistance at schools such as Shalom College. That college is paving the way to providing a unique educational experience for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One possible development in the area of education initiatives for Aboriginal students is today's announcement by the Law Council of Australia and the government of the creation of the John Koowarta Reconciliation Law Scholarship. This scholarship honours the memory of John Koowarta, who was involved in one of Australia's most notable Aboriginal legal battles. It will fund several indigenous people to begin law studies each year and will support recipients through to the completion of their degrees. It is hoped that this scholarship will assist in redressing the under-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the legal system. Of course, it will not be able to do that on its own. It is symbolic and significant but it is certainly not the total answer and I am not suggesting that it could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to reading the report from the national reference group on the review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders which is due for release this month.

Information on the effectiveness of the government's programs and progress towards goals is expected to be available when the final report of the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is released in the near future. The cooperation of state and territory governments is vital if there is to be an effective national strategy on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the states and the territories will need to provide much of the ongoing data that is required to measure progress in this area. In this regard, I draw the attention of the Senate to the speech made by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, on 23 August where he placed particular emphasis on the role of state governments in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills we are debating today are the Grains Legumes Levy Amendment Bill 1994, the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill 1994. As their names suggest, these bills are concerned with the imposition of levies within the relevant crop categories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill and the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill both seek to ensure that where producers use oilseeds or coarse grains on-farm for commercial purposes, they will be liable to pay a research levy. Under the current arrangements, any produce used on-farm for domestic purposes is exempted from the need to pay the levy. The industry is concerned that the current definition of `used for domestic purposes' is exempting produce that farmers are using on-farm for commercial purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speeches on these two bills gave the example of a situation where a producer might establish an intensive animal production unit on-farm of pigs, cattle or chickens while sourcing his or her stockfeed requirements from that same fund. These two bills will clearly establish that where produce is used on-farm for strictly domestic purposes it will continue to be exempted from levy payments but that where it is used on-farm for commercial purposes it will now be liable for levy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure it is generally agreed around this chamber, it is essential that all those producers who benefit from the research and development made possible by the collection of these levies should be contributing their share. These bills extend the liability for levy payments in order to ensure that that goal is met. Of course, the Democrats believe that as a community we also reap significant benefits from agricultural research and, as such, we strongly support the federal government matching growers' contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bill before us today is the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill. This bill makes a change to the way in which the research levy imposed on barley and triticale is payable. Until now the levy on these two crops has been based on a rate per tonne. This bill will replace that rate with an ad valorem rate&mdash;that is, a surcharge based on a percentage of the valued product. This ad valorem rate will ensure that the amount growers are required to pay will be proportional to the amount they actually receive for their crop. In this way, as with the other two bills, the payment arrangement established by this bill will be a more equitable one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was pointed out in the second reading speeches and by other speakers in this debate, these amendments have all been presented at the request of the Grains Council of Australia. The Queensland Graingrowers Association told me that it supports the bills. In light of the imminent start-up date for some of these new arrangements, it has asked that the bills receive speedy passage through the parliament. Given the across-party support for the bills, that passage is now guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude my remarks on these bills, however, I would like to make a few comments on the value of these levies and the research they make possible. The Democrats have always advocated sustainable agriculture, the preservation of soil, water and biodiversity and the use of farming practices which are less chemically and energy intensive. In aiming to achieve these goals, adequate funding for research is absolutely essential. What is more, the developments and initiatives resulting from that research not only help us to attain those goals, but at the same time play a vital role in maintaining Australia's competitive edge in agriculture.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having just spent a week in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and having seen the state of their agriculture, it is certainly true to make that claim here&mdash;although, of course, as they come out of the domination which they have suffered under the Russians for so many years, I am sure they will become as competitive as other European nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that there needs to be strong follow-up support for the developments which arise from these research projects. We have said before that it should not be a case of developing a particular variety or a particular harvesting technique, a particular farming practice or manufacturing process, and then leaving it at that. It is crucial that the government provide the necessary support to ensure that those developments can actually be put into practice. Of course, one of the most important factors in determining what measures individual farmers will and will not implement is their financial position. This is particularly so in times like these when so many farmers are struggling just to stay afloat. The government needs to ensure that its policies allow farmers to remain financially secure and provide them with at least the same benefits enjoyed by all other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that the Democrats have pursued for many years is the inequitable access which farmers have to Austudy and many social security payments. As all senators must surely be aware by now, that inequitable access results from the inclusion of the value of the family farm in the various assets tests applying to these payments. Since 1991 we have been moving amendments to have farm tools of trade exempted from assets tests. To date, we have received little support from either the government or the opposition. I believe that is now changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that this will be an issue that I will be pursuing in the debate on the student assistance bill later in the week. In light of some of the comments made publicly by members of both the government and the opposition in relation to assets testing, I hope that these proposals will be given full consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are currently debating the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill 1994. I understand, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you have recently agreed that we can debate cognately the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill 1994. I will therefore address each of those three bills in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn first to the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill. The coalition supports this legislative change. The bill will ensure that grain legumes and oilseeds used by producers on-farm for commercial purposes are subject to research levy payment. The Grains Council, which is the representative organisation under the legislation for these grains, wants to ensure that the current exemption for grain legumes used on-farm for domestic purposes does not include producers who use them for intensive animal units involving, for example, pigs, cattle or chickens. The move will bring these grains into line with other grains under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 and the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that, because of the drought, levies from legumes are expected to be down this year. Official estimates indicate that levies from legumes will fall from just over $4 million last year to $3.3 million this year. Given the extent of the drought in this country&mdash;for example, 83 per cent of New South Wales is drought declared&mdash;the falloff in levies could be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Levies are paid on the following legumes: field peas, lupins, faba beans, chick peas, mung beans, pigeon peas, peanuts, native beans, vetch, cow peas, and lentils. These crops are not only used domestically but also earn valuable export dollars for Australia. For example, the value of the lupin crop in 1993-94 was estimated at about $255 million and exports were about $100 million. The value of the field pea crop is about $128 million and exports of peas, including field peas, chick peas and cow peas, are worth more than $150 million a year. Given the obvious importance of these crops to Australia, the coalition is pleased to support the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the second bill under consideration, the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill 1994. Again, the coalition supports this legislation. The bill will ensure that oilseeds used by a producer on-farm for commercial purposes are subject to research levy payment. The Grains Council of Australia, which is again the representative organisation under the legislation for these grains, wants to ensure that the current exemption for oilseeds used on-farm for domestic purposes does not include a producer who, firstly, uses them for an intensive animal unit on-farm&mdash;for example, pigs, cattle or chickens&mdash;or, secondly, sets up a manufacturing industry such as a margarine plant to gain an unfair advantage.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This move will bring oilseeds into line with other grains under the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 and the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, oilseed production in Australia is expanding as people look for alternative crops and as existing markets grow. For example, in 1991-92 only 84,000 tonnes of sunflower seed were produced. Last year that figure rose to 176,000 tonnes. It will be interesting to see</PARA>
<PARA>what happens in the future, particularly once the drought breaks. Levies are paid on the following oilseeds: sunflower, soybean, linseed, safflower and rapeseed. In this financial year, research and development levies are expected to amount to just over $2 million. Once again, I indicate that the coalition supports this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third piece of legislation that is being considered, the Coarse Grains Levy Amendment Bill 1994, also attracts the support of the coalition. Essentially, it changes the basis for assessing research levies on barley and triticale from a flat rate per tonne to an ad valorem rate which brings these products into line with oats, cereal rye, sorghum, maize, millet and canary seed. It is appropriate that this be done. The Grains Council of Australia and the Triticale Grain Association of New South Wales have recommended the change as a way of ensuring that growers' contributions to research are proportional to their net returns instead of being a flat rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both organisations have recommended an initial operative levy rate of one per cent of net farm gate value. In the legislation there is a maximum rate of five per cent. It should be noted that this is five per cent of the net farm gate value. It should not be confused with the 0.5 per cent of the gross value of the product, which is the maximum amount for dollar-for-dollar funding for government research and development funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Barley is a major crop in Australia. Production in 1993-94 was valued at $925 million and exports at $464 million. Triticale, a cross between wheat and rye used mainly for animal feed, only commenced production in the 1970s; but in 1992-93, the crop was worth $36 million. Last year levies from coarse grain raised just over $7 million and this money is being used to help Australian farmers stay ahead through excellent research work. The current levy on barley is $1.133 a tonne and on triticale it is $1. The new rate will be one per cent of the value of the grain and this amount can be altered by regulation up to a maximum rate of five per cent of sales value. I conclude by reiterating coalition support for this bill and in fact the package of three bills under consideration. </PARA>

It is all very well for the government to argue, as it did in debate on the horticultural bill, that the levy will be gathered on that basis. As I said in debate on the horticultural bill, how will the government police it? I would certainly like to know how the government will police it with these sorts of grains which are classed as everything commercial used on the farm. I do not see much use for barley on a farm that is not commercial, unless it is used to make the odd plate of soup for the table. Perhaps the minister could give me an answer on that if he has time this afternoon, otherwise I support the bill and look to the day that all farm produce levies are raised on the ad valorem rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the situation of Australian South Sea Islanders was presented to the then Attorney-General, Mr Michael Duffy, on 20 January 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said at the outset that the length of time taken by the government to respond to the report is inexcusable. I realise that the Attorney-General's Department has had to liaise with a number of other government departments in formulating its response, but that should not be an excuse for leaving the issue hanging for so long. The report makes clear that Australia's South Sea Islander community is in a situation of high need, with particular difficulties in school retention, employment skills, home ownership and health. The report was clear and succinct and provided only six recommendations. It should not have been too hard for the government to respond to these much more quickly than it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations was for a specific allocation to be made in the 1993-94 budget for various programs for South Sea Islanders and organisations. Not only was this not addressed in the 1993-94 budget but it was also absent in this year's budget, well over a year after the report was originally presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes clear that Australia's South Sea Islanders have suffered from a century of racial discrimination and are significantly disadvantaged as a result. It is for this reason that it is so crucial that they are officially recognised as a distinct minority group and therefore provide the assistance which the Racial Discrimination Act offers to such groups. For example, on page 69 of the report there is a call for recognition. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The call for recognition is the most fundamental and most often expressed demand of South Sea Islanders. They report of many ways in which they are described as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, and want to be recognised as a distinct racial group. One simple example pointed out by John Clubb of Innisfail is that three Australian servicemen who died in Vietnam and were described in press reports as Torres Strait Islanders were in fact South Sea Islanders&mdash;Francis Fewquandie, Norman Womal, and Noel Harold. This confusion with other races continually belittles the South Sea Islanders, who feel that they played their part in developing Australia and are now ignored or forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA>I visited Mackay in April this year and had a meeting with one of the prominent groups of South Sea Islanders in that city. That is where the largest group of South Sea Islanders exists in this nation today. The obvious pride that they have in their own culture and history is embodied in the meeting place where we gathered on a Sunday afternoon where they pressed me very hard on a number of the issues which are raised within the report. They certainly were well aware of the report. They were very keen that the report should be pursued and the recommendations put before the parliament and enacted, and that practical support for those recommendations should be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to examine the statement that the government has made against the recommendations, especially in terms of funding which is being provided. It is good to recognise the South Sea Islanders as a separate race. It would be a very ironic situation if, in recognising them as a separate race, that was to their financial detriment. It would in fact be a tragedy if they were less able to access the support services currently available to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. It seems to me that the $80,000 which has been mentioned as the initial grant by the government is really only equal to the salary of perhaps two community workers and the many other needs that are mentioned in this report really are not at all covered by that amount of money. So my concern is a very real one that the government will recognise the report and the recommendations which are made and make appropriate funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention also that recently for the second time in Mackay the community building which was built by and on behalf of the South Sea Islanders was burnt down. The suggestion is that it was done by arsonists and possibly as an expression of the racism of some very misguided people in that city. I do not know what the result of investigations has shown in that regard but I hope that as these people establish their own place within our nation they will be able and allowed to make the kind of contribution that I know they are capable of making. For these reasons I commend the report and the government's response to the Senate. </PARA>

<TITLE>Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="925" SPEAKER="Chamarette Sen C.M.A." NAMEID="SN5" PARTY="GWA" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (6.16 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past two weeks in Western Australia there have been four deaths in custody. I want to record here my condolences to the families of those who have needlessly died and my sorrow at our apparent inability to stop this appalling loss of young lives. We were recently able to mark the fourth anniversary of the last West Australian death in police custody, but that record was ended last Tuesday with the death of an Aboriginal man who collapsed while he was being held in court cells. Because of the valuable work of the Aboriginal visitors scheme it was made known to the police that this person had a heart problem and required his medication. Despite this useful information, he was not able to have proper medical care and the resultant tragedy is yet another witness to the failure of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody to actually provide adequate medical access for those who come within the scope of the criminal justice system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three other deaths have all been at the Canning Vale Remand Centre and, tragically, the three young men all knew each other. They were all on remand. We can only guess at the devastation being felt by the circle of friends which encompassed those three men. Beyond the tragedy there is the certain knowledge that these deaths should not have happened and that the Australian community has a duty and responsibility to see that deaths in custody are made a sad chapter in our country's past. What we have at the moment is a situation of despair for those whose families have been shattered or destroyed and shame on our society for allowing these deaths to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with concern that there is little sense of outrage in the wider community, but there most certainly should be. It is difficult perhaps to understand why there should be such equanimity about this scourge which has plagued our country for so many years. Perhaps there is a sense of `It couldn't happen to my child or to me.' Have we allowed ourselves to be convinced that anyone in custody, whether on remand or as punishment, is guilty of a heinous crime and somehow is not deserving of compassion? Has our community decided that people in custody have no human rights? Are we sucked in by the myth that a short, sharp time in prison, even if those people are on remand, is an adequate way of teaching them a lesson? I maintain it is time society learnt the lesson that damaging human lives and placing, in this case, young people in prison while they are still on remand and not proven guilty of any offence is tantamount to aiding and abetting in their deaths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only speculate about what has shaped community perceptions of this issue. But regardless of the community's attitude, we have to put a stop to it. This country spent some $35 million investigating the deaths of 99 Aboriginal people in custody. The royal commission provided governments and the community with 339 recommendations aimed at putting an end to the tragedy. Each year, each government produces a report showing its proud record in implementing those recommendations. But the deaths continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, the government tells us that more than 90 per cent of the recommendations have been implemented. But still the deaths go on. The Western Australian Deaths In Custody Watch Committee, which was formed early this year, has been very successful in seeing ministers and officials from government departments. It has been heartening to see how ready those in authority have been to discuss matters with the committee, and I most certainly want to record that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to even the most casual observer that, for all the goodwill and whatever the level of willingness to address the recommendations, there is an enormous gap between the changed practices and procedures as they are enshrined in the policy manuals and the delivery on the ground. I am not for one moment suggesting that prison officers or police officers are not affected by these deaths. I am sure that they also have a sense of failure, and experience pain and grief over the deaths. But, clearly, there is a failure to effectively implement the changed procedures and practices, and that is a matter for governments and government departments to address, and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three deaths in Canning Vale Remand Centre need to be seen in the context of the extremely high rates of remand which are a pattern of the Western Australian police and court system. Far too many young people are held in custody when they should be bailed or charged by summons. As was pointed out by the chairman of the watch committee last week, some 50 to 60 per cent of those who are held in remand before their court cases are heard are not given a custodial sentence when convicted. The question has to be asked: if no custodial sentence is likely upon conviction, why are these people not bailed immediately after arrest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is wasting the lives of far too many young people in the 15- to 25-year age group. We are wasting their lives through unemployment and through failing to use their potential for the community's good, and too often we are losing them through suicide or suicide-like deaths in cars, by drugs and alcohol, or simply by allowing them to fall onto society's scrap heap. It is becoming almost predictable that those who die in custody are aged between 18 and 25. The three young men who have died in these past few days in Canning Vale were aged 19 and 21. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to also focus on one particular death which was not so recent. Stephen Wardle died in the East Perth lockup some seven years ago, and the circumstances surrounding his death have still not been satisfactorily explained. The fact that 17 police officers refused to give evidence at the inquest has left far too many questions and does them no credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that expert evidence acquired by the family from a toxicologist in the United States has not been satisfactorily tested is still a matter of concern. The fact that members of Stephen's family have been subjected to the most extraordinary episodes of police attention also raises concerns. Stephen's death and the subsequent inquiry into it raise concerns not only about the particular case but also about the general situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be easy for some to say that the reaction of Stephen's family is one of vindictiveness or even paranoia, but it is clearly the response of a family which is not convinced that their son's death has been fully and justly dealt with. It is also the response of a family which has been devastated and which will not be able to resolve their grief without getting answers to their questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the general level, Stephen's death raises questions about those deaths in which a lack of care or a lack of due diligence on the part of authorities is a factor, and those incidents in which those same authorities are prepared to stand by and either fail in their duty to investigate properly or, worse, stand in the way of proper inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deaths which occur in our gaols, remand centres and police lockups will never end completely, because no system will ever be perfect. But avoidable deaths will continue until there is a genuine will on the part of governments, corrective service departments and staff at all levels to end them. Governments are clearly not willing to acknowledge their failures in implementing the recommendations of the royal commission. It seems they are also unwilling to commit the time, energy and resources to making sure that changes decided on at the policy level are implemented in fact rather than on paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, it seems that the Australian community is prepared to accept that people, especially young people, are going to die as a result of coming into contact with the justice system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening in the adjournment debate to comment on the behaviour of the media in recent times and to highlight Monica Attard's excellent address when she won the Walkley Award and, in doing so, combine that with comment on the outrageous attack by certain elements of the media on my friend and colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Nick Minchin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To commence my remarks, it is appropriate to recall what Monica Attard said. It is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 9 September on page 3. Might I add, simply as an aside, that I think it was the only newspaper to report her comments&mdash;in itself an indication of the sort of censorship that the people of Australia unfortunately have to put up with from the media. The article stated that Australian political journalism had been invaded by a Canberra based pack. Ms Attard said that this journalistic culture resulted in poor and unfair coverage of the Liberal Party. She went on to say that, if stories did not fit a certain preconceived pattern, they often did not get a run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She then suggested this proposition for consideration: `We might begin asking whether the tried and true methods are making of us judges and executioners of individual politicians rather than being reporters chronicling events around us, asking questions and reporting the answers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the media in recent times has sought to do, first of all to my leader, Alexander Downer, and now more recently to his parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Minchin, is to somehow attack and assert that, if one addresses a certain organisation, one automatically embraces its views and somehow marginalises oneself in the Australian political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley pursued that line with a notice of motion which he gave on the last day of sitting, but I do note that Senator Coulter on the same day gave a very good and proper notice of motion relating to free speech. Ultimately, the test is not whom one addresses but what one says when addressing that particular group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, for myself, I would have thought that entertaining an audience with the Palestine Liberation Organisation would be an affront to democracy and would be an affront to all civil standards that one might hold dear. Yet the simple fact is the state of Israel took up discussions with the PLO and has now been able to resolve some fairly important longstanding differences. The only way those issues were resolved was because they took up a dialogue: they were willing to talk to each other. So there we have a fairly recent example of where speaking to groups to whom one may be very much opposed can produce good results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Nick Minchin to have been attacked because he addressed some organisation in recent times is, to my way of thinking, an example of the Australian media becoming partisan players and doing the dirty work for the Australian Labor Party. Surely the media's job is to report the facts and not to seek to tarnish somebody because that person has addressed a particular organisation, in this case the Australian Freedom Foundation. Senator Nick Minchin addressed that group in Adelaide. Those people are entitled to know his views just as much as any other South Australian citizens are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Channel 7, with respect, was quite out of order when it sought to suggest that Senator Minchin showed appalling judgment for speaking at a seminar which that channel asserted had links with the League of Rights. Whether that organisation does or does not have links with it I do not know. It appears that it does not, but whether it does or does not is beside the point. Surely, within our country we have not reached the stage where people are not allowed to address organisations from which they may have very strong and differing views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On two occasions I have addressed Trotskyite organisations in Tasmania, yet the media does not in any way seek to assert that, as a result, I am a Trotskyite. I may have addressed the boy scout movement; but that does not make me a boy scout. Similarly, if Senator Nick Minchin addresses the Australian Freedom Foundation members on a topic that they wanted to hear him speak on, it does not necessarily mean that he embraces their values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time the media got out of the rat pack mentality and started to look at the principles of free speech and the importance of dialogue with different groups within the community, and not marginalise people and organisations just because they disagree. If there is disagreement or differences surely it is within the interests of all Australians that an active dialogue be undertaken with those groups to ascertain possibly some areas of agreement and some areas where the disagreements can be resolved. The example I used earlier in this speech was the state of Israel commencing dialogue and discussions with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the people of Australia are becoming sick and tired of the media seeking to be judge and jury, of reporters pretending to be reporters but acting as commentators. If they want to be commentators, let them state that that is what they are doing. It is not for a news bulletin such as that of Channel 7 the other night to criticise Senator Minchin for showing appalling judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If somebody from the Labor Party wants to make that assertion and do that sort of grubby, dirty political work, let the Labor Party do it; but for a Channel 7 reporter to seek to make that assertion I find beyond the pale and beyond the duty the reporter has. It very badly lets down the people of Australia because they happen to think that the news as provided by that reporter&mdash;or, more correctly, commentator&mdash;was the factual situation when it was a commentary by a biased journalist who was doing the dirty work for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very shortly in this country we will be in the situation where the Labor Party will not have to issue media releases attacking the Liberal Party, because the reporters&mdash;more accurately described as commentators&mdash;will be doing all the dirty work. I ask all journalists to read the article by Errol Simper on page 3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 September 1994, a report of Ms Monica Attard's comments on receiving her well-deserved award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would hope that somebody who has won such a prestigious prize in journalism would be able to see through the rat pack mentality of the media in this country, and that people like that would be able to assess themselves in a mature and moderate way and realise that what they have become is the henchmen of the Labor Party, the thought police and those pursuing what they believe to be the politically correct agenda. Let the people decide what the correct political agenda is; but they can do so only if they are given fair and accurate reports in the media. I call on all journalists to do that and take to heart the words of Monica Attard when she received her award. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Austrade does adopt a consistent approach to the processing of claims in that a grant is paid only in respect of expenditure which has been assessed as being eligible under the terms and conditions of the Export Market Development Grants Act, 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Austrade believes that the timely processing of claims is of paramount importance to companies eligible for Export Market Development Grants. Austrade sets an annual target of processing in excess of 95% of all claims in the same financial year in which they are lodged. Austrade believes that this approach returns substantial benefit to the exporting community in that funds are quickly made available to companies to enable them to continue their export market development efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Explanatory notes detailing substantiation requirements for each financial year are prepared by Austrade. These were sent to all 1992/93 claimants. When applying for a grant, it is made clear to all claimants, both on the claim application form and in contact with Austrade staff, that at the time the claim is assessed, original documentation will be required to be presented in order to substantiate claimed expenditure. Austrade also communicates its requirements regularly to consultants who prepare around half of all EMDG claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claimants whose claims are assessed in June have more time than claimants whose claims are assessed earlier in the financial year to assemble the required documentation before the claim is assessed. In some cases, in order to ensure timely processing of claims, some companies may have been given less time to provide additional documentation than if their claim had been processed earlier. Where a company believes they have been disadvantaged in this way, they have the right of appeal against the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Austrade is concerned to maintain the integrity of the EMDG Scheme by continually reviewing substantiation requirements in accordance with the latest expert advice. As a result of recommendations flowing from the recent Efficiency Audit of the EMDG Scheme conducted by the Australian National Audit Office and discussions with the Australian Federal Police, Austrade will be seeking greater amounts of substantiating documentation for claims submitted in the current, and future, financial years. This is being done to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Scheme and to further reduce the possibility of payments being made for incorrectly claimed expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Austrade's senior staff are eligible for performance pay based on negotiated performance agreements. In offices where the primary function is the processing of EMDG claims, the number processed is one of the measures in any such agreements. While this is an important performance indicator, it is not the only factor that is taken into account in assessing an officer's achievements against their performance agreement. Performance pay is not paid on the basis of the number of claims processed alone. The same principle applied in the 1992-93 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Information on performance pay paid in 1993/94 is not yet available. In the 1992/93 financial year Austrade paid a total of $22,958 in performance pay to officers concerned with the processing of EMDG claims. This figure represents 1.2% of a total administrative expenditure of $1.836 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 21 January 1994, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Australia and the Government of Eritrea relating to the Eritrea Mineral Exploration Project. The project is intended to establish and provide training to the Geological Survey of Eritrea over its first two field seasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The aim of the project is to strengthen Eritrea's capacity to systematically research, assess and demonstrate its mineral potential by developing a viable geological survey unit in the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Water Resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Government's contribution to the project will total approximately $461,170 over two years. Of this, $46,500 will be made available for provision of allowances, travel and accommodation costs associated with the involvement of Australian personnel. Also included is $399,670 for the purchase of equipment and material supplied for the execution of the project. An amount of $15,000 has been made available for in-Australia training attachments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government role in the project is to provide aid for the development of a geological survey capacity in Eritrea. This is to be achieved by demonstrating field and mapping techniques to Eritrean geologists over two field seasons. It includes provision of basic equipment required to undertake systematic field exploration of the Asmara mineral belt and assistance with the chemical analysis of the samples collected. Most of the equipment and all of the chemical analysis will be provided by Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australian mining companies, including BHP, Western Mining and CRA, have expressed interest in mineral exploration in Eritrea which has known deposits of industrial metals and possible deposits of copper, gold and off-shore oil and gas. Through geological and geochemical mapping carried out under the project, and by developing further the capacity of the Eritrean Ministry of Energy, Mines and Water Resources to continue this work, business linkages in the mining sector will be facilitated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A list of significant major capability projects undertaken by the Australian Government and those planned in the future are at Annexes A and B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Defence is required to abide by the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines which include open and effective competition. This principle is usually implemented by an open tendering process whereby both Australian and overseas companies are able to tender for any particular project. It is not feasible for all Defence requirements to be economically developed and supplied locally, therefore tenders usually include a mix of Australian and overseas industry. Where strategically necessary or economically feasible, Australian Industry Involvement has been maximised; for example in the construction of the Collins Class submarines, Anzac ships, minehunters and other projects. However, the tendering process does not provide for seeking separate tenders comprising only local suppliers or for equipment being exclusively purchased from overseas. To do so would significantly increase the costs of tendering to both industry and the Commonwealth. Also direct comparison of local and overseas equipment is not always possible because of changes/adaptations of equipment to meet specific Australian strategic and environmental considerations. Thus it is not possible to provide the information requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The latest project approvals reflect the changes, or anticipated changes, in price for each of the projects detailed at Annex A. Unless the Department was to retender for the particular project there is no precise way to determine the current market value for an ongoing project. As the original approval is based on the results from open tendering the original project cost estimate is in all probability based on market prices. Subsequent price movements would be similarly based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The policy of self-reliance has been a central feature of defence policy since the early 1970s. The policy was identified as a primary requirement in the 1976 White Paper. The concept has been refined in subsequent reviews of defence capabilities and reiterated in the 1987 White Paper&mdash;Defence of Australia (DOA 87) and the Strategic Review 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering self-reliance&mdash;which does not mean self-sufficiency&mdash;the Defence organisation is considering its capacity to provide for the self-reliant defence of Australia and its interests. As identified in DOA 87, it would benefit our self-reliance and local industry if all our defence requirements could be developed and supplied locally. Such a course is not feasible for a country of Australia's size. Local industry can be less </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">susceptible to interruption of supply by interdiction or decisions by foreign governments and is more likely to treat Australia's military needs as a high priority. The capacity to maintain, repair, modify and adapt defence equipment to the Australian environment, independently of overseas sources, is of fundamental importance for our combat effectiveness in all levels of conflict. Recognising that Australian industry cannot be expected to be competitive across the full range of defence requirements, defence policy for industry is an integral part of defence planning and sets priorities for the use of resources for the development of local industrial capability. Those priorities include the repair, overhaul and adaptation of military equipment fundamental to Australia's defence and a range of technology and supply and support capabilities that meet the longer-term needs of the ADF in an acceptable balance of benefits and costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A buyer's market may exist in the global arms trade but that market is for specific items, for many of which Australia would have neither a requirement nor an interest. It is against this background that defence projects are developed and procurement alternatives evaluated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In May 1987, the Government approved the acquisition of six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy at an estimated project cost of $3892 million (in June 1986 prices). Of this amount $3369 million was the contract price for the Australian Submarine Corporation. The remaining $523 million was for associated facilities, supply support, government furnished equipment, project management support, etc associated with the introduction to service of the new submarines. The Collins Class submarines are of an original design to meet the requirements of the RAN and the additional facilities are necessary to ensure self reliance for through-life support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated project cost has risen to $5009m in December 1994 prices of which the contract price represents $4295 million and the provision for facilities, supply support, government furnished equipment, project management support, etc represents $714m. The increase is due to increases in the price of materials and labour rates in accordance with official indices partially offset by favourable variations in the exchange rate since 1987.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As a member of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Australia has access to the reports of the IAEA Director General to the Board on the IAEA's safeguards implementation activities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Subject to the IAEA's obligation to protect safeguards-in-confidence information, these reports have included some information on the safeguards activities the Agency has requested permission to conduct on the fuel elements discharged from the core of the 5MW(e) nuclear reactor at the DPRK's Yongbyon nuclear complex in late May/early June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am unable to confirm the precise content of the statement attributed to IAEA spokesperson Mr Berhanykun Andemicael concerning the specific safeguards activities conducted by inspectors during the fuel discharge process. However I can confirm that no obstacles were raised to the safeguards measures required to verify the non-diversion of the fuel discharged from the 5MW(e) reactor. This fuel is in storage under the Agency's surveillance and inspectors are currently present at the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3), (4) As noted in answer to (2) above, the fuel from the 5MW(e) reactor is under IAEA surveillance and inspectors are currently present at the site. The detail of surveillance mechanisms employed by the IAEA at any given safeguarded location is protected as safeguards-in-confidence information. The fuel has been fully discharged from the reactor and is being stored in a cooling pond. As the fuel's magnox cladding is susceptible to corrosion, the fuel cannot be stored for an extended period in the cooling pond. Depending on the quality of the water in the pond, the fuel will begin to deteriorate soon if it is not treated or moved to a more suitable storage facility. This is an important issue which is being discussed as part of the dialogue between the United States and the DPRK on the nuclear issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a) The Agency sought the agreement of the DPRK to conduct certain specific safeguards measures during the core discharge operation to assess the history of the core, as part of the process of assessing the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's declaration of its nuclear material subject to safeguards. These measures involved selecting a representative sample of fuel rods, segregating them in baskets and securing them for later analysis. This analysis, known as non-destructive assay, in essence aims at comparing, inter alia, the actual burn-up of Uranium 235 and the presence of certain actinides and fission products in discharged fuel rods of known location in the reactor with what should be expected for a declared period and mode of operation. These measures were rejected by the DPRK and the original location of the fuel rods in the core can no longer be reconstructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Selection and segregation, or `fingerprinting', of spent fuel rods for non-destructive assay is a common safeguards technique and has been used by the IAEA on spent fuel from HIFAR at Lucas Heights. The spent fuel inventory at Lucas Heights is kept under containment and surveillance, and a sample is re-verified by IAEA non-destructive assay at each inspection. This process is assisted in the case of Lucas Heights as each HIFAR fuel element carries a unique identification number put on by the manufacturer which could be described as a form of `fingerprinting'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) As noted in answer to (5)(b) above, selection and segregation of spent fuel rods for non-destructive assay is a common safeguards technique.

The safeguards procedures in place at all facilities in Japan comply with the safeguards standards applied by the IAEA to all non-nuclear weapon states with safeguards agreements signed pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Rokkasho-Mura facility in Japan is covered by Japan's safeguards agreement with the IAEA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) As noted under (6) above, information on particular safeguards techniques which might be used at specific facilities is protected by the IAEA as safeguards-in-confidence and can be released only by the government of the country concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) I am unable to validate any claims about the quantity of plutonium that the DPRK may have extracted from the Yongbyon reactor core in 1989. Verification of the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's declared inventory of nuclear materials, including plutonium extracted from Yongbyon spent fuel, is the objective of the process of routine and ad hoc inspections conducted by the IAEA. The IAEA has not yet been given the degree of access it needs to complete its verification activities. Verification of the DPRK's inventory by the IAEA is necessary before any measurable assessment can be made of the DPRK's past plutonium reprocessing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy kilograms of plutonium has not been `lost' at the Rokkasho-Mura reprocessing plant. This plant is under construction and does not yet contain any nuclear material. The case which has attracted publicity refers to the Tokai Mura nuclear fuel fabrication plant. Over the last six years of operation, the fuel fabrication process has resulted in the accumulation of layers of plutonium powder in parts of the plant. Approximately 70kg of plutonium has been `held up' in this way by adhering to the inner wall of parts of the process area. Operations are underway to recover the material, but it is in any case fully accounted for by the IAEA, measured on a monthly basis, and under full safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The safeguards measures applied by the IAEA in all non-nuclear weapon states party to the NPT are designed to attain the same assurances about the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes. Of necessity they differ in detail between different types of nuclear facility, and so from country to country. In the case of the DPRK, as stated in answer to (13), the IAEA's safeguards activities are designed to verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's declared inventory of nuclear materials. The verified inventory would then establish the basis for ongoing safeguards. In the case of Japan, the material referred to is part of Japan's safeguarded inventory of nuclear material to which an array of safeguards techniques are applied for verification purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware of press reports that there are elements within the French Government which have expressed themselves in favour of resumption of nuclear weapons testing by France despite the firm position taken by President Mitterrand in opposition to the resumption of testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia has been unflagging in its opposition to nuclear testing. The Government strongly opposes testing by France, or indeed any other nuclear weapon state. We have urged France on every available occasion to maintain its current testing moratorium. In doing so we have emphasised the adverse implications of resumed testing for France's relationship with the South Pacific. The Communique issued at the recent South Pacific Forum in Brisbane reiterated the same message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Australia's opposition to nuclear tests has been made clear to the French authorities, and publicly, on numerous occasions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are proceeding in the Conference on Disarmament.

Australia has expressed clearly its opposition to continued tests by China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia is a firm advocate of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. For many years Australia and New Zealand, together with Mexico, have sponsored an annual UN General Assembly resolution calling for the negotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In 1993, this resolution was co-sponsored by 156 countries&mdash;the highest in the Assembly's history&mdash;and passed for the first time by consensus. The prospects for concluding a Treaty are now very positive. Negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva continue to make encouraging progress, with the support of all nuclear weapon states. Australia has played an active role in advancing these negotiations, including through the tabling of a complete draft Treaty as a reference point for the Conference in developing agreed Treaty language. Early conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will directly help prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons. It will also, as a step towards nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapon states, improve the prospects for the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in April&mdash;May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Under present circumstances, French nuclear tests conducted in its Pacific territories do not formally contravene the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone (SPNFZ) Treaty. France has not signed the Protocols to the Treaty, as Australia and other South Pacific Forum countries have urged it to do. Protocol One would give effect to Treaty provisions within French territories in the nuclear free zone and in particular to Article 6 of the Treaty, which obliges parties to prevent and discourage nuclear testing within their territories by any State. Protocol </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three of the Treaty further obliges Nuclear Weapons States not to test any nuclear explosive device anywhere within the zone. Until France does sign the Protocols, the SPNFZ Treaty has no legal jurisdiction over French nuclear testing within French territories in the South Pacific. That said, resumed French testing would clearly run contrary to the whole thrust of the SPNFZ Treaty and to South Pacific opposition to testing in the region. It was for this reason that at the South Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane this year, Australia and other Forum countries again called on France, the UK and the US to accede to the Protocols of the Treaty as a demonstration of their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and a ban on testing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) While the World Summit for children expressed universal goals for improving the life of children, the needs and problems of children vary from country to country. These specific needs are identified in the National Programs of Action of countries to which Australia provides development cooperation. These guide the preparation of Australia's country-specific aid strategies and policy dialogue with those governments. In this way Australia aims to address the specific Summit goals by providing a coordinated aid program developed in partnership with recipient countries, and designed to complement and supplement their own national social programs as well as the activities of multilateral agencies and other donor countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's National Program of Action (NPA) outlines, inter alia, the additional efforts the Government is making in the area of the problems and needs of children in developing countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aid program's four-year $130 million population initiative, which supports programs such as child survival, safe motherhood and reproductive health alongside family planning was introduced in the 1993-94 Budget.

Australia is also continuing its health assistance focus on the Women and Children's Health (WATCH) theme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's development assistance to water supply and sanitation activities has increased from $5.5 million in 1991-92 to $30 million in 1993-94.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="955" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government has seen media reports that in June 1993 the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, which at the time was operated under contract by EG&amp;G Idaho Inc. and Westinghouse Idaho Nuclear Co., sold certain components of an unused nuclear fuel reprocessing plant as scrap to a private individual in the United States. This equipment is classed as "nuclear technology" under the United States export control system. The U.S. Department of Energy has stated that no export permit will be granted for this equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) States party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) employ a variety of national controls to regulate the possession and safe custody of nuclear material, as well as nuclear commerce. In countries conducting significant nuclear activities these measures typically include a system of licensing, physical protection, national safeguards to conform with the requirements of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, and export and import controls. Such measures are undertaken to fulfil the obligation of NPT parties not to contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general the controls governments exercise over the safe and secure custody and the export and import of nuclear material would apply to all persons in the territory of the relevant state, whether they are corporate citizens or individuals, and irrespective of nationality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, permits are required for the possession or transport of significant quantities of nuclear material and associated items. Exports of nuclear material and associated items are controlled through a permit system under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations to ensure that the Government's safeguards conditions are fully met. The Australian system does not distinguish between individuals and corporations except in the form of the penalties applied for non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As one of the most active and supportive proponents of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime based on the NPT, Australia is concerned about reports that individuals have attempted to circumvent national nuclear control systems. In the first instance it is for the countries involved to ensure that their national control systems are functioning effectively. This has been an issue of particular concern since the collapse of the former Soviet Union in view of the substantial amounts of nuclear material in former Soviet states. It has also been the subject of international attention and cooperation. International assistance has been provided through the IAEA and bilaterally to strengthen the control, accountability and physical protection of fissile material in these countries. The United States and Russia have concluded bilateral agreements covering the control and inspection of excess stocks of fissile material in former military use, and the purchase from Russia of highly enriched uranium from dismantled weapons for eventual civil power use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has contributed to international efforts to strengthen nuclear export controls and safeguards in former Soviet states by participating in an international export control mission to eight newly-independent states (NIS) in 1992. Australian officials also attended a workshop on safeguards in the NIS in Vienna last year, and in May 1994 the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) conducted a training course in conjunction with the IAEA on national safeguards systems. Although this course was primarily aimed at the East Asian region, the Australian government funded six participants from the NIS (3 from Kazakhstan, 2 from Uzbekistan and 1 from Azerbaijan).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In the case of nuclear material which is never imported into Australia, the nuclear material would be subject to the national export control regime of the exporting state. The material would be subject to IAEA safeguards in the importing country, as an NPT Party. In the case of supply from or through Australia, the nuclear material would be subject to the provisions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. In the case of undeclared or smuggled nuclear material such activity would also be subject to normal customs surveillance and interdiction. The Government is considering the introduction of legislation in the area of non-proliferation which would have extra-territorial effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The incident to which the question refers involved 62 grams of material found by police in May in a garage in Tengen, Germany. Analysis showed that the material was a powder mixture composed of a number of elements and containing glass fragments. About 10 percent, 6 grams, was plutonium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of greater concern is the discovery at Munich Airport on 10 August of 560 grams of material containing 350 grams of plutonium. A third incident on 12 August resulted in the arrest of a German national at Bremen Railway Station and the recovery of 2 grams of material containing 0.05 milligrams of plutonium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these amounts are significantly less than would be required for a nuclear weapon, this evidence of weaknesses in the national nuclear control systems of one or more countries is a very serious development. The Government is encouraged that Russian and German officials met on 20-22 August to discuss this issue and agreed on a set of practical cooperative measures to prevent illegal trafficking of nuclear materials in advance of the visit by President Yeltsin to Germany in early September. This issue is also expected to be taken up during the forthcoming summit meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In recent years there have been numerous reports of purportedly nuclear material described as "red mercury" smuggled from countries of the former Soviet Union. Information available to the Government indicates that the various materials which have been described as "red mercury" have no proliferation significance, and schemes for the sale of such material appear to have been confidence tricks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) As indicated in the answer to question (3), Australia has joined international efforts to strengthen national nuclear control regimes in the former Soviet states. Australia is a staunch advocate of measures to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. As the most recent incidents show, we cannot afford to be complacent about this and must continually work to strengthen the international community's capacity to deal with actual or threatened proliferation, whether by countries intending to acquire a nuclear weapons capability, or by individuals or groups seeking to exploit weaknesses in national nuclear control systems. Through its participation in international organisations, such as the IAEA, and international police and intelligence networks, Australia is well-placed to receive information about nuclear smuggling and to develop measures to counter it. Within Australia, nuclear activities are controlled under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The Act provides for fines and/or prison terms, for individuals and organisations that breach the Act's provisions. Standards for the safe and secure storage and use of nuclear material in Australia follow those laid down under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Australia's export control commitments are administered under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Australia will continue to work energetically for the indefinite extension in 1995 of the NPT as the key international framework for nuclear non-proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The safe and secure custody of nuclear material is primarily a national responsibility. The IAEA has a coordinating role in assisting the development of national systems for nuclear accountancy and control as a basis for the application of IAEA safeguards. This essentially preventive role is an integral part of the IAEA's safeguards program and is funded as part of the safeguards budget of the IAEA. The total safeguards budget for 1994 was equivalent to approximately $94 million (US$67.5 million). In addition, the IAEA sets standards for the physical security of nuclear material under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Almost all countries, including Australia, with the technical ability to supply significant quantities of nuclear material, equipment and technology are members of  the Nuclear Suppliers' Group and the Zangger Committee which set export control guidelines governing nuclear supply. Countering unauthorised trafficking when it occurs is essentially a matter for international police liaison and investigation outside the United Nations system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a), (b) and (c) The comments made by Air Commodore Peter Nicholson are not a true representation of the Government's views on East Timor. The Australian Government recognises Indonesia's sovereign authority over East Timor. This position was formalised by the then Coalition Government in 1979 and maintained by the Labor Government which came into office in 1983 and which, in August 1985, explicitly confirmed its recognition policy in a statement to Parliament by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke.</PARA>
