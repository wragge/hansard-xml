<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the House that the Federal Government and the State governments (except Tasmania) signed the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) in December 1992. The policy states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`until assessments are completed, forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.' (NFPS page 11)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This obligation is being totally ignored by the NSW Government. A prime example is in the high conservation value Deua Wilderness in southern NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the NFPS obligation, logging activities are continuing in both the Eastern and Western Deua Wilderness before the required assessments. This reckless approach to forest management threatens endangered species known to exist in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore ask the House to force the NSW Government to cease logging in the Deua Wilderness, and all other areas of high conservation value forest in the state. This will then allow assessments to be undertaken as required by the NFPS.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill brings into law two articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the right to privacy and the right to equality before the law. It is a response to the Government's so called Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 represents a narrow and inadequate approach to protecting the rights of gays and lesbians in our community. In fact, this bill exposes the Government's unwillingness to protect these rights, contrary to Australian Labor Party policy, Australia's international treaty commitments and to the Government's own rhetoric in both international and domestic arenas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In modern Australia there is a growing majority of people who accept that what happens in people's bedrooms is no basis for discrimination. Yet discrimination continues; on our streets, in our laws, even in this Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian governments need to shake off their homophobia and squeamishness about gays and lesbians and confront the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our experience in this country of confronting discrimination, whether sex, racial or disability discrimination, shows that laws on their own are not enough. Certainly legislation has powerful symbolic value and provides an avenue for appeal. However you can't legislate to force a change in the attitudes of individuals. Australia has the opportunity to create an innovative link between community education campaigns and law reform in order to eliminate discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the legislative sphere there is much that needs to change at all levels of government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens (WA) believe government decision making should occur as close as possible to the community who are affected by the decisions. In the case of many laws which affect gays and lesbians it is preferable that the states take the initiative to eliminate any discrimination. However, where states are recalcitrant we support Commonwealth intervention to ensure that our international human rights obligations are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most obvious areas of discrimination in the states are the anomalies between heterosexual and homosexual age of consent laws and the enactment of anti-discrimination laws. The states of Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory have a higher age of consent for homosexuals than for heterosexuals. Western Australian, Tasmania and Victoria have yet to introduce anti-discrimination legislation. Queensland's has a flawed anti-discrimination law which requires change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These states have exhibited a marked history of recalcitrance in initiating law reform to ensure equality for gays and lesbians. As long as this continues Australia is flouting its international human rights obligations, not to mention basic moral decency. The Federal Government has the clear and unequivocal responsibility and source of power to legislate where the states prove themselves inadequate. I call on the government to enact Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation based on sexual orientation as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Federal sphere a series of laws deny equality to gays and lesbians. These include laws relating to superannuation, social security, life insurance, industrial relations and the Marriage Act. The Commonwealth, as an employer is also yet to accord its gay and lesbian employees the same conditions as those of heterosexual employees. Although, the recent agreement between unions and the Taxation Department is a positive move in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gay and lesbian community around the world has been devastated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Laws in this country are yet to fully recognise the rights of people suffering from HIV or AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While legislation is a key area for reform, government policy must also keep pace with the changing community values. The Commonwealth has strategies and action plans in place for a number of portfolios which still fail to recognise the existence and needs of gays and lesbians in our community. For example we have a national action plan on violence which fails to address the abuse and physical threats that gays and lesbians are subjected to daily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a dire need for counselling services in smaller capitals and regional areas to offer information, help and support to the thousands of gays and lesbians in needs of such services. The Government's health and welfare policies continue to ignore this need. And there are many other examples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Going hand in hand with the need for legislative and policy change is the need for education. Fostering community awareness of the issues which confront gays and lesbians should not be dismissed as the soft option. A national education campaign, drawing directly from the experience and skills of the gay and lesbian community should be developed as a matter of priority, concurrent with anti-discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of law reform itself is an important opportunity for developing awareness and understanding. Through community debate and input people are able to express there fears and concerns. The law reform debate should not just be pushed by the gay and lesbian rights groups, but by a wide range of people interested in social justice in our community. Meaningful change will require a community approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Law Reform Commission is a useful vehicle for fostering understanding and airing of views on the road to legislative change. It seems incomprehensible that in the last decade of the twentieth century the Commission has yet to receive a referral from the Attorney-General on gay and lesbian law reform in Australia. I call on the Government to do so immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill which I have introduced today is in response to the insultingly weak legislation which the government has laid on the table. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 has little to do with human rights and its focus on sexual conduct rather than gays and lesbians as people is yet another insulting example of homophobia in the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It pains me to see this debate de-homosexualised at every turn. The coalition have erected the flimsy mask of states rights in front of their own inability to come to terms with developing a caring social policy. The government in turn has used this bill as a party political point scoring exercise, while at the same time having the audacity to laud this as a great step forward for gays and lesbians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one wants to talk about the rights of gays and lesbians to be able to walk down the street free from persecution, being able to show affection in public as our culture (and laws) allows opposite sex couples to do, to create nurturing families, to be free from discriminatory laws, to be valued and respected members of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy and Equality (ICCPR) Bill 1994 incorporates into domestic law the right to privacy and equality before the law. The bill enshrines this for all Australians. However, the practical affect is to afford groups in our community, such as gays and lesbians, the right to be free from arbitrary interference of privacy and enjoy equality before the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill fully implements our international human rights obligations with respect to privacy and equality before the law rather than a partial protection of privacy for sexual conduct. It creates a direct inconsistency between any state laws which are in conflict rather than the passive approach of the Government's which requires a challenge to the state laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is still a minimalist approach and no substitute for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation linked with an effective national education program. The gay and lesbian community deserve nothing less from this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly explain the Australian Democrats' position. Contrary to what was just said by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), it seems to me that the purpose of this motion is somewhat different from the audited reports to which the minister has drawn our attention. This motion draws attention to the fact that there are a number of reports between which there is conflict, and the Auditor-General in this case is being asked to give some opinion in relation to the conflict in that situation. It seems to me that, as the independent arbiter in this area, it is very appropriate for Senator Gibson's motion to go forward. It is not sufficient just to look at the ordinary audited reports. This is a different thing that the auditor is being asked to do and, under those circumstances, the Auditor-General is an appropriate person to carry out that study on material which, as the motion says, is already readily available, and to provide therefore an independent source of advice and interpretation to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I welcome this opportunity to table report No. 332 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which reviews two audit reports on the Australian government credit card. The first audit report was tabled in Parliament in December of last year and a follow up audit was tabled last June. Both reports attracted considerable public attention with occasional sensational articles appearing in the media. It was in this environment that the committee decided to review the credit card system and act, as it were, as the umpire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers overall that the Australian government credit card provides a useful purchasing tool for government agencies. However, there are areas at both the macro level&mdash;an oversight by the Department of Finance&mdash;and at the micro level&mdash;administration by individual agencies&mdash;where improvements can be made. In respect of the macro level, the committee recommended that responsibility for oversight of the credit card system should remain with the Department of Finance, as this fits well with Finance's role as administrator of the public account and oversight of financial management policy. Consequently, the committee does not support the Auditor-General's suggestion that the Department of Administrative Services be responsible for the management of the credit card system or be the sole supplier of training courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, credit card bills are paid through a system of agency settlement accounts. Although there is evidence that the settlement account system is not working as well as it should be, the committee is not convinced that the system should be abolished. Instead, the committee considers that the current system should be made to work better. We have recommended that various options to improve the system should be developed, tested and trialled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the micro level&mdash;administration of the credit cards by individual agencies&mdash;one of the main findings in the audit report was that departmental controls on the use of credit cards do not provide an adequate audit trail. Evidence received during our review showed that many of the card holders did not retain their yellow Mastercard dockets, let alone other documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee finds this a totally unacceptable practice and has recommended that all agency heads ensure that all card holders are fully conversant with their obligations; that there be random checking of supporting documentation; and that appropriate penalty mechanisms be introduced for non-compliance. Also, within agencies there are a significant number of credit card holders who do not use their card. We were told that this level was about 25 per cent, which is the normal rate as far as the general community is concerned but is higher than that for corporate cards issued by large business enterprises. The existence of inactive cards poses an unnecessary risk of fraud if the card is lost; an unnecessary administrative burden on agencies; and results in a financial loss to the Commonwealth of some $300,000 because of the annual card fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that credit cards be issued on a needs basis&mdash;not on the status of the officer concerned&mdash;and also that patterns of credit card usage be reviewed annually with a view to cancelling cards where the level of use cannot justify the expense. The committee also considered the issue of placing limits on individual transactions. This was because the merchant service fee usually ranges from 1.3 per cent to 3 per cent of the value of the transaction. Clearly if the item bought on the credit card is expensive, the fee can exceed the cost of alternative methods of payment. The first audit report, tabled in December 1993, gave an example of a credit card purchase of $900,000 where the merchant service fee was some $11,600. This contrasts with the costs associated with writing a cheque, estimated by the audit office as being about $13.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee declined to recommend a public service wide limit on individual transactions, but instead recommended that agencies should set their own limits based on their own typical purchase and expenditure patterns. As well, agencies should monitor all high value transactions to ensure that a cost effective approach was being used by individual card holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current credit card contract expires in June 1995, and the committee considers it is opportune for the Department of Finance to obtain feedback from agencies concerning their experiences with the credit card with a view to incorporating improvements in the new contract. Finance should examine options for incorporating new product developments and improved statistical analysis and management reporting into to the new contract. Also, the contract should be flexible enough to enable the Commonwealth to take advantage of any product or technological improvements which may emerge over the life of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that Commonwealth agencies operate in a devolved environment and are therefore responsible for administering the credit card system. Nevertheless, the committee considers that Finance, as the responsible central agency, should provide on-going guidance and support to individual agencies to help promote the efficient and consistent use of credit cards throughout the public service. An example of the role that we believe Finance should play is to develop general guidelines on the appropriateness or otherwise of expenditure on items such as travel, hospitality, conferences and other staff related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I note that, until the Auditor-General decided to conduct an audit, the credit card system had not been evaluated since its introduction in 1987. Although the committee has not endorsed all of Auditor-General's recommendations, I would like to commend the Audit Office for focussing attention on this important issue. I believe that the work undertaken by the audit office has already resulted in significant improvements in the operation of the credit card system. I believe that our recommendations will produce still further improvements. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>The terms of reference for the inquiry which led to this report focused on the issues associated with incineration as a means of disposal of waste and energy recovery.I wish to emphasise, however, that the committee considered this in the context of the waste minimisation hierarchy and as such considered that incineration and landfill should be used as a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary focus of policy and operational sectors of government should be waste minimisation, reuse and recycling. The committee agrees with the view put to it by some in submissions that there is no such thing as waste. Waste is nothing more than a resource that needs some innovative idea on how it can actually be used. Waste is a resource which, if used in the right quantity and in the right way, is recyclable or reusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that, if incinerators are to be constructed for the processing of domestic or municipal waste, there should be a requirement to have recycling and waste to energy facilities, and it has so recommended in its report. The committee does not support the construction of high temperature incinerators to deal with Australia's scheduled wastes, as it was given evidence during its inquiry that there are alternative technologies available.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that technologies designed to reuse or recycle be given priority and environmentally friendlier alternative technologies for the destruction of scheduled waste be considered in preference to high temperature incineration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's adherence to the Basel Convention, which prevents the export of hazardous wastes and the virtual ban on high temperature incinerator construction, has facilitated the development of a number of alternative technologies in Australia for the disposal of hazardous material. There has been a great deal of progress on various technologies since the work of the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste, and a number of innovative technologies could be operating commercially in the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee looked at a number of these technologies, which are described in the report. We do not, however, wish to comment on the relative effectiveness of these technologies or on their appropriateness for dealing with particular waste materials. These decisions will be made by the appropriate agencies and enterprises in terms of their commercial and public acceptability and technical requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was concerned at the lack of national standards for both the operations of incinerators and landfill sites. It therefore recommended the establishment of panels to act as independent facilitators in the settlement of disputes where communities and governments are unable to resolve the issues relating to the siting or the operation of disposal facilities and other waste management issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During the inquiry, some unsatisfactory aspects of current practice in the disposal of hospital waste were brought to the attention of the committee. As a result of a competitive tendering process, hospital waste from Sydney was being sent to Brisbane for incineration at what was alleged to be a substandard facility. It was also alleged that some of that waste would be sent on to Melbourne when the Brisbane facility was not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On at least one occasion when the Brisbane incinerator was not working it was alleged that medical waste was stockpiled in skips, covered only by polytarps, and stored in the open at the rear of the premises at a time when summer temperatures were around 40 degrees centigrade. The committee has therefore recommended that the government investigate the need for legislation relating to the transport of hospital wastes across borders and implement an appropriate strategy to reduce the risks associated with the transport and treatment of hospital wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic considerations of any proposed waste disposal facility should include direct and indirect environmental and social costs. Currently, these costs are rarely included. They should include costs such as subsidies for road construction and maintenance, traffic regulation, site supervision and monitoring, and the long-term maintenance of landfills. It is only when the full implications of waste are factored into the production process that industry will have a real incentive to minimise wastes created by its products and packaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend to employing private waste disposal companies has left the system open to a number of problems. Private companies tend not to have any incentive to reduce the amount of waste to be disposed of or to reduce the distance the waste is transported. The committee considered that these problems could be addressed by an effective regulatory and monitoring system operated by the relevant government authorities. The committee also believed that there should be independent panels which could provide advice to resident groups who felt they were disadvantaged by waste management arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not accept the argument that it is cheaper to use raw materials than to recycle products. There is a finite source of non-renewable raw materials and these should be conserved. The committee has therefore recommended that where technology is available, governments work with industry to encourage the use of recycled materials instead of raw materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that there still exists a great deal of confusion in the industry and in the broader community about the principles of the national waste minimisation and recycling strategy. Accordingly, the report recommends that, as a matter of urgency, the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency be required to establish formal and informal consultative processes with local, state and territory governments, industry and the broader community on all the major principles of waste management, particularly those relating to the national waste minimisation and recycling strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that there is an urgent need for a review of the current situation and approach to the strategy. It is more than two years since the strategy was adopted and there is still inadequate quantitative and qualitative information available to enable effective waste management decisions to be made. There is still a great deal of confusion and a lack of knowledge and understanding of key principles at the community level, within industry and at the local government level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This inquiry of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into waste disposal was one of the most enjoyable inquiries that I have participated in, in that it was most enlightening and I find the process of learning particularly enjoyable. It is a process which the committee members all undertook. I say that on behalf of other committee members who participated in the inquiry, knowing that we started the inquiry from one aspect of knowledge and that no committee members can say that they emerged from the inquiry without learning considerably more about this problem of what we do with waste material in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process involved the discovery also that many authorities in Australia that have the responsibility for disposing of waste also seemed to benefit from our inquiry. At one stage the chairman and I were particularly concerned about the fact that we seemed to be providing a vehicle for the dissemination of information between authorities rather than just gathering the information ourselves. Consequently, that particular process forms one of the recommendations, recommendation 15, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that emphasis be given to the prompt dissemination to local, State and Territory governments, industry and the broader community of the information collected in the review of available technology for the treatment of scheduled wastes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because we found examples of responsible authorities that were unaware of the developments in technology and in the management regimes. It is very important that they no longer remain ignorant of what is to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that was particularly important was that, during the process of investigating what possible technologies could be used to manage waste materials, the committee found that, if a commitment had been given to a total solution some years earlier&mdash;the best example was the high temperature incinerator&mdash;or to such a management regime, then of course Australia would not have benefited from the development of alternative treatment technologies, technologies which now have the potential to increase export opportunities for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak particularly in regard to the technology that is available now to treat the PCBs, the sort of material which was previously considered the prime candidate for disposal by high temperature incinerator. Australia has developed effective technology to deal with that material and is in a position to export that technology worldwide. That opportunity was created by the very step of not endorsing and establishing high temperature incineration. I believe that we have turned a threat into an opportunity, a quite beneficial opportunity, for Australia. That learning process was a part of the inquiry that I enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part that I did not enjoy&mdash;and, to be frank, I think other members of the committee felt the same&mdash;was the confusion and lack of cohesion and coordination in this area. We found that some authorities responsible for waste management were able to use best available technology and apply imagination and foresight in their planning for how to deal with what we normally consider waste; we found that other authorities seemed to be more concerned with perpetuating a set of practices which could be described only as destructive and costly, both in financial and sociological terms, to the communities to which they were responsible. That confusion and lack of coordination and cohesion should be addressed as a matter of urgency. I think the Commonwealth government has a role to play in leading the way in coordinating some of the efforts of those who are responsible for managing our waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction programs and waste volume reduction, but we see very little evidence of leadership by way of either example or financial assistance being applied, and there is plenty of room for this. That is an area which could be very productive in terms of achieving goals with comparatively little input either financially or in terms of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing that emerged as a result of the committee's work was an eagerness on behalf of local government to be involved in taking the opportunities that were identified, whether they be in recycling, in reuse or in reduction of waste. Local governments around Australia are seeing the opportunities to work very well on behalf of their communities, to take hold of the benefits that are available here. There is a need to communicate to local governments around Australia which may have the same problem what other local governments are doing. Again, there is the capacity for the Commonwealth to give leadership in making sure that that information is shared and that the opportunities are understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also an appreciation of the need to define waste disposal. We spent a fair amount of time in the committee trying to do this. At one stage we were even told that there is no such thing as waste, that waste is merely resources which have yet to be identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who introduced that concept to us was able to demonstrate his lateral thinking in determining and demonstrating a use for furnace dust, which was a problem in Wollongong, and sewage, which could both be identified as waste by one definition, but which he managed to demonstrate were resources when they were combined in the right way, using the technology that he had developed, and were capable of producing a product which had some intrinsic value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee enjoyed its exposure to such lateral thinking and such a productive exercise regarding Australia's resources. There we had an example of waste which was not waste. With regard to the attitude which can be applied to so many of the things we dispose of, particularly that which we dispose of in landfill, if we have the attitude that it is not really waste but merely a resource for which we should be looking for alternative uses, I think we will improve Australia's productivity, economy and employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important concept is that it is not merely sufficient to segregate and collect materials and say that that is recycling. To complete a recycling process it is necessary to repurchase the product of the recycled materials. We saw that local governments can play a significant role in that process, as can the Commonwealth government, particularly in terms of bounties for recycled paper or the use by purchasing departments of materials that have been made from recycled material.

<PARA>The annual reports included in this report relate to the year 1992-93 or the calendar year 1993 and were tabled in the Senate during the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994. The committee was due to have reported to the Senate by 30 June 1994 on its examination of annual reports but was granted an extension of time until 13 October 1994. The delay in reporting was caused by the committee's concerted effort to meet its deadline of 29 August to report on its inquiry into sexual harassment in the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's effort to finalise the sexual harassment report also resulted in a postponement since late 1993 of work on the committee's other inquiry into relations with China. The committee will now concentrate on completing this wide ranging inquiry. Earlier today the Senate granted the committee an extension of time until the last sitting day in June 1995 to report on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the annual reports examined by the committee were in accordance with the guidelines for preparing annual reports. In its previous report on annual reports, the committee had commented on the preponderance of female staff in the ASO 1 to 3 ranges and the progressive increases in the proportion of male staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The department recently wrote to the committee outlining the steps which it had taken to develop a strategy to integrate equal employment opportunity principles into the department's management practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was pleased to note that the secretary had taken the lead in developing this strategy. The committee believed that such action by the secretary should signal to all staff his determination to increase EEO principles in departmental management practices in accordance with the government's equal employment opportunity policy. Although the Department of Defence stated in its annual report for 1992-93 that there had been a small but significant increase in the number of women in the senior executive service levels, this statement was wrong. Other tables in the report showed that the number of women in the SES remained at five during the year. The department confirmed that no increase in numbers had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department also confirmed that two columns in table seven on page 274 of the report were also wrong because some categories of professional and technical staff had been included in the wrong salary ranges. There is little evidence to show that the department is making a serious attempt to integrate EEO principles in the department's management practices in order to improve the representation of female staff and their career prospects throughout the department. The employment of women in senior officer and senior executive range is still well below public service norms. The committee believes that the department management should make a more determined effort to improve its EEO record. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I welcome this opportunity to table the 331st report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is an advisory report on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901 and a response to a resolution by this chamber. On 28 June this year, Senator Robert Ray gave notice of a motion in the Senate to establish a joint standing committee to be known as the Audit Committee of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice of motion detailed the functions of the audit committee, in summary, as being: firstly, to advise the Auditor-General of the committee's audit priorities; secondly, to advise the responsible minister when the committee wishes a performance audit to be conducted on a government business enterprise; thirdly, to consider the resources of the Australian National Audit Office; and, finally, to report to the parliament on any issue arising out of the performance of the Auditor-General's functions or reports of the independent auditor that the committee believes should be drawn to the attention of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice of motion also proposed that the committee's membership be the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, alternating as chairman and deputy chairman; the chairman of the JCPA; two government and three opposition members of the House of Representatives; and one government senator, one opposition senator and one senator to be nominated by any minority groups or independent senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 June, the Senate passed a motion I moved, that the proposed resolution for the establishment of an audit committee should be referred to the JCPA for inquiry. The referral also requested the JCPA to give particular attention to the appropriateness of establishing a separate committee rather than conferring the functions of the proposed committee on the JCPA. On 23 August, the Senate agreed to extend the reporting deadline until today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware that on 29 June 1994, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced a package of three bills in the lower house. The bills were the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. For the sake of brevity, I shall refer to the bills respectively as the FMA Bill, the CAC Bill and the Auditor-General's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After their first reading in the House, the minister successfully moved that the bills be referred to the JCPA for review with an advisory report to be presented to the House. The JCPA decided to combine its report on the proposal to establish an audit committee and its review of the three bills into the one report. Let me say at the outset that the JCPA has welcomed the opportunity to consider the Senate's referral and to review the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's review has allowed many Commonwealth entities and organisations outside the Commonwealth an opportunity to comment on the proposed audit committee and the three bills. The committee received 65 submissions and held six public hearings, with witnesses coming from as far afield as South Australia and Tasmania to give evidence. The committee also invited the coalition, the Australian Democrats and all Independent senators and members to consider their comments. The review process has been important and valuable. The committee believes that the constructive and bipartisan approach of all involved in the inquiry has led to recommendations that will enhance the effectiveness of an audit committee and the quality of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I detail some of the major recommendations made by the committee, I should like to draw the Senate's attention to the long involvement of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in moves to have an audit committee of parliament established. The formal motion to establish an audit committee of parliament draws heavily on a proposal to establish such a committee made by the same committee in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that year the Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed the audit office and, in its report No. 296 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament&mdash;Reform of the Australian Audit Office</EMPHASIS>, recommended the establishment of a separate parliamentary audit committee. This recommendation was based on the precedent of the UK House of Commons, which had established a statutory audit committee called the Public Accounts Commission in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's interest in establishing an audit committee is particularly welcomed by the committee. However, the notice of motion proposes creation of a separate audit committee, a move proposed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1989. The committee now considers that, for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness, the functions of an audit committee should be more appropriately conducted by the JCPA itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has come to this conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, the public accounts committee has a long history of liaising with the Auditor-General. This has given the public accounts committee members a strong understanding of the issues affecting the Auditor-General and his office. Secondly, the public accounts committee has a statutory obligation to examine the reports of the Auditor-General. Public accounts committee members have developed a detailed insight into the Auditor-General's levels of activity and the efficiency with which they are carried out. With this information, the public accounts committee members are well placed to comment on the Auditor-General's proposed levels of future activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the public accounts committee already acts informally as a conduit for parliamentarians to indicate aspects of public administration that they would like the Auditor-General to examine. If the audit committee functions were added to its responsibilities, the public accounts committee would undertake this task on a formal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not believe it appropriate for Australia to follow the United Kingdom precedent, where the House of Commons audit committee and the public accounts committee are separate. The reason for this separation in the UK is that by tradition the chairman of its public accounts committee is, by convention, a member of the opposition. It was not considered appropriate for the opposition to preside over a committee reviewing the appropriations of an agency of state, and thus the function was given to a separate government controlled committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar separation is not necessary in Australia, given that the chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is always a government member. However, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts believes that it is highly desirable that an audit committee of parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that statutory recognition can be most appropriately achieved by amending the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951. This act details the membership, duties and functions of the public accounts committee and should be amended to give the public accounts committee the additional powers to perform the functions of a parliamentary audit committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA believes it is important that its functions as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. To clarify the distinction, the public accounts committee believes that the Public Accounts Committee Act should require the committee to convene as the audit committee of parliament when performing audit committee functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that minority parties and Independents should be represented on the audit committee. This is most appropriately achieved by increasing the membership of the public accounts committee by one and reserving the extra position for a representative of any minority groups or Independents in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that these recommendations will give the parliament a strong and efficient audit committee that will strengthen the links between the Auditor-General and the parliament. As I mentioned, the public accounts committee decided to combine its report on the audit committee proposal and its review of the three bills to replace the Audit Act into the one report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall now focus on the committee's major recommendations concerning the replacement legislation. The Auditor-General Bill defines the powers, functions and role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The public accounts committee welcomes the introduction of the Auditor-General Bill and supports the principles behind the legislation. In particular, the committee welcomes the fact that the Auditor-General has been given an unambiguous mandate to audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities and almost as extensive a mandate to conduct performance audits. The decision to establish the audit office as a statutory agency is also a positive step. However, the committee believes that the bill, as proposed, represents a limitation on the parliament's capacity to make informed assessments about the efficiency with which taxpayers' money is being used by government business enterprises. Clauses 14 and 15 of the bill only allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of business enterprises at the request of both houses of parliament by resolution or at the request of the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bill does allow parliament to request a performance audit of a business enterprise, the committee believes that to require a resolution of both houses is cumbersome, time consuming and potentially impractical. It is important that there be an easier mechanism by which the parliament can directly request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee recommends that parliament delegate its authority to request a performance audit of a GBE to the proposed audit committee, without the need to go through the responsible minister or both houses. Of course, parliament as a whole and the responsible minister would continue to be able to request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE. The committee expects that the audit committee would rarely exercise this power and only after consultation with all parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall briefly mention the other two bills: the Financial Management and Accountability Bill and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. The FMA Bill establishes an appropriate structure for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies and, in fact, the committee has made only two minor recommendations for change. Finally, I turn to the CAC Bill. At present, the accountability requirements for Commonwealth authorities and companies are scattered through numerous enabling acts, company memoranda and articles of association. The CAC Bill draws these together in a single set of core reporting and accountability requirements. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to stress three of the principles about the Audit Committee of Parliament that have arisen from the joint committee's recommendations. Firstly, the joint committee believes that it is highly desirable that an audit committee of the parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. As has been discussed, the joint committee recommends that this be achieved by way of amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the joint committee believes that its function as an audit committee should be very clearly distinct from its traditional functions.

Thirdly, the committee believes that minority parties and independents should be represented on the audit committee. Senator Gibson, in presenting the report, has indicated that the committee recommends the membership of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts be increased by one and that that extra position be reserved for representatives of the minority groups or Independents within the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse what Senator Gibson has said. These recommendations, together with the various other recommendations in the report, will, the committee believes, ensure a strong and efficient audit committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the joint committee report also reviews the package of three bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. Those bills are: the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight some of the recommendations that the committee made regarding the Auditor-General Bill. One of the recommendations made by the Auditor-General was that the Auditor-General Bill should be amended to provide the audit office with the authority to establish appropriate terms and conditions of employment of staff. Currently, audit office staff are employed under the Public Service Act 1922 and this arrangement will continue under the Auditor-General Bill as it currently stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his submission, the Auditor-General argued that he needed to be able to set terms and conditions for his staff that are competitive with private sector equivalents because that would give him or her the flexibility to meet changing requirements. The government's 1987 policy guidelines for Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises state that statutory authorities should be staffed under the Public Service Act unless there are strong reasons for doing otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's view, a case has not been made out to exempt the National Audit Office from this policy position. Furthermore, the Department of Finance has pointed out that there are many other Commonwealth agencies besides the National Audit Office that have difficulty providing professional staff with competitive remuneration packages. So it is not an issue that is unique to the audit office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the committee believes that the Auditor-General is in a unique position in the public sector given his or her vital role in strengthening the accountability of the executive to parliament and improving public sector efficiency. The committee believes that the Auditor-General's capacity to undertake these functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. This would assist the Auditor-General in attracting and retaining the highest quality staff. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow the Auditor-General to negotiate the terms and conditions of the staff at the audit office with those officers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee is aware of the concerns expressed by the employees' representatives during the proceedings that the terms and conditions of staff could possibly be eroded if they were no longer employed under the Public Service Act. It is the committee's view that it should be possible to balance the Auditor-General's desire to have freedom to determine competitive packages for his staff with the requirement to protect their basic terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be achieved by placing safeguards in the legislation along the lines of those included in the enabling legislation of other budget funded Commonwealth authorities not employing staff under the Public Service Act. So the committee has recommended that the terms and conditions set by the Auditor-General must be consistent with government industrial relations and employment policies and the principles decided by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the process of establishing terms and conditions of the audit office staff is likely to be complex and lengthy, involving negotiations between all relevant parties. For this reason, we recommend that audit office staff should continue to be employed and appointed under the Public Service Act until such time as any new terms and conditions are agreed with staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation made by the Auditor-General is that former Auditors-General should not be able to take up further employment in the public sector. The Auditor-General is concerned that there could be seen to be implications for the independence of the Auditor-General if an Auditor-General is reliant on the executive for future employment when his or her term of appointment is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges that the position of Auditor-General is unique and has a special place within the system of government. However, inclusion of such an amendment to the bill would prevent a former Auditor-General from making a further and valuable contribution to Commonwealth administration. Accordingly, the committee believes that there should not be a restriction on former Auditors-General seeking offices of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn briefly to another of the bills in the legislative package: the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill, known as the CAC Bill. A matter of concern to a number of witnesses appearing before the committee was that the penalty regime established under the CAC Bill for breaches of duty by executive officers of Commonwealth authorities is unnecessarily harsh. An associated concern was that Commonwealth authorities will find it increasingly difficult to attract quality men and women to fill positions on boards of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is aware of the trend in the private sector towards boards being filled by professionals skilled in financial management, as non-financial experts become reluctant to accept the more onerous obligations being placed on directors. The committee believes it desirable that the boards of Commonwealth authorities and companies should contain a mix of financial experts and community representatives with relevant, although not necessarily financial, expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It believes also that the penalty regime for executive officers in the CAC Bill should not discourage appropriate people from sitting on the boards of Commonwealth authorities. On the other hand, it should also reflect the high standard of duty and care that parliament expects of people undertaking a public duty. In order to ensure that there is no confusion regarding the definition contained in the bill, the committee has recommended that the explanatory memorandum be amended to state that the individual circumstances of each particular case will be relevant in determining whether an officer of a Commonwealth authority should be classified as an executive officer or not with respect to the penalty regime. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee welcomes the introduction of the CAC Bill, principally because it will enable Parliament to view the accountability requirements of the vast range of Commonwealth authorities and companies as a whole. Furthermore, it will ensure that the accountability requirements are explicit and consistent for each class of Commonwealth entity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I believe that the review process that has culminated in this report has been valuable and conducted in a constructive spirit. The notice of motion to establish an audit committee of parliament and the legislation combined, represent a landmark package aimed at improving the framework of Commonwealth financial administration and strengthening the accountability of the public sector to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the Committee's recommendations will further enhance this package and lead to even more accountable and efficient public sector management.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee has supported the CAC Bill's penalty regime for executive officers who breach their duties, but recommended that the Bill be amended to allow relief from prosecution in cases where there are extenuating circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the penalty regime of the CAC Bill, `executive officers' of Commonwealth authorities are liable to pay compensation or damages, as well as face fines and prison terms, for failure to comply with a range of obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill defines executive officers in Commonwealth authorities as the directors of an authority and `any other person who is concerned, in, or takes part in, the management of the authority'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of Commonwealth authorities questioned whether this definition is so broad as to include relatively junior management. The implication being that junior staff could also be liable to pay fines and compensation or face prison.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges the potential confusion that may arise from the vagueness of the definition, but notes the following advice from the Attorney-General's department, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition has deliberately been cast in a general fashion to ensure that the question of whether a person is an executive officer will depend on the facts of the particular case and the actual activities that the person undertakes on behalf of the company rather than the actual title or position of the relevant person in the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee has recommended that some confusion can be avoided by amending the Explanatory Memorandum to state that the individual circumstances of each particular case will be relevant in determining whether an officer of a Commonwealth authority should be classified as an executive officer or not.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with Commonwealth government responsibilities in respect of providing benefits to students within Australian higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the continued support of existing student services within Australian higher education institutions through an amendment to the act which will allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly and recover funds from the States' General Revenue Assistance if necessary. The bill will also allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly for certain permitted purposes. The recovery of funds will be possible under the provision contained in section 15 of the States Grants (General Purpose) Bill 1994. This mechanism ensures that there will be no additional budgetary implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions contained in the bill will override the provisions of any state law or any other action the state may take to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is a direct result of the Tertiary Education (Amendment) Act 1994 (the act) passed by the Victorian government and the actions of the Tasmanian state government towards the University of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian act purports to abolish compulsory student unionism while protecting the provision of specified services to students. While the provisions of this act were being debated in the Legislative Assembly amendments were made, after considerable pressure from the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee and the National Union of Students to increase the range of services funded from non-academic fees. While the Victorian minister may add to the list of approved services by regulation there is a danger that the list specified by regulation will limit the services and amenities available to students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a number of activities and services such as student newspapers, student advocacy and generally activities of a representational nature will not be provided for. The Victorian act also places restrictions on the use of profits from activities funded from the compulsory non-academic fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Victorian government has legislated against student organisations, the Tasmanian government has used the Victorian act as a precedent to exert pressure on the University of Tasmania to conform to state government demands. The University of Tasmania has agreed to amend the university ordinances relating to the payment and use of fees for student association membership at the university. All students will continue to pay a compulsory student association fee but any student who objects to their funds being directed to the Student Representative Council (SRC) will have their fee dedicated to the provision of student services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditionally the role of the SRC has been important in meeting a range of non-academic needs of students on campus. The Commonwealth government will challenge the state Governments to protect the rights of students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action taken by the Tasmanian and Victorian governments have the potential to affect the culture and quality of services and amenities at universities. Their intervention is a direct attack on the autonomy of higher education institutions. Institutions and student organisations should jointly be able to make decisions about the imposition, collection and use of fees for the provision of services and amenities, independent of government interference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By restricting students' expression of views on public issues the Victorian government has cynically flouted the international instruments and principles which it had originally claimed to be the basis of its legislative action. Making the expenditure of fees levied by the institution dependent upon state governments' views of what is `appropriate' effectively amounts to the choking of open debate of government policies as they affect the institution and the student body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value and need for compulsory student unionism has been endorsed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and student organisations around Australia. This principle is in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article 22 concerning Freedom of Association. Furthermore, most if not all institutions allow for conscientious objection to the membership of student organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian act prohibits the acceptance by universities of financial assistance from the Commonwealth for a student  organisation as a result of the state preventing or hindering the imposition or collection of fees, a provision currently contained within section 25a of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 will allow the Commonwealth to make payments directly to student organisations for the purpose of enabling those organisations to continue to provide `benefits' to students and maintain funding support at a viable level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth, through this amendment, will ensure that institutions maintain an environment that fosters the necessary culture and atmosphere for students to exchange ideas, hold and express opinions in a free and unimpeded manner.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice of motion altered on 20 September 1994 pursuant to Standing Order 77</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion seeks to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts the matter of the international convention on desertification. Honourable senators will recall that, at the time this motion was put forward, Senator Chapman also put forward a motion to refer the same matter, but with different terms of reference, to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. That motion was defeated, and this motion is the alternative proposal. This motion seeks to refer this convention and its impact in relation to a number of matters in Australia, which I will pick up in a moment, to the environment, recreation and the arts committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving this motion and on other occasions, I have drawn attention to the fact that, in relation to international conventions and international obligations, the federal government has often entered into agreements which have bypassed the proper democratic processes of parliament. We have seen numerous examples of this. For instance, we have given effect to the London Dumping Convention in local law. When one sought to tighten the provisions in that piece of legislation, one was told that one could not change one full stop or comma in the legislation because it had already been agreed to in an international forum. Similarly, by analogy at the state level under intergovernmental agreements within Australia, one often finds that governments have entered into agreements and the parliaments are presented with legislation which cannot in any way be modified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a general concern in the parliament. That concern&mdash;which is certainly shared by the opposition, and to some extent by the government&mdash;is that these international conventions should, in some way, be brought before the parliament, and the parliament should have an opportunity to look at them and make some comment upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are the elected representatives of the Australian people. We have a responsibility, therefore, to ensure that we have a chance to look at what our government is entering into on our behalf. When it comes to legislation that gives effect to conventions, we also need to be able to make serious and sensible comments on them with a right to amend them if we do not like the provisions or we feel that the provisions are not strong enough. That has not been the situation up until this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is wide agreement with the opposition that that is an area of quite serious concern. Senators will know that Senator Vicki Bourne is intending to have legislation debated in this chamber in relation to that matter. In a sense, motions of this sort are a first attempt to go down the road of democratising the processes in relation to international agreements, conventions and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Chapman moved his motion, we believed that there was a certain misconception about this specific convention on desertification in that the desertification convention relates to the countries which are provided with aid in relation to desertification and, therefore, Australia in itself would not be subjected to any provisions within that desertification convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have as world citizens a responsibility in relation to environmental protection and the effect of desertification. There might be some argument about this, which can be looked at by the committee to which this matter is referred. Senator Chapman earlier quoted two Oxford scientists who had done work on desertification and were claiming that desertification had not advanced as far as many other people were claiming and that there was something of a beat-up in relation to desertification. Leaving that matter aside, we see the question of desertification very much as an environmental matter, in relation to this convention. As I said, as world citizens, we have a responsibility to look at that. While the social and other consequences are significant, the primary concern should be that of the environment. That is why we have chosen to refer this convention to the environment committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there has been a great deal of misunderstanding in the Australian rural community about the impact of this convention on people in rural areas. We believe that the convention will not have impacts on those people, but in deference to Senator Chapman's concern&mdash;I hope he notices this&mdash;the last term of reference of this committee has been modified to take those matters into account. The committee can look at those matters and, if it finds that we are right that there will not be economic and social impacts on rural people, that will be reported. Hopefully, that process will help to lay to rest those unfounded concerns which people in the rural community have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, therefore, draw Senator Chapman's attention to clause (e). The original motion referred to `the impact of the desertification convention on the sustainability of rural, pastoral and mining communities'. It now reads `the impact of the desertification convention on the economic, social and environmental sustainability of rural, pastoral and mining communities'. I believe that picks up the concerns Senator Chapman expressed in his original motion, the motion which was rejected by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the opposition will see fit to support this motion. It will clearly achieve the first objective, which was to bring the convention before a committee of the Senate. In relation to the specific concerns which Senator Chapman voiced, I believe that they have been taken care of in that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was our understanding that the government would support this reference to the environment committee but was not prepared to support Senator Chapman's reference. I have just had an indication from the government that it is not now supporting the reference. I had hoped that it would, because it is a serious matter if the government enters into these international agreements and conventions while bypassing the democratic processes and elected representatives of the people of Australia, who should have some input into the acceptance, modification or otherwise of these international conventions. I am surprised that the Labor Party, which prides itself on being a democratic party, evidently seeks to continue a situation in which government can go ahead unilaterally and do these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often argued that governments are the bodies elected to make these sorts of decisions and that they have a mandate to do that. But at election time governments and political parties never set out that they intend to enter into this, that and the other agreement. That is not part of their charter. It is therefore not part of their mandate to enter into those agreements without bringing those agreements back before the elected representatives&mdash;before the House of Representatives and the Senate. Therefore, I am rather surprised that the government on this occasion is not prepared to accede to this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly recommend to the opposition that it support this motion because it does achieve, I believe, the objectives of its original request. It is somewhat broader in that it recognises and emphasises the environmental aspects. It picks up the concerns which those opposite have expressed in relation to the democratic process. It also picks up their concerns in relation to the impacts of this convention on rural people because it specifically talks about the economic and social impacts on rural, pastoral and mining communities. That has been done by way of amendment. Therefore, I strongly urge the opposition to accept this motion and to support it. </PARA>

<PARA>Those terms of reference indicate that this motion is a rather unsubtle attempt by the Democrats to engage in a pea and thimble trick. What the Democrats are doing by proposing this reference is using the international convention on desertification as an excuse to promote a wide-ranging environmental inquiry in Australia. That is an inquiry that is simply not needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his remarks when moving this reference, Senator Coulter claimed that there was a misconception regarding this convention in relation to Australia because it relates to countries which are provided with aid to deal with the environmental problem of desertification. In saying that, of course, Senator Coulter is completely ignoring the potential domestic impact of this convention through the capacity it gives the federal government yet again to abuse its external affairs power under the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also indicated that this inquiry really is, as I said, a pea and thimble trick, by saying that the environment is the most important issue in relation to this convention. There is no doubt about the importance of the environment, but the environmental issues in relation to desertification in Australia are already being handled in a number of satisfactory ways. They are already the subject of the landcare inquiry that is being carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. There are a number of programs underway to deal with the particular environmental problems that relate to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has not been properly investigated is the potential impact of this convention on Australia and, as I particularly referred to a few moments ago, its impact in relation to the power it gives the federal government under the external affairs power. As I said, if we are going to have an inquiry into this convention, that should be the focus of the inquiry not the Australian environment, which is already subject to adequate inquiry in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the last term of reference in Senator Coulter's motion, which asks the committee to look at the impact of the convention on economic, social and environmental sustainability of rural, pastoral and mining communities, does, to some extent, attack that issue. But I suggest that that is merely a sop to try to persuade our side of this chamber that we ought to support what really is an inquiry focused in an entirely different direction. It is not adequate simply to tack on at the end of Senator Coulter's terms of reference one term of reference that looks at one particular aspect of that convention when the whole thrust of the inquiry is in a different direction altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the inquiry that Senator Coulter has proposed on behalf of the Australian Democrats is simply not needed. The terms of reference put forward by Senator Coulter divert attention from the main issues which surround this United Nations convention.

These are the important issues that relate to Australia's intention to sign and subsequently ratify this convention on desertification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the issues which my proposed reference to the rural and regional affairs committee of the Senate would have addressed had it been carried successfully when it was debated in this chamber a couple of weeks ago. These are the issues of real concern to Australians, especially those living in rural and regional areas. But sadly, these are the issues to which the Democrats, along with the Greens and the government, paid scant regard when they voted two weeks ago to defeat that proposed inquiry. Instead, they now want to initiate a wide-ranging, unnecessary inquiry into desertification in Australia, an issue which, as I have already said, is being addressed and indeed is already the subject of an inquiry by the Senate rural and regional affairs committee in its landcare investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter in the debate a couple of weeks ago argued that he would not support my reference of the convention to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;and he repeated it again today&mdash;because in his view it would not apply to Australia. If that is the case, we have to look at his attempted reference today as a rather cynical and transparent attempt to confuse the issue and to manipulate the political agenda, with the possible intended outcome of affecting the national rangelands management strategy, when he knows he does not have the support of either the opposition or the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's narrowing of the context to examine desertification only in Australia ignores the substantial nature of the convention, which places Australia in the category of affected developed country which will not receive assistance but which is required to provide assistance to affected developing countries. Examining desertification in Australia does not go to the problem of the extent to which aid is necessary to assist developing countries. The reference which I sought a couple of weeks ago would have examined the potential domestic policy implications of implementation of the convention on Australia. That, as I have already said, is a quite separate issue but it is the key issue with regard to this convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of Senator Coulter's reasons for seeking this particular reference, as he said in his remarks a couple of weeks ago, was the impact of population growth on the incidence of desertification. Given the Australian context of today's motion, that is rather irrelevant and inconsistent. Australia's rural regions have actually experienced negative population growth; they have experienced falls in population. Senator Coulter well knows that. Population considerations are therefore not relevant to desertification as an issue in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inescapable fact is that the impact of the convention on domestic policy will mostly affect rural and regional Australians. Consequently, it is that earlier reference that should have been undertaken if we were really concerned about the impact of this convention. Senator Coulter's motion pays lip-service to the international nature of the convention by seeking examination of the capacity of the desertification convention to contribute to Australia's efforts to halt and reverse desertification both within Australia and overseas. It ignores the consequences for Australia of being bound at international law, of handing over its national sovereignty and providing the Australian government with the legislative capacity, through the capricious exercise of the external affairs power, to centralise control of rural land management.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts seems extremely sensitive this morning. I was not even referring to the Greens; I was referring to the Australian Democrats. I assume that her remarks related to my comment that Senator Lees, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, was running around South Australia cuddling up to farmers in rural communities. I do not see any sexist connotation in that remark. Males or females can cuddle up. I do not see why it should be regarded as being particularly disparaging of females.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying before that interruption, Senator Lees runs around South Australia purporting to be the friend of farmers and the rural community. Yet we have the Democrats proposing a wide-ranging inquiry, completely ignoring the potentially detrimental impact of this convention on rural communities. They are looking at only one side of this issue rather than taking a balanced approach. They are really ignoring the main issue of this convention as it potentially impacts on rural and regional Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issues seem to have totally escaped the Democrats with regard to this proposal, because the real issues are not the impact of desert regions in Australia or the extent of deserts, or even what is required in Australia to halt and reverse desertification. They are quite different issues. The first is whether it is appropriate that Australia deal with desertification as an environmental problem and as a social and political problem in Australia&mdash;or in Africa, Latin America, the Mediterranean or the Caribbean&mdash;through the mechanism of an international bureaucratic body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the United Nations environment program's scandalous mounting of a publicity campaign based on flawed scientific evidence on a subject largely misunderstood even at the international scientific level, purely to manipulate the global environmental political agenda and attract aid funding to maintain its own bureaucratic hierarchy. I addressed that in some detail in my remarks on the earlier proposed reference a couple of weeks ago&mdash;and I do not need to add anything more to that today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third is an issue which the Democrats have ignored in their proposed reference: the usurpation of Australian sovereignty by an international committee and the stifling of democracy in this country by not allowing the public some foreknowledge as to how their lives and livelihoods may be affected by Australia's accession to this convention. The government has given no indication as to how this convention may be implemented in this country. That the government has chosen not to do so but instead has displayed a willingness to sign away our sovereignty without confronting the Australian public's legitimate concerns should ring alarm bells, even for the Democrats. But it seems to have failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we should not forget that, when former Senator Richardson was minister for the environment and was questioned on this issue, he refused to rule out&mdash;I think it was Senator O'Chee who asked the question&mdash;the possibility of the Australian government at some future date using the external affairs power that it would have under the signing of this convention to impose its will with regard to rangelands management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The signing of this convention represents an almost certain potential for abuse of the external affairs power to further control land management in Australia, to override state laws and to centralise federal government power in the process. It should be noted that this ludicrous situation has not escaped some of those on the government's side. A former Labor minister, Peter Walsh, in an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 12 July, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not and never have been a monarchist but find it ironic that so many contemporary Australians determined to protect us from the non-existent threat of English tyranny, fall over each other in a scramble to surrender Australian sovereignty to a ragtag and bobtail of unrepresentative UN committees accountable to nobody.</PARA>
<PARA>I say, `Hear, hear!' to that. Of course, he is not the only senior Labor figure expressing concern about the federal government's abuse of power. Only this week, the Queensland Labor Premier, Mr Goss, launched a detailed criticism of the federal government's approach. Premier Goss is therefore now on common ground with the Liberal state premiers&mdash;and, I might say, on this issue he is on common ground with us in the federal opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is an obvious overlap in terms of the environmental impact of desertification&mdash;and perhaps the Democrats have taken into account in this proposal my criticisms of the wide-ranging and conflicting scientific evidence and have attempted to clarify the nature of desertification&mdash;one cannot ignore that Australia's existing programs and inquiries are already examining this issue in the Australian context. I must repeat that the emphasis of Senator Coulter and the Democrats in this proposed reference represents both a duplication of, and an interference in, that process that is already under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of Australians are preoccupied with a national drought of crisis proportions. This convention is something which they simply do not want. To them, it is unnecessary and it is irrelevant. If we need to provide assistance through aid and technology exchange to other countries that are suffering from this problem, that can be readily accommodated through our existing bilateral and multilateral aid provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps if the government came clean on how it proposes to implement the convention and addressed some more relevant Australian concerns, instead of indulging in this preoccupation with international posturing and centralisation of power, the Australian community in general&mdash;not to mention those of us in the opposition&mdash;might feel a little more charitable in regard to the government's approach to international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by summarising that the signing of an international convention and the consequent domestic policy impact is not a matter for a wide-ranging environmental inquiry as proposed by the Democrats. The most unsatisfactory aspect of Senator Coulter's motion today, apart from the inconsistencies on which it is based, is that it is an attempt to manipulate the environmental agenda in this country for political point scoring purposes. It is quite senseless to attempt to turn every issue into an environmental issue regardless of the nature of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that an attempt to do that is nothing more than political opportunism and political cynicism, and that is something the Australian public, I believe, would find unacceptable. So it is on that basis that the opposition certainly will not be supporting this motion for the signing of the convention to be referred, on the basis provided by the Democrats, to a committee for investigation. I urge the Senate likewise to vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This convention arises because of global concern that the planet earth is increasingly turning to desert, the areas of natural environment are in decline, the areas of rangeland and cultivatable land are in decline, deserts are taking over and, most importantly, that is occurring in Third World countries but not only there. Australia is a First World country. Arguably, that phenomena that we are witnessing is occurring here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that global problem, governments of the world believe that an international solution must be found and international action must be mounted, and that action mounted in one country to solve the problem may not even help in that particular country if there is not unified action elsewhere. This is a classic case of the United Nations playing a role for the planet. This is a classic case where international cooperation and action is necessary. It is as a consequence of that universally perceived view that this convention has come to life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure of the exact number of countries which have been involved in the process of hammering out this convention. I might be wrong, but I think it is 112. We have a convention which is the product of the labours of 112 different countries&mdash;all with different political systems, all with different political views and different responses to the development versus environment debate. But they are united in the view that we cannot let the globe go the way it is going without taking an international stand, and that point unified everybody. As a consequence of all that diversity and difference, there is now an international convention in which Australia has played an important part in bringing to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations succeeds in getting global action on a major issue, it ought to be applauded. It is a miracle in itself to get 112 countries to agree on anything; yet we have universal international agreement at the negotiating table for a convention on a serious matter. The trouble is that, when it gets to Australia, it falls foul of what I regard as petty domestic politics, and those petty domestic politics overwhelm the vision of what is necessary here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the United Nations does something which stimulates the world, people say, `Good on the United Nations. What a fantastic system.' The United Nations system tends to be mired down in squabbling and detail and unable to act cleanly and effectively. This is an occasion on which it can act cleanly and effectively. The detractors say, `We haven't had enough time to consider this. We should not have to vote on it. This is anti-democratic. It is a usurpation of the constitutional powers.' They make criticisms of that nature. But here is a global problem; and here is a unified global response. On 14 October the government will play its global role in supporting this international convention by signing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go to the detail of this motion, I want to deal with two of the threshold arguments put forward, firstly, by the Democrats and, secondly, by the opposition. The Democrats&mdash;without denying the larger picture at all and to be fair to them&mdash;would emphasise the larger picture in stronger and more colourful terms than perhaps I have. I note for the record that Senator Coulter is nodding his agreement to that point. I express to Senator Coulter that I think that would be the case. That in no way denies our commitment to it, but his tendency would be to express that more strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Democrats say that there should be greater parliamentary debate, that it is a usurpation of power by the executive for the terms of this convention not to be subject to greater parliamentary debate and somehow that is undemocratic. I put it to Senator Coulter in these terms: there are 112 countries, if my figures are right, involved in this. We are one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required here is firm across-the-board unified international action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be a simple and democratic way of doing it&mdash;and there is in Australia. That is found in our constitution. It has been given to the Commonwealth government by our constitutional forefathers in their wisdom. The Commonwealth government of Australia has the power under the constitution to enter into these conventions. If the Commonwealth then wants to apply those conventions within Australia and wants to legislate to do so, it has to come to the parliament for the right to apply them.

It is a recipe for preventing action, not a recipe for doing anything. It is a recipe for avoiding the point, not reinforcing the point. It is a recipe for befuddling the community, not galvanising it around a perceived public need.

It is an argument that has no basis in foundation.

In the case of this convention, we are exercising our power quite properly after widespread consultation in the community about an international problem that requires urgent action.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not signing away our sovereignty; we are in fact reinforcing our sovereignty as our constitutional forefathers have framed the constitution. I am one of those people who think that the Australian constitution is inadequate in many respects and ought to be changed. But I will argue that in the proper forums at the proper time. This is a power in the constitution and the government is entitled to exercise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the arguments as to why we will not support this motion. The first argument is that the government has consulted widely with interested parties at every stage of these negotiations. The government has invited contributions widely within Australia in relation to the development of Australia's objectives for this convention. We have acted on that advice and sought to have those objectives enshrined in this international convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from that community consultation, our objectives are: the convention itself should be international in scope but should provide for the development of regional, national and local plans and programs to combat desertification; it should ensure that it has addressed the underlying causes of what is turning land into deserts, including environmental causes, human behaviour and socio-economic factors; and it should include specific and remedial measures to turn back deserts into arable land. We have pursued the objective that ensures it contains effective and equitable funding provisions which maximise coordination of existing programs to combat desertification. The convention should also recognise the relationship between the desertification convention and other international environmental agreements, ensuring consistency between them all, and maximise possible commercial opportunities for Australian expertise in arid land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were the objectives that arose from our community consultation which we proceeded to the international negotiating table with. Who did we go to that negotiating table with? Did we go on our own as a government? Or did we bring community representatives? We brought community representatives to the negotiating table so that it was not just the government negotiating but it was the government and the Australian community organisations negotiating together. We brought the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, and they participated in the negotiations with us as a government; they participated actively as members of our delegation and in the international negotiating sessions. Did the government of Australia go as the government of Australia without recognition of the role of the states or the territories in Australia? No, it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Australia consulted closely with the states and territories. The states and territories, I might say, have played a significant role in the development of the policy positions that have been put forward. Their input led to the provision in the final text that the preparation of national action plans to combat desertification should be voluntary for developed country signatories&mdash;an issue that Australia pursued in these international talks&mdash;and the state of New South Wales represented the states and territories of Australia on the Australian delegation at all but the first of the five international negotiating sessions. </PARA>

The national rangelands management strategy will seek to provide management guidelines, scientific advice and recommend an ongoing consultation process relating to land use in Australia's rangelands while taking into account the economic and social implications. That is one major work on foot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs is currently inquiring into the landcare policies and programs in Australia, reporting on the last sitting day in December this year. It is a significant policy under scrutiny and it is subject to report later this year. The same committee is also inquiring into the rural adjustment scheme, reporting in December, and the value adding in agricultural production reporting in June of next year. That committee has a full workload and is doing significant things in those areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the decade of landcare, currently being undertaken under the auspices of the National Landcare Advisory Committee, will look at the operations and appropriateness of landcare programs. How they operate in the rangelands will be a key issue to be considered in formulating the national rangelands management strategy. There are a number of inquiries, in principle, currently being undertaken. The findings of those inquiries will make up what the government decides will be its most appropriate approach in implementing these reports. I do not think anyone can seriously argue that the government should pre-empt these inquiries and declare an implementation program instantly to satisfy and gratify some of the members of this Senate who ask what it should be. I think it is entirely appropriate that those inquiries go through, be completed and that the findings be publicly aired and contested. The government should draw from them in formulating its implementation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the issues raised in this motion are in the process of being addressed to the satisfaction of the majority of the interests that are involved; that is, through the consultative process, which surrounded the effective preparation of Australia's negotiating position on the convention. It is a position which is reflected in the final text and through the ongoing processes I have outlined in which government scientists, experts and land users are working together to find solutions to the environmental, economic and social difficulties which our arid environment presents us with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there is nothing that is happening here which can be stalled by allegations that we are undemocratic. That is nonsense. We are acting perfectly and responsibly within the constitution, as everyone knows. If we were not, there would be a challenge to us and we would be struck down and so we should. There is no challenge. We are not struck down. We are acting with authority, and we should proceed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the issue on which we are proceeding? It is the fact that this globe's land mass is turning to desert and requires concerted international action by all countries in the world to remedy it. It is an overwhelming international environmental issue. It is supported by all colours and stripes of government and political opinion as a major international problem. Australia in those circumstances has an obligation as a leading and developed nation in the world to play its role with the United Nations under this convention to attack that problem. That is all that this government wants to do: stand up for this country, play its international role properly and ensure that a serious environmental problem is properly dealt with. </PARA>

But the interesting thing is that this parliament will not get the right to say yes or no because this arrogant minister and this arrogant government have taken it upon themselves to decide what is good for this country and what is not, without any reference to the parliament and without any reference to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the parliament is to keep an eye on the ministry.

That is the argument that the government puts up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But he has clearly misrepresented the constitution and the constitutional law. The constitutional law is very clear on this matter. It was considered in a case called The Parlement Belge, and it was held that there was no unfettered power in the executive to execute treaties. In particular, the court in that case&mdash;and it has been upheld on numerous occasions since&mdash;ruled that, where the executive signs a treaty which could have implications for the property rights of private individuals, the effects of that treaty are a nullity because the execution of the treaty is ultra vires. Senator Cook clearly either does not understand that or does not wish to understand it, and that is the problem that this parliament faces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen from this government is nothing but obfuscation on the entire issue of its constitutional power and nothing but obfuscation on what is really behind this convention. For example, Senator Cook told this Senate just a couple of minutes ago that there had been a widespread process of consultation. That widespread process of consultation did not go so far as the tabling of this convention in this parliament. So much for the process of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament is the forum to which this government must bring its ideas and its proposals. This parliament is the body with which the executive must consult. Has it consulted with the parliament? The answer is clearly no. It has not even had the decency to table the convention. So how can it say there has been widespread consultation? Nothing could be more offensive to the truth than to suggest that there has been widespread consultation, whereas, in fact, there has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has this government done? This government has rushed off overseas with the idea of signing yet another convention. What is really behind this convention? Is it a concern for countries in Africa that are suffering from desertification? Or is it that this federal government wants to grab the land management powers off the states and grab powers off local authorities to manage their own shires? This is what it is really about, because Senator Cook gave the game away. Senator Cook said, in relation to the national action plans that are called for under the convention, that they were voluntary on affected developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is true; they are voluntary. But once the government lodges a national action plan, it is bound by that plan. So, yes, the plan is voluntary, but once it is lodged it becomes binding. It is merely the lodgment of the plan that is voluntary and not the undertaking to follow that plan. As soon as this government lodges a national action plan it will say to the states and local authorities, `I am sorry, we now have the power as a result of this treaty to handle land management issues in the states.' The idea that a couple of bureaucrats sitting here in Canberra can tell a local authority how it should manage its shire is quite simply preposterous. There are over 300 local authorities in my state of Queensland alone. Goodness knows how many hundred local authorities there are in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, and all these affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the federal government's real agenda is&mdash;it is all about power. It is not really about the environment. It was made clearer what the government's agenda was when Senator Cook said that the rangelands management strategy was part of the process of implementation. `Implementation' is the appropriate word, because the government intends to implement against the wishes of the states and against the wishes of local communities some sort of plan which was drawn up by UN bureaucrats. It is really offensive to me and offensive to many people in rural Australia that the Europeans, who have done a wonderful job of destroying their environment, will now get a say in how we run ours. That is a marvellous suggestion from the government, and that is where it is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very disturbing things about this whole process is the manner in which people seem to suggest that there is massive desertification in Australia at the moment. It is a fact that, drought notwithstanding, there is more water in some areas of western Queensland than there was 100 years ago, and there is a reason for that. Senator Crowley laughs because she obviously does not understand the issue and does not understand that it was only 100 years ago that people started putting bores in western Queensland and started to put water into areas which were previously dry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley represents that very narrow view of a small group of intellectual people who sit in Adelaide, who never get off the bitumen, who would not have a clue about Queensland, who would not have an understanding of the issues in question, and that is the danger in signing this convention. The best people to manage land management issues in Queensland are people who live there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that it is not necessary for us to sign this convention as it is. It is very clear also that we have other rights available to us&mdash;for example, the right to sign the convention with a reservation. Of course, if one listened to Senator Cook, one would believe that all the countries which have negotiated this convention will sign without reservation. Of course, this is a myth which the government puts around on a whole host of conventions but it is clearly not the case. For example, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights is signed with reservation by large numbers of countries. Yet this is part of the myth that the Labor Party wants to perpetuate&mdash;that everybody is going off on this utopian global action thing. The fact is that we will probably be one of the few countries which signs without reservation and without any consultation with the parliament. That is how arrogant this government has become. So it is clear that this convention does need parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question is: what is the best way in which to scrutinise this convention? Do we go down the route that Senator Coulter is proposing? We in the coalition disagree because we believe the better forum for this matter is the rural and regional affairs committee. I am very concerned about the terms of reference that Senator Coulter has provided because they give absolutely no scope for the committee which he proposes should examine the matter having a chance to look at the issues for local authorities, to look at the issues for land management and to look at the constitutional powers of the states and the rights of local communities to determine what happens in their own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, Senator Coulter's terms of reference in his motion seem more aimed, in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), at establishing a massive pattern of desertification in this country so that this country's land management can be further handed over to the scientific bureaucrats. For example, paragraph (a) states that the committee should examine&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the extent of desertification in Australia's rangelands, its causes and environmental, social and economic impacts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) actions required to halt and reverse desertification in Australia;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the capacity of the desertification convention to contribute to Australia's efforts to halt and reverse desertification, both in Australia and overseas;</PARA>
<PARA>The terms of reference do not mention looking at the competency of the federal government to legislate with respect to these matters, and that is of concern to us. We on this side of the parliament do not believe in giving a blank cheque to the government. That is what the first part of this debate is about. The second part of this debate relates to who should examine these issues&mdash;who is best qualified to examine these issues. We clearly believe that these terms of reference miss the main point of the objections that people in rural Australia have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing is that there is so much that can be done to make inland Australia more productive. One of the sad things is that if this sort of motion goes through and if this convention is signed without reservation we may lose the opportunity to deal with those problems, because the best way of dealing with problems of desertification and so on is through water storage, water conservation and irrigation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that these terms of reference do not examine that at all. They do not give the scope to do that. They do not focus on the bigger issue, which is how to make inland Australia more productive, because there is nothing wrong with the soil in most of inland Australia, it is just that it does not rain. If we can get more water to these areas, we can really make the country productive and we can improve the capacity to care for the soil, certainly in western Queensland, which I know very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, if we limit all our efforts to halting desertification, if it exists, we really miss the point of how we are to make Australia more productive. For those reasons, we on this side of the chamber cannot accept Senator Coulter's motion. We do not believe it offers anything to people in the bush; we do not believe it offers anything in terms of a grand vision for the productivity of this country. Therefore, we will oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly today in support of the motion from Senator Coulter. People would realise that I was involved in the debate some weeks ago on the motion by Senator Chapman to refer to a committee a reference on the desertification treaty. I find it a bit rich that Senator Chapman has suggested today that the Greens and the Australian Democrats, especially the Greens, were not prepared to look at a balanced inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we did at that time was to talk in detail to members of the opposition about such wording as is included in today's motion being included in the reference which they were proposing to put to a committee&mdash;that is, a truly balanced proposition, not just treaty bashing&mdash;and about their being prepared to put their information where their mouths were&mdash;and not just in relation to the environment. I wonder about their ability to read in some instances because part (a) clearly says that the proposal includes the `social and economic impacts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call always seems to be one way when the environment is concerned. When someone suggests taking action on the environment, the call is, `But this will cost money.' It may well do; but I do not know whether the opposition is aware that the federal government does not have any department whose job is to look at the social and economic implications of government decisions. In Western Australia the current state government has abolished the social impact unit and our federal government has put no resources into looking at the social and economic implications of any policy decisions, especially environmental ones. So what is being asked for is not being done officially, to my knowledge, by any other committee or unit in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, there is a national rangelands management strategy being developed. No, it will not have any requirements for people to do anything in particular, other than what is happening now. The rural and regional affairs committee is looking at a landcare study, but it is not specifically looking at economic and social implications. Senator Cook says it takes into account the economic and social implications. Who is providing that information on economic and social implications? Again and again we see that both major parties in this chamber separate out the environment from the economy, except when it is convenient not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there are economic implications of our turning a blind eye to the damage we are doing to the environment, we are not giving ourselves the ability to find out what those implications are. If it is true that irrigation in Queensland, as has been mentioned by Senator O'Chee, has reduced desertification there, that information is also the kind of information this proposal is looking at in terms of actions required to halt and reverse desertification in Australia. It does not mean that that information is not taken into account. But at some stage in this parliament, we have to work out whether or not we want to know not just about the environment but about the social and economic implications of decisions which impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, I have seen no evidence that either side wants to know. They perhaps want to make cheap points; but they do not want to know. Therefore, when we see that both the impact of desertification and the impact of the desertification treaty are mentioned in this motion, I find it extraordinary that the government does not want to know either. It cannot tell me which people are paid by the federal government to look into these kinds of implications and tell us what the implications are&mdash;because they do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we are prepared to support this motion. I also reiterate that we were prepared to support a sensible, properly balanced motion from the opposition which was not forthcoming. I am extremely disappointed that the government is prepared to allow this point scoring to continue. If we do not at some stage look at the way that we can integrate environment, economic and social issues, we will continue to have these arguments on every single occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested to hear Senator O'Chee talk about the right of parliament. He was painting for me a picture of an all-powerful organisation that really does not have to take into consideration a wide variety of views on issues that are dealt with by parliament. But might I just say that much of the legislation that goes through both chambers has been as a result of interest groups lobbying the government, asking it to put in place legislation which will assist them in furthering the interests of their industry and the people associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee talked about the validity of a treaty affecting private property. It must be very clear to anybody who thinks about these matters that any law or any treaty of any consequence which has been signed by a number of people will almost automatically affect private property. It is a question of dealing with that in a very thoughtful and considerate way and making sure that people are not disadvantaged. But surely the public interest on many occasions has to override the interests of individual people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations is, in my view, much more important to this globe of ours and to the future of young people in it than Australia or any other nation. Any nation is capable of being wiped out in the event of war. I believe that the United Nations, while it is imperfect, has played a great role in preventing any wars of any great significance, even though it has had to deal with many of the regional conflicts that now exist, and is the only organisation capable of really solving these problems and restoring peace in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the way in which the United Nations deals with developing protocols or conventions and the role of nations within that concept, one is reminded of all sorts of negotiations that go on in various areas of interest. The suggestion is that representatives of this country should go to the United Nations, sit down with representatives of numerous other nations to try to get some sort of compromise or consensus on what should be applied on a worldwide basis in the interests of all nations, and say, `Look, this is the position. We would be prepared to go so far on this issue, if you will come so far on the other issue.' But then all those representatives have to go back to their individual governments and ask, `What do you think of this document?' Those representatives would be sent back to negotiate again and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in many negotiations in the industrial relations field. Might I say that the key to the success of most of the negotiations is that the people involved in them had the authority to say, `Yes, our country will accept that. That is the view of our country.' It is not done in isolation; it is done because the people who are there should understand what the policy and position of Australia is in all of these negotiations. Senator Cook has already indicated that there was an involvement in the negotiations on the desertification convention. He mentioned the fact that the New South Wales government was represented by the district lands commissioner representing the north-western New South Wales districts, an area of rangeland that could well be, and has been already to some extent, affected by desertification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where we are going forward with people who understand the issues, drawing into the process people in the community. To me, that is democracy. These people understand the issues and are able to put forward a view, having in mind the general position in Australia. In relation to this convention, those people went into those negotiations with a knowledge of the development of what is known as the decade in landcare. Our landcare policy was put in place as a result of a lot of work done by the conservation movement and by the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say in this chamber that, as the chairman of the inquiry into landcare, the two people we first interviewed as witnesses were representatives of the Conservation Foundation, which at the time was one of the generators of the idea of landcare, and Rick Farley, who is the Chief Executive of the National Farmers Federation. One might think that there would have been differences in that area, but we found that most of the goals they had set were pretty much the same. There were some differences in some areas as to how we should reach those goals, but each of them wanted sustainable use of the land and the land preserved for future generations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found that landcare is operating reasonably well, based on evidence in various public hearings. How can we say, `We think landcare is a great idea; we have to preserve the land' and then look internationally at a proposal to do something about desertification? Of course it is a big concern for landcare. Senator O'Chee talked about irrigation, water points and the preservation of water. The facts are that in most cases desertification is caused by grazing cloven-footed animals on areas which cannot sustain them. They destroy the land cover and all the vegetation. Gradually the sand takes over and the desert encroaches on land that was once used by kangaroos and other soft-footed animals. So this raises the question of the use of the land and the number of beasts we might have on that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to that conference at the United Nations with this fairly long history of landcare and our concern for the land in Australia. No doubt there would have been views of a fairly conservative nature expressed as to what should be put in writing and accepted by the international community. I imagine that others who are fairly gung-ho would have suggested views and clauses in the agreement that would have created a situation where the land could not be grazed or used at all. We have a situation that is different from that of a compromise by the groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on the other side of the chamber are concerned, as Senator O'Chee is, about the government having the scrutiny of this convention. One would think there was something terrible about that, and that it was going to endanger everybody. For instance, Senator O'Chee talked about the right of local government to decide what should happen in its area. The facts are that local government boundaries and state boundaries in this nation are nothing but a hindrance when it comes to landcare. One of the largest landcare projects, and an area where probably more degradation has occurred than anywhere else, is the Murray-Darling area. There is a body that looks at the Murray-Darling area right across state boundaries, let alone local government boundaries. Landcare issues cannot be solved on a state-by-state basis; they have to be solved over the whole catchment area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our inquiry, by having discussions, listening to witnesses and travelling throughout Australia, we gauged very clearly, very easily and very early that the most successful landcare programs to bring the land back to its health and to look after the land in the future were based on catchment area plans and cooperation between farmers in a catchment area, even if it is only a small creek in a catchment area. For instance, we were told of the silly idea that had been in vogue over many years that if land was being cut up for ownership by farmers, whether it be under leasehold or freehold, it was done in squares. But in fact, for somebody to look after that land, it is more obvious and more correct to, say, run a fence along a ridge line so that the person in that area could more effectively look after the land without having to ask the person next door, or encroach onto that person's private property or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is being overcome by the idea of the catchment approach to management. Sensibly, many of the farmers are looking at how they work and are operating together. It is no good looking after the area down at the bottom of the catchment if the area above is creating problems. We went over with all this knowledge and we put our footprint on the international convention. We have used our skill and our credibility in these international forums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the provisions in the convention. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. National action programs shall specify the respective roles of government, local communities and land users and the resources available and needed. They shall, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) incorporate long-term strategies to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought, emphasize implementation and be integrated with national policies for sustainable development;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) allow for modifications to be made in response to changing circumstances and be sufficiently flexible at the local level to cope with difficult socio-economic, biological and geo-physical conditions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) give particular attention to the implementation of preventive measures for lands that are not yet degraded or which are only slightly degraded;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) enhance national climatological, meteorological and hydrological capabilities and the means to provide for drought early warning;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) promote policies and strengthen institutional frameworks which develop cooperation and coordination, in a spirit of partnership, between the donor community, governments at all levels, local populations and community groups, and facilitate access by local populations to appropriate information and technology;</PARA>
<PARA>So far I do not see anything to be concerned about and that should take up the time of the Senate. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) provide for effective participation at the local, national and regional levels of non-governmental organisations and local populations, both women and men, particularly resource users, including farmers and pastoralists and their representative organisations, in policy planning, decision-making, and implementation and review of national action programs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) require regular review of, and progress reports on, their implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>That fits in with some of the things suggested by Senator O'Chee regarding the involvement of local government. However, this convention says that no parliament should be given dictatorial authority to make these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Democracy is not about electing people for three or four years and then letting them do what they like; it is about people all across Australia in all walks of life being involved to make sure that those elected do the job properly and in the interests of the community as much as possible. As we know, there are conflicts and different points of interest. To return to the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Landcare has also found its way through a process of cross fertilization of international processes into other UN plans and strategies. The essential elements of the Landcare partnership concept was imported from the Desertification Convention to the program of action for sustainable development of small island developing states which was adopted in Barbados in May this year.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a situation where we develop a correct concept and attitude based on inputs from people in all areas of life in Australia because land care also talks about parks and gardens and areas around the urban parts of Australia. We have influenced people all over the world as to the correct approach to these things; yet we have people opposite suggesting that it is a matter where we are being dictated to by others in the United Nations. That is absolutely untrue. We have a great deal of influence and will continue to exert that influence for as long as our credibility lasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That credibility requires that we not only make these suggestions and have input into these conventions but also sign them and carry them out ourselves. A classic example of why we should ignore state and local government boundaries is a recent development where a number of people have got together in the mallee area of south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales. The land there, which is used for grazing, is very similar on either side of the state border. The people there are developing a system and a plan which will ignore that state boundary but will be good for the people who live there&mdash;people who are really Australians first, people who are making an input to the plan and who will have ownership of the plan. If that experiment can be used and translated into the international field, as far as I am concerned it is a great idea, and any convention that might cover that area should be signed by this particular nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hypocrisy has been shown on the other side in regard to this motion. I opposed the motion put forward by the opposition recently to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs because I think the convention is correct and the government has behaved in a correct manner. I oppose today's motion for the same reasons: I think it is a great convention and we should sign it. We should be proud of the input that we have had to it and we should be determined to give the same sort of input to other issues that will benefit everybody on this globe of ours so that we can create the circumstances where we can have a peaceful globe and a peaceful future for the children of every country in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I was really surprised at what Senator O'Chee had to say because he devoted at least half of his speech to really supporting the notion that these conventions should come in some form back towards this parliament; in fact, I think he was most eloquent in that respect. He then went on and quite inconsistently said, `but bringing it before this parliament by way of bringing it before a committee did not fulfil that requirement'. I am not too sure but unless he actually wants to&mdash;and I suspect that is the position of the opposition&mdash;actually get rid of this convention altogether and do nothing about desertification, the opposition is just simply using this process as an excuse to get rid of the convention and to get rid of an attack on desertification. And that is supported because going back to Senator Chapman's original address when he was moving his own motion, he spent most of his time arguing that desertification did not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, putting those things together, one finds the inconsistency in Senator O'Chee's argument and the lack of acceptance of this motion, which speaks specifically of the impact of the desertification convention on the sustainability of rural, pastoral, mining, economic, social and environmental communities and so on. It picks up the concerns which he has, genuinely, but does not go down the track of arguing that desertification does not exist. One is therefore unable to accept that inconsistency from the opposition. Again, I would enjoin the opposition to come in behind this motion and support it on the grounds that it is a mechanism by which not conventions in general but this particular convention can come before some parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook seemed to argue that, because there had been consultation&mdash;and he specifically mentioned the ACF, the farmers union and the government of the state of New South Wales&mdash;in framing the convention, therefore, it was fully democratic. I am a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation; it is a democratic organisation but democratic within the bounds of those people who join the organisation. It is not broadly representative of all the people of Australia, as is this parliament. Similarly, the farmers democratically elect the National Farmers Federation and it is representative, democratically, of farmers; but, again, it is not broadly representative of all the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is concerned about democratic representation, the appropriate institution to review this convention and conventions in general is clearly the parliament. When one looks at the House of Representatives, one finds that that is a very unrepresentative organisation in which the government has the numbers. Simply bringing the terms of the convention before the House of Representatives would result in the government guillotining them without any further consideration. It is in this House, where no party has the numbers to do that, in which bills, legislation and conventions are properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, Senator Cook argued that it is dangerous to bring these matters before the Senate because the Senate might water down the requirement. He conceded that the Democrats and the Greens would be seeking a strengthening of measures dealing with desertification. Our collective wisdom may improve the terms of the convention in relation to management of desertification in Australia. Horror of horrors, wouldn't it be terrible if we improved the way in which we managed our environment with respect to this very important matter!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook went on to say, `Yes, but we have 112 nations dealing with this matter, and 112 nations will come up with different results.' How inconsistent of this government simply to hand away its powers in relation to the environment by way of an intergovernmental agreement. Under this intergovernmental agreement, the government has handed to the arguments going on among nine governments the ability to undermine proper environmental concerns, the setting of proper standards for water, air, chemical exposure and a whole range of environmental issues. The government then came in here and said that, in relation to this international convention, it is not appropriate for this parliament to have a voice. The government does not have a logical leg to stand on with respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government wants unilaterally to sign these conventions, it should take up the powers&mdash;which it undoubtedly has under the constitution, and which are probably clearer with respect to environmental protection than in relation to international agreements&mdash;and it should appropriately legislate, but it does not do that. It wants two bob each way. It wants to argue one way with respect to international agreements and argue in a quite different direction when it comes to Australia's environmental protection under the so-called intergovernmental agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion does what we believe is appropriate. It brings before the parliament the terms of the desertification convention as they will impact on Australia and elsewhere in the world&mdash;and it specifically mentions that. As world citizens&mdash;and I was pleased to hear Senator Cook at least pick up that part&mdash;we have a responsibility. Primarily, this convention is to do with those other countries to which Australia will give aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 112 nations that came together were essentially represented by bureaucracies. They were not represented by the elected representatives of the people. That is the way these international conventions inevitably must be initially formulated. One can have no argument with that. It would be quite impossible to do it otherwise. It is appropriate that these international treaties and conventions come before the parliament. Contrary to what was said that this would necessarily lead to a weakening of these conventions and treaties, it may lead to a strengthening of them in which the treaty undertakings become the minimum requirement on countries. Each country can then legislate and move to impose stronger protective measures, in this case in relation to desertification in the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I would strongly enjoin the opposition in particular to support this motion because it picks up the point on which Senator O'Chee spent most of his time. It also brings back before the parliament the essential elements that were of concern to Senator Chapman. He was quite correct in commenting that it places emphasis on the environmental aspects of desertification, but I would have to disagree totally with his argument that desertification does not exist. I believe that the several scientists to whom he referred were right out of step with the many other scientists who have commented very extensively on this issue. I therefore strongly commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his remarks closing the debate on the proposed reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts a few moments ago, Senator Coulter claimed that, in my moving of a motion for a reference of the convention on desertification to an alternative committee a couple of weeks ago, I had said that there was no problem of desertification. I simply point out that that is not the case. What I did say on that occasion was that the United Nations bureaucracy had overstated the extent of this problem and, indeed, reputable scientists disagreed on the extent of the problem with regard to desertification. I also said in that context that reputable scientists disagreed as to the causes of the problem of desertification.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Former Labor Deputy Premier Parker was gaoled for taking money from his electorate campaign fund and using it for private purposes. How does that differ from Labor Party officials taking money from the central campaign fund and using it to pay off candidates' gambling debts and to provide holidays for candidates' families? Is not such a payment a gross breach of trust to party donors who believe their contributions will go to legitimate campaign needs? Would not such conduct demonstrate a seriously deficient sense of public morality on the part of such Labor Party officials?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a start, the matters to which Senator Hill is referring obviously have to do with state candidates and state elections and nothing to do with the operation of Commonwealth elections or Commonwealth electoral law. Even if the funding in question that is referred to had related to a Commonwealth election, it would not have had to be disclosed under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act as they stood at the time of Premier Burke's administration. It was not until 1992 that the act was amended to require third parties to disclose gifts made to candidates or parties, which would clearly have brought this sort of situation to light earlier on had that been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further point to be made about the particular case, however, of Mr Smith is that circumstances, as I am aware of them or as I have been advised of them, are manifestly very different in the sense that the transaction between the party and the candidate was completely open and straightforward, at least as between them. It did involve proper documentation and it did involve a very firm commitment for the funds in question being repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the agreement was to ensure that a candidate who was in deep financial trouble did not have to resign his parliamentary seat. The money was advanced to him to resolve his pressing financial problem. There was a written agreement that he would repay the loan at commercial interest plus one per cent when he could or, at the latest, upon his retirement on the receipt of his considerable superannuation payout. It was authorised by the appropriate party officers. The transaction was one, under the circumstances, as I am advised, which manifestly did not operate as a disbenefit to the party, nor could it have operated as a disbenefit to any donor to the party from which the money was derived, because obviously it was to be repaid, and on a commercially appropriate basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have to say any of that because it is all to do with state politics and all to do with state electoral law and state party administration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. What we are seeking to explore are the moral standards of Labor Party officials and where this federal Labor Party government stands in relation to those issues. It has nothing to do with Mr Smith because Senator Chris Evans last night told us that Senator Beahan's comments did not relate to Mr Smith. What we are talking about are statements that campaign funds will be used to pay off candidates' gambling debts&mdash;not a loan&mdash;and for holidays of candidates' families. What I asked the minister was: if money is expended in that way, is it not a gross breach of trust to the party donors who expected the money to be used for legitimate campaign ends; and would not such conduct demonstrate a seriously deficient sense of public morality on the part of the Labor Party official concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. What will be the role of Social Security in the provision of new assistance measures for farming families affected by severe drought? How soon can families expect to receive this assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1210" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I particularly appreciate being asked this question. It is also very appropriate that it comes from Senator West, whose commitment to people in rural Australia is very well known. Under this initiative, families affected by exceptional drought will be eligible for new drought relief payments. The payments will be equivalent to jobsearch allowance with an automatic flow-on to eligibility for family payments. Austudy will also be extended. It means that a family with two children aged between 13 and 15 will be able to receive about $380 per week. This payment will not be subject to any assets test on the farm. The usual income test for jobsearch allowance and off-farm assets test will apply to ensure that the payment is directed to families in need. There will be no activity test on the payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Ferguson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Farmers will not have to put their properties on the market and they will not have to be rejected by commercial sources of finance. The payment will be available to farmers subject to the exceptional circumstances declaration by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and that definition of exceptional circumstances will apply uniformly across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first payment will be made on 10 October and it will be able to be backdated to 1 October this year. The payment will continue for six months after the cessation of this declaration. The payment is part of a comprehensive package of assistance measures announced yesterday. It is estimated that farm families will receive a total of about $48 million this financial year and a further $21 million next financial year. If the drought breaks in autumn, under the drought relief payment that should see the payment assessed at about $21 million for next year. But if the drought persists beyond that, then a further $58 million is expected to be spent next financial year. These figures could increase if there are further exceptional circumstances declarations. The payments will be legislateable and will be available for as long as necessary and in any future exceptional droughts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative represents a major commitment by the government and a recognition of the legitimacy of the farm sector's argument that a targeted welfare response is necessary. The response is highly targeted to those in need as a result of severe drought. I acknowledge that the good news was accepted very favourably by a number of the senators opposite who spoke during yesterday's adjournment debate. They very much appreciated this payment package&mdash;in particular, the recognition that payments to families are a critical part of the assistance. This is not just ignoring the plight of the people out there, it is recognising very much that payments targeted to those families will be a very significant contribution to assistance during these exceptionally hard times. The package builds on the government's commitment to supporting families in need, particularly during this international year of the family.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is directed to you. Last night Senator Chris Evans told the Senate that Mr David Smith was not the person referred to in your evidence at the Parker trial as the recipient of campaign funds for gambling debts. If this is true, who was the candidate that received campaign funds for personal purposes? How many other candidates benefited in a similar manner during your tenure as party secretary?

But whatever duties you performed or activities you had as state secretary in Western Australia eight or nine years ago have no relevance to question time and your role as President.

But the fact is that this question relates directly to evidence given by you when you were the holder of very high office.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The point of order raised by Senator Ray is, of course, correct. The other point I would like to make is that questions such as this and the answers that flow from such questions could well be sub judice since several other charges have been levelled against David Parker, the person to whom Senator Alston refers. Having said that, I welcome this opportunity to put the record straight on what I think has been some terrible misreporting of these events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did agree to give evidence at Mr Parker's trial. I gave evidence, firstly, as a character witness and, secondly, to comment in general terms on some of the problems faced by political parties in campaign fund raising. I was not asked about, nor did I comment on, any specific matters relating to Mr Parker's trial, nor was I aware, except through newspaper reports since that time, of the matters raised in that trial. In my comments on the use of campaign funds, I made two broad points. These points were consistent with the points I put to the royal commission prior to this. I made the point that the question of ownership of campaign funds has been a vexed and difficult one, since donations are frequently given to individuals rather than to the party and since the intention of the donor is frequently not known. I made the point also that the problem is experienced world wide, and I gave some examples of recent cases in America on this very thing. As I said, this was consistent with evidence I had previously given to the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the second point that in expending campaign funds it is recognised that a wide discretion exists. Campaign expenditures sometimes involve judgments about whether certain things which may not appear to be directly related to campaigning are legitimate campaign expenditures. I indicated in relation to this that campaign funds had been expended on tidying up the image of a candidate. I believe that that is a justified use of campaign funds. I indicated also under questioning that I had heard of a candidate who had had a gambling debt met by what I thought was a campaign fund but which later proved to be party funds in a properly arranged loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no time did I refer to specific matters relating to Mr Parker's trial. I also made it clear that funds under my direct control while I was state secretary from 1981 to 1987 were held under very tight control with complete probity and to strict accounting standards. All of those accounts have been examined by the royal commission and it has found nothing wrong with any of them&mdash;all of the accounts of the party over the period during which I was there. I have no reason to believe it has been any different since that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point that the instructions that were given regarding other funds, such as the leader's fund and local funds, were that they should be run with the same standards and that under no circumstances should favours be given in return for donations received. As a result of the royal commission, the party's procedures have been tightened up and codes of conduct have been adopted by all states and nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disclosure legislation introduced in this parliament in 1991 now applies to all donations, state and federal. It did not at that time. I have always been a strong advocate of disclosure and I have also been an advocate of public funding, which I think is the only answer to this sort of problem long term. I have made a private submission to the royal commission to this effect. I did not condone the misuse of some funds that were not under my control during my term of office. I was simply trying in my evidence to convey some of the complexities of political fundraising and the expenditure that arises from that.</PARA>

Mr President, do I understand it from your  remarks that when you went beyond giving character evidence for Mr Parker you were talking about party practices in such a way that you certainly did not dissociate yourself from them or disapprove of them? I therefore ask: on what basis do you say that it is a vexed question when funds are paid into a campaign account as opposed to a personal account? When you say that the intentions of donors are often not known, what attempts were made during your reign to ascertain the intention of donors before the moneys were given?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to take the Senate back to matters of national interest. This is profoundly in the interests of the nation and has the capacity to make a contribution to substantially improving the living standards of many people, many of whom the National Party purports to represent. I would have thought they would be interested and would not welcome attempted interjections, because they may wish to know about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a seminar of Cairns Group countries held in Washington on Tuesday this week. It was inaugurated during the meeting over which I presided in May, and was organised by the Australian Embassy in Washington. It was attended by ambassadors from the 14 Cairns Group countries. They came together for two reasons, the first of which&mdash;and that which I want to give most emphasis to today&mdash;was to continue the pressure for implementation of the Uruguay Round decisions, and the second of which was to maintain the pressure for agricultural trade reform which was initiated by the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major preoccupation of the seminar was getting the Uruguay Round ratified and implemented by the US Congress. I would have thought that all would share that priority. The Cairns Group ambassadors agreed to step up collective pressure on the United States administration and the Congress&mdash;the administration is trying to get the legislation through; it is Congress that is causing the difficulty&mdash;to pass the legislation in time to allow the agreement to enter into force on 1 January 1995, with the benefits starting to flow accordingly. This action will serve to reinforce the message which I reported to the Senate earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Washington representatives of the Cairns Group agreed to write a joint letter this week signed by all 14 ambassadors or their representatives to key congressional committee leaders. The message they will deliver is that it is critical that they pass their legislation so that the World Trade Organisation and the agreement it is designed to implement can commence on 1 January 1995; that the United States must faithfully honour the commitments it has made, particularly in relation to agriculture, in the Uruguay Round; and that it would be unacceptable for the United States to turn its export subsidy practices into general market expansion and trade development programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairns Group participants, of which Australia is one, are concerned that such proposals have been put forward in the context of the draft Uruguay Round legislation. In addition to that letter, the ambassadors have agreed to follow up by seeking appointments to ram home the message to key congressional leaders. I will be taking the opportunity to reinforce that message to the director-general of GATT, Peter Sutherland, when he visits Australia next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue before the seminar&mdash;it is more of a medium-term issue but relates to the same matter and is very important&mdash;is the early stage development of the 1995 US farm bill. The manner in which this bill evolves will be critical to all the Cairns Group participants and, in Australia, critical to Australian agricultural trade to the United States and as a model for what might happen in other important markets. It is of direct relevance to Australian agricultural exporters, particularly sugar, dairy and beef exporters. It is also significant in terms of its impact on the international agricultural market and export prices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. We welcome the extensive range of assistance measures announced yesterday for farmers in Queensland and New South Wales who are suffering from exceptional circumstances due to four years of drought. However, farmers in many other parts of Australia, particularly South Australia and Victoria, are also suffering from exceptional circumstances, caused not only by lack of rain but by years of other calamities such as mouse plagues, frosts and rain during harvests. We can add to that low commodity prices as well as high interest rates. I ask the minister whether there will be any additional assistance for farmers in other parts of Australia suffering from exceptional circumstances who have little or no income. In South Australia in particular we are watching pastures and crops die, and dams empty&mdash;indeed, just this week we saw tens of thousands of sheep being trucked off properties in the west. How long will these farmers have to wait for assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hope, and I think most of the major farm organisations would hope, that they would never qualify for this assistance. I hope that that does not happen. I have actually seen expressions used such as `select group' which, I must say, I was extremely disappointed to see. People are in this `select group' because they have, as Senator Lees has said quite correctly, been droughted now for four years on the trot. The significance is that these are not marginal lands I am talking about. These are areas that for years have been renowned as Australia's most arable lands. In the Darling Downs of Queensland farmers have now suffered their eighth or ninth successive crop loss. They have had no income at all for four years.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even if we put in a billion dollars, it would be inadequate. What farmers actually want is some good seasons and some decent rain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria do apply across Australia nationally and that is one of the most significant parts of the package announced yesterday. The whole point is, as I said yesterday, that if the drought does not break as is predicted by February or March next year, which could by then involve other areas of Australia, at that stage the whole country will be in diabolical trouble. There will be a major domestic crisis should we go past next autumn without any rain. We are all hopeful that the meteorology bureau will prove to be correct, as long away as that time is, and that rain will come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have convened a meeting for tomorrow of primary industry ministers. I had a meeting several weeks ago with the South Australian minister, Dale Baker, who approached me to ask whether the Commonwealth would give consideration to the rural adjustment scheme on a regional basis.

Is the minister saying that, because the farmers in South Australia have had no income for three years for other reasons, he does not consider that they are therefore suffering from exceptional circumstances? To give an example: in the Wudinna area it has been three years since there has been a profitable crop harvested. They trucked 26,000 sheep out of there on Tuesday alone. Just at the time wool prices are increasing, they have had to get rid of the sheep&mdash;the very things that may have indeed saved them on those properties. Is this one of those areas that the minister is suggesting farmers should be phased out of? If he is saying that some of these areas should have farming phased out, then perhaps we should tell the farmers about that. What specific plans does he have to assist these farmers in South Australia, most of whom have totally used up their RAS entitlements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of significant policy changes that were made in yesterday's drought package involved providing significant additional resources into RAS in order to get more farmers into it. I think that is the bottom line. They are brought in by the eligibility criteria. That is going to be done in exceptional circumstances. I might add, for Senator Boswell's benefit, that one of the major problems we have identified over the last six months in the scheme in terms of access is that there are about 10,000 to 12,000 farmers out of a total of 125,000 in Australia who are in this serious situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there are farmers in that group who will need access to rural adjustment assistance and who will now get it. Among the other identified problems raised with us was the restriction on the actual limits of the amount that could be borrowed. People who had borrowed to the limit and were still able, because of the very valuable nature of the basic asset, to borrow more could not do so because of the existing restriction on the caps. A major problem was that people who should have been getting 100 per cent subsidy&mdash;in other words, an interest free loan&mdash;were not getting it. One of the reasons for that, frankly, is that the scheme works in such a way that we fund the lion's share of it up to 50 per cent&mdash;90 per cent is provided by the Commonwealth&mdash;and over 50 per cent, not unreasonably, the states have to match us dollar for dollar. There has been some reluctance, and that is why I read out the statement from Premier Goss that I was delighted to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to indulge in any politicking on this because that is not how I handle it, but the facts were that, a couple of years ago when this happened, Queensland agreed to match us dollar for dollar. It was very aggravating for those farmers in northern New South Wales when farmers on the other side of the border were getting 100 per cent interest subsidies and they were not. We were putting our share in but the New South Wales government refused to match us dollar for dollar&mdash;there was plenty of rhetoric but no action. I hope that will change tomorrow at this meeting.</PARA>

So the caps have been raised on RAS to allow people to borrow more. More money has been put into exceptional circumstances to make it now a demand driven system rather than a cash limited system&mdash;a major breakthrough.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was about to say before Senator Kemp jumped up&mdash;or should I say the `jumped-up Senator Kemp'&mdash;with his unnecessary point of order, in this present year the Commonwealth government has provided in Victoria $296 million, which is the maintenance of funding in real terms. This contrasts with the Victorian government making a cut of $78 million in real terms in 1994-95. We have maintained our funding to schools in Victoria. The Victorian government has cut its funding by $78 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we acknowledge that we are not about to tell state governments how to run their school systems, but there are two points about the policy and practice which I think should be made. Firstly, this highlights the critical need for all systems to develop adequate methods of reporting the outcomes of schooling. Most states are investing considerable time and money working towards ways of assessing and reporting learning and management outcomes. Apparently Mr Hayward, the Victorian education minister, believes this type of approach is `a lot of rubbish'. Debate about education should be about the quality of outcomes, not about the input of resources alone. For the sake of this state's students, I hope the Victorian government will come to terms with this and will follow the example of other states in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is quite clear that the outcome reporting should not be reliant on simple basic skill testing. What children are able to achieve as a result of their schooling is dependent upon the interaction of parents, the principals in schools, the teachers, the resources and the students themselves. To reduce the outcomes of schooling to a pen and paper test undermines the quality of our schools. Using a year's basic skill test to generate invidious comparisons between schools is really an attack on the whole process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only reason I am aware of why there was not a full-scale Great Hall dinner for Prime Minister Goh was that a non-parliamentary sitting week was the only week in which he could be here and the government, I think rather responsibly, took the view that it would be inappropriate to spend the enormous amount of taxpayers' money in sending the usual invitations to members of parliament and others to come from all around the country.

If the rabble over there on the government benches would like to keep quiet they might actually find out that I knew about the lunch as well and was not intending to raise the matter to save them a little bit of embarrassment. Is the minister aware that there is a need for a certain sensitivity because when quite apparently different treatment is offered to two ministers within the space of a couple of weeks it reduces all the Prime Minister's rhetoric about becoming closer and more in tune with Asia to just so much puff? That is the concern that I have. I believe the government could have handled it much better. There was not even an invitation delivered to most members of parliament, and that is a matter of concern.

Goh Chok Tong is a man of the utmost distinction, the utmost character, and someone with whom the Prime Minister of Australia has a very close relationship indeed, both in policy terms and in personal terms. He is someone who has been a very strong supporter, and has acted jointly with us, in the initiatives for trade liberalisation and regional security and otherwise that we have been mounting around the region. I believe there are some relationships as close as our relationship with Singapore and our personal relationship at the prime ministerial level with Mr Goh Chok Tong, but there is no leader or no relationship in the region that I think is more close.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Lees this day, relating to the recently announced drought relief package.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) had to leave the chamber, but he did give me the courtesy of saying that he was sorry that he could not stay. I know that the minister and certainly all senators on this side would be well aware by now that the measures announced yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with regard to drought specifically exclude South Australia because that state is currently unable to declare drought in affected regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that in his approach to the problem of exceptional drought circumstances he was fulfilling his commitment not to leave behind farm families which were in distressed circumstances. I know that is what he said in his statement, but I am wondering how he can explain that statement to a large majority of South Australian farmers, particularly to those on the Eyre Peninsula and in the Murray Mallee, who are seriously drought affected and who will continue to suffer unless funds are provided urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats often feign some interest in rural affairs. I was interested to note that when Senator Lees asked this question she mentioned that truck loads of sheep had left Wudinna to be taken to the markets&mdash;some 26,000 having left the area. If the Democrats had their way, their policy at the last election being to add an extra 18c a litre to fuel, would those farmers have been able to afford to send those sheep to market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the problem is that drought cannot be declared in a regional affected area. Two weeks ago Senator Collins agreed to a request from the South Australian Minister for Primary Industries to accept scientifically based criteria for the declaration of drought within regions of that state. I understand that the scientifically based criteria were forwarded to our Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Prime Minister at lunchtime today. I understand that these criteria, once received, could be used to trigger regional drought declarations in South Australia. I know that a process does have to be gone through before that can happen, but I would hope that Senator Lees and the Democrats&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are regions affected in South Australia and this measure needs to be put in place so those regions&mdash;not the whole state&mdash;can be declared drought affected. I hope that Senator Lees and the Democrats will immediately support the actions of the South Australian Liberal government, and certainly support the actions of coalition senators in this place, when it comes to the time for this trigger to be put into place, because it is absolutely essential that people in South Australian regions be helped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the diversity of South Australia it is very rare for the whole of the state to be in a drought situation, but there are many large areas of South Australia that have been suffering adverse conditions for a number of years. On the northern Eyre Peninsula and in parts of the Murray Mallee there are people who will not get a crop this year. I will be going to visit that area next week. There need to be special circumstances for areas such as this&mdash;and they are very large areas and very large grain-producing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we seem to face is that the only way an area can be declared a drought area or the only way any assistance can be provided is for the Prime Minister to visit. It has taken months and months for the Prime Minister to be dragged into the areas of New South Wales and Queensland where the drought has been so severe for so long. I would have thought that, with all that has been said in this chamber and in the public arena regarding the drought in northern New South Wales and Queensland, a visit would have been paid to these areas by the Prime Minister far sooner than this. It does not seem to take much effort to get the Prime Minister to visit areas affected by bushfires or floods. We have a prolonged serious situation, and have had for a number of years, in many parts of South Australia as well as those areas in northern New South Wales and Queensland that have suffered so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that relief measures can be made available particularly to those farm families which are suffering so greatly in many parts of South Australia. I certainly urge the federal government to do what it has to do to act as quickly as possible now that these criteria have been forwarded to it, so that the current suffering of these people in such adverse conditions can be put right in the same way that many people in the rest of Australia have benefited from drought assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate too long. At about 20 minutes past seven this morning I was appalled to hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) on the Alan Jones breakfast program on 2UE take what was a blatant and cheap political shot by saying he hoped that coalition senators would not delay the passage through the Senate of the seven acts, I think it is, that require amendment to implement the drought package. I thought it was a very cheap shot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be on the program straight after Senator Collins explaining to Alan Jones and a not inconsiderable listening audience about the money that the government has wasted in its various failed business dealings through DAS.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the package that the government has brought down to assist the farmers suffering in the drought. But, while doing so, I question where exactly that assistance is to go. It seems to me that the problem is in how we define extreme drought. I know that the RAS has a way of describing or defining it, but I do not really know how many people have really understood it and worked out who is able to get the assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

When it comes to the families in that area putting bread on the table, they could be in exactly the same situation as people in New South Wales, Queensland and parts of Victoria. The government has to tell us what it is going to do for them. As I mentioned yesterday, the Esperance area, in the south-east region of Western Australia, is in a pretty bad way this year, even though it had a reasonable year last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely it does not stop at the border. Droughts do not follow borders. I welcome the measures in relation to social security because it gets to the core of the family. I also welcome the Austudy measures. There is quite a push to change the RAS guidelines to make finance more easily available. I caution the Senate on that because I saw the experiences in Western Australia of the 1976-77 droughts and the 1983 drought. The money got the farmers into more strife than it got them out of because it was too easily available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in the RAS system, as long as it is administered properly. I have always said that it was not administered properly in Western Australia for the reasons I have mentioned. There were deserving farmers who were going to be viable in the long run. They were not helped. There were others helped who were not going to be viable in the long run and the money helped those farmers to go over the line completely. The ones who battled for themselves got there in the long run and are solid now. So I caution the Senate on moving too far down that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look forward to when this drought is over. The government has to put measures in place to make sure that resources are built up and made available to farmers when this drought finishes because, as sure as we are on this Earth, there will be another drought somewhere at another time. We have to work towards that time by that conserving fodder and cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has mentioned in the release on drought that it is looking at an investment allowance for building  storage and extra dams for water. I do not think that will provide too much help to farmers who are coming out of the drought. For at least four or five years they will have low incomes. What is the point of allowing a further investment allowance if they do not have any income to pay tax on? So that allowance does not mean much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to look at putting back in place the sorts of IEDs we had under the Fraser government. They used to work all right. A massive amount was available and used, including during the 1982 drought in the east and the 1983 drought in the west. The IEDs become very useful. Unfortunately, Peter Walsh, a friend of mine who used to be on the other side of the chamber, reckoned that they were being rorted. I could not see where they were being rorted. The system was changed and the fund total dropped from about $300 million to about $50 million or $60 million. So the fund is useless as it stands and I ask the government to bring the total back to where it used to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join Senator Ferguson in expressing my great concern and disappointment that the drought relief package announced yesterday does not, as the situation currently stands in South Australia, apply to those farmers on the Eyre Peninsula and in the Murray Mallee of South Australia, who are suffering the devastating impact of drought at this stage of the season. The reason for that is that in South Australia there are no criteria whereby the concept of extreme drought can be determined to enable the relief package to apply to farmers in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blame for that lies fairly and squarely with the  Labor Party because for a decade in South Australia we had a Labor government that paid scant regard to the needs of the rural people of South Australia. That scant regard is no better demonstrated than by the fact that during that long period in office it failed to put in place appropriate criteria whereby extreme drought could have been recognised when it struck. So we now have a drought package, announced last night, that will not be applicable to those farmers in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his great credit, the Minister for Primary Industries in the new Liberal government in South Australia, Dale Baker, has been working assiduously to develop appropriate criteria which might be acceptable to and recognised by the federal government. He will be putting those propositions to the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, at a meeting tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal will be that there be specific scientifically based criteria whereupon South Australian farmers could trigger the exceptional drought circumstances and thereby benefit from the package that was announced last night. It remains for me, along with Senator Ferguson, to urge Senator Collins in the strongest possible terms to give very favourable consideration to the proposals that Dale Baker will be arguing before him tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless those criteria are accepted, South Australian farmers&mdash;who are suffering equally with farmers in other states from the devastating effects of drought this year&mdash;will be left high and dry. Contrary to the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he visited rural areas a couple of weeks ago, which claim he reaffirmed yesterday in announcing this drought package, the farmers in South Australia will be left behind unless these very worthwhile criteria which Dale Baker and his departmental officials have worked hard to develop are accepted&mdash;criteria which they have worked hard to develop in the face of years of neglect by the Labor government that was thrown out of office at the end of last year. They are viable criteria, and I can only urge Senator Collins to accept them, to ensure that South Australian farmers obtain this much needed relief. </PARA>

<PARA>It is a great disappointment to me that the minister's answer was so misunderstood by those opposite who have raised questions concerning private schools. The issue at the heart of this matter was the effect on the state education system in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is understood just how severe the changes to education have been in the state that I represent. I do not think it is understood what sort of impact the cuts and disruptions that have occurred in Victoria are having on Commonwealth education programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two years we have seen some 230 schools close&mdash;a very large number of schools. We have seen teaching numbers reduced by about 8,000&mdash;8,000 teachers taken out of the education system in one state. We have seen a decline of some 7,000 in the number of students attending school. We have seen cuts of $370 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that has a very dramatic impact on the quality of education outcomes in the school system. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the prime objective of its educational support programs is to supplement state school funding so as to provide equality of opportunity for students right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth currently provides nearly $300 million for education in Victoria. My grave concern is that, as we move increasingly to global budgets for individual schools at a state level and as we move towards greater devolution of educational authority in the states, we are likely to see the substitution of Commonwealth funds for state funds where cuts are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This model has an impact on the quality of services that are available for the education of students right across Australia. The issue that arises is whether or not state government attacks on education ultimately undermine the educational objectives of the Commonwealth government. That to me is a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, it will be seen as an extremely important matter for this whole country. In Australian education we are placing increasing emphasis on the development of skills necessary for a flexible and mature work force. One cannot have that while simultaneously undermining the very foundations of the education system in this country. The importance of this matter is that the model that is being expressed in Victoria is now being copied in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The Commonwealth spends nearly $3 billion a year on schools programs. If this sort of pattern of behaviour is allowed to continue where state governments undermine national programs, we will be entitled to ask whether or not very large sums of money are being put at risk through the service provided to young people in this country. Ultimately, such an attack on education will impact on the economy as a whole. So, for this reason, I am very concerned. </PARA>

<PARA>I find it very hard to believe that, as conscientious and as diligent a minister as Senator Gareth Evans is&mdash;and I mean that quite sincerely&mdash;in the discharge of his duty, he has not visited the major embassies many times in this capital city of Canberra. In fact, I would have thought he would have visited all embassies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, putting that aside, we have a grossly offensive sign about East Timor that has been across the road for quite a long while in front of the Indonesian Embassy. To argue that somehow or other the Indonesians have to put up with the most robust elements of Australian society and at the same time argue for the development of good Australian-Indonesian relations is to show that the minister knows nothing at all about Indonesia. The sensitivity, the obliqueness of dealing with the Javanese, the dominant culture in Indonesia, is as remote as possible from the bar room behaviour of parts of Australia. It requires tact, sensitivity and respect for their position, and this sign to them is grossly offensive. Furthermore, it does not reflect Australia's official foreign policy. Australia's foreign policy is to support or recognise the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern about it relates to the weaseling answer that the minister gave, saying in effect, `This is a democracy; you have to like it or lump it.' This is not a libertarian society&mdash;people do not have a licence to behave as they see fit. They certainly have a right to freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of speech. All of those things are not transgressed or denied, though, by good manners. We have here a permanent insult&mdash;not a transient one like a group meeting outside the gates of an embassy demonstrating a point of view. What we have here is deeply offensive to the Indonesians and it is deeply offensive to me as an Australian. Because we have emissaries in this country, the representatives of other powers, other nations, we have an obligation to treat them courteously, not discourteously in the way we are treating the Indonesians at the present time and have treated them for quite a long time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of my determination was that the matter raised by Senator Vanstone involved an allegation that the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, Mr Cleeland, had made unauthorised disclosures of the Committee's deliberations and false and misleading reports of the Committee's proceedings, and such an allegation could not be the subject of inquiry or action by the Senate, but could only be examined and dealt with by the House of Representatives. I drew attention to a very similar case in 1988 in which my predecessor made a similar determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Vanstone suggested that my determination involved a presumption that Mr Cleeland was responsible for the alleged unauthorised disclosure and false and misleading reports, whereas inquiries may reveal that Mr Cleeland was not responsible for the disclosures or the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I dealt with this point my initial statement, when I said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is clear that it is the chairman of the Committee, Mr Cleeland, who stands accused of making the unauthorised disclosures of Committee deliberations and of giving the false and misleading accounts of the Committee's proceedings.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is theoretically possible that the journalist concerned falsely claimed Mr Cleeland as his source, Senator Vanstone's letter makes it clear that this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the matter raised by Senator Vanstone involves an allegation against Mr Cleeland. The press reports referred to by Senator Vanstone quote Mr Cleeland as their source. Senator Vanstone's letter, which I tabled in the Senate, indicates that the Committee had already, as she put it, admonished Mr Cleeland in relation to the alleged unauthorised disclosures. In order to conduct an inquiry, the Privileges Committee would have to question the journalists concerned and Mr Cleeland as to whether Mr Cleeland was their source.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the Labor Party has got an intended quota system for female parliamentarians is a matter of great concern to the coalition. This will be the way in which its numbers are bolstered in the future, because it goes nowhere to removing the barriers which presently block or limit the entry of women into the parliament, and it may work to create reverse discrimination against male candidates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that over the past few months, while this system has been debated within the Labor Party, the figure started at 50 per cent, it was dropped to 40 per cent, it has now dropped to 35 per cent, and the Labor Party still cannot decide how it will deliver such a quota system by the year 2002. Originally, it was going to be brought forward even further than that. It is amazing that someone like Dr Lawrence can lower her ideals so much that she needs to indulge in tokenism and belittle the role that women can play within the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate does note the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue and the terms of the mismatch of rhetoric and record. While the party has been arguing about affirmative action since 1981, it has still not done anything whatsoever to improve the situation. This is the Labor Party that for some 13 years has been talking about affirmative action and, on its track record, it has gone in the opposite direction in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For example, the coalition government of New South Wales has three female ministers. Why does the Labor Party not take an example being set without quotas? Why does it not have more female ministers? Why does it not bring more female ministers into this federal parliament? Why does it not have more female ministers in the Queensland government? It is purely and simply because it needs to have the quotas to do it. It does not just do it on its own behalf; it has to have quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Western Australian Legislative Council, for example, the Labor Party had five female members; it now has two. It is going in the opposite direction. It had nine female members in the lower house; it now has five. What is the Labor Party talking about? At the same time that it is talking about quotas it is actually consistently dropping female representation. The Labor Party is clearly making no progress on the issue of women in parliament, either in Western Australia or in a number of other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party puts up women as lambs to the slaughter. We should look at what it did to Carmen Lawrence and Joan Kirner. While both of those women were participants in ministries, leading their respective states into the ground, their Labor Party decided that they had to be the sacrificial lambs and taken to slaughter. Both of them then had to lead unsuccessful governments to defeat. That is the track record of this Labor Party&mdash;it actually leads its women to slaughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the Labor Party's resolution on this quota system states that the national executive will have the responsibility and the power to determine the outcome in any public office preselection progressively between now and the year 2002 in order to ensure that the rule is complied with. That is what it has to do; it actually has to get intervention to make sure that the rule is complied with. But, of the several opportunities to get the ball rolling so far available to the Labor Party at the state and federal level, very few of them have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last Saturday week there was a by-election in the Western Australian state seat of Helena. Until that election was held, that was a Labor-held seat. But what did the Labor Party do? Instead of complying with its own so-called demands of quotas and getting in good women, it endorsed a man against the Liberal Party candidate, a very competent female who is now the member for Helena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this tokenism, all of this flapping of the jaws, is leading absolutely nowhere in the Labor Party. Senator Gareth Evans may well displace a female candidate in running for Holt. We can only wonder whether he is prepared to endorse a female to fill his vacancy here in the Senate. But the deal has been done for Senator Evans to go into Holt, giving no consideration whatsoever to a female taking that seat. Yet the Labor Party is still saying that it has to get more women into winnable seats. It just does not gel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the case of Jenny Beacham, the candidate for the marginal seat of Ballarat in Victoria. Ms Beacham is one of the Labor Party's highest profile and&mdash;as it tells us&mdash;most competent women, a former party state secretary. Why, if it thinks that much of her, did it endorse her for a marginal seat? Why has it not given her Holt? No, it gives her a marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the ALP's idea to endorse more women candidates only for marginal seats such as this, the policy can be little more than hot air at best and tokenism at worst. But that does not seem to worry the Labor Party. As Dr Lawrence has said, `I'm not into women coming up via male patronage.' I do not know what she is into but there is no way that this Labor Party is demonstrating what it is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan to introduce quotas may well and truly backfire by violating anti-discrimination guidelines and opening the floodgates to damages claims by unsuccessful male candidates. That remains to be tested but it is inevitable that it will be tested if a man is excluded from preselection by the Labor Party on the basis of his sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of legal opinions have been given to the effect that this government, this Labor Party, is actually contravening the anti-discrimination legislation which it brought into this country. I ask Senator Crowley when the government will be introducing legislation to make its decision on quotas retrospectively legal. Quite clearly, according to so many legal opinions, what it is doing is illegal. When will the government introduce such legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even allowing for the normal retirement rate of male politicians, there will not be enough seats available to come anywhere near the quota being demanded. Does that mean that men will simply be pushed onto the scrap heap? Certainly the men in the Labor Party in Western Australia are starting to dig in their heels because four of them have been earmarked for retirement and replacement. They are pretty cross about that. But does it matter to the Labor Party? No, it does not. Does it matter that it is contravening its own legislation? No, it does not. No wonder those people are pretty angry because the policy threatens to end the political careers of many good male politicians. But the Labor Party does not care about that because it is quite happy to indulge in reverse discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that this is just and wise. I wonder how the 60 male members of parliament who are going to be given the flick feel about that. I wonder whether they consider that it is just and wise. The policy is a classic bandaid measure. It is ill-conceived, it is clumsy and, above all, it is jolly patronising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Labor Party not recognise the achievements made thus far by women in parliament in the past and present? Does it think that without male intervention women will never get anywhere on their own in the future? The attitude is appalling. It is the most appalling indictment of the many notable achievements of women not just in the parliament but in sport, in the arts and other areas&mdash;professional women who, through their own blood, sweat and tears, have actually succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disturbed to learn that the other night Dr Lawrence made some inane quip on a program in which she and two other politicians&mdash;a British member of parliament and a Swedish member of parliament&mdash;were being interviewed. The British member of parliament said that the House of Commons is such a boys' club that it actually has a shooting gallery. Dr Lawrence said, `Oh, we have squash courts'&mdash;in other words, insinuating that women should not play squash. I wonder whether Dr Lawrence has ever heard of Heather McKay, Michelle Martin or Rachel Grinham, because they all happen to be Australians, they all happen to be champions, they all happen to be women, and they all happen to be squash players. But what does Dr Lawrence do? She belittles women again by saying that they are incapable of competing in sports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether Dr Lawrence would like to recall the good work that the Australian women did at the Commonwealth Games. But no, she belittles women because there somehow have to be quotas. These women achieved on their own behalf. They did not have to have quotas. They did not have to have some artificial crutch to get them there. But that is what Dr Lawrence is talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the progress made under the Liberal Party in comparison to the Labor Party. The Liberal Party has traditionally encouraged women to play an active role in many facets of our society, including the parliament, and under the Liberal Party women have been encouraged to make real achievements. It has never been the intention of the Liberal Party to implement a quota scheme whereby the numbers of women in parliament or the judiciary are artificially bolstered merely as an act of tokenism. The Liberal Party has the runs on the board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. Secondly, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 16 September 1944, Robert Menzies discovered he needed women. In securing support to create the Liberal Party he struck a deal with 40,000 members of the Women's National League in Victoria, assuring them that 50 per cent of executive positions at every level of the state Liberal Party would go to women in return for their support and finances. What does Senator Knowles call that? Is that not a quota? In fact, we know why he did that. He did it because the women held Robert Gordon Menzies to ransom by saying, `If you don't guarantee us 50 per cent of all executive places, you won't get the money that our large families can give you to establish this party.' That is what Senator Knowles's party is founded on&mdash;quotas for women to keep them in the backroom. The quotas for these women did not deliver them into parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

It would be hard to decide that because there are no guaranteed seats for men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if Senator Knowles understood the Sex Discrimination Act she would know that that is not possible. Political parties are exempt from the effect of that act. Senator Knowles does not even know the legislation that applies, and why would she? Eight of her colleagues crossed the floor to support the Sex Discrimination Act because her party was in such disarray about the act that her party actually opposed it. Those opposite thought it was going to wreck and ruin the world. But Senator Knowles does not understand it. No complaints can be brought: political parties are exempt from that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is important and interesting to note what happened to the people in the opposition who crossed the floor and supported the advancement of women. What happened to Mrs Kathy Martin? She was sent to an early political grave for wanting to support women. Senator Knowles could ask Peter Baume where his career went after he had the courage to support women. Senator Michael Baume would know that very well. She could also ask a number of other people in the opposition about what happened to their careers when they took the difficult step of crossing the floor to support the government's legislation on sex discrimination.

We are very serious about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take issue with another remarkable piece of nonsense that Senator Knowles referred to, that is, that women in the opposition get there on their merits and have never had the assistance of men, but that Labor Party women only get advanced because of the assistance of men. Actually, I have never felt that the assistance of men is an insult, particularly if it achieves things for candidates, and for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year in South Australia we are celebrating an extraordinary achievement in which men assisted. They had to. I am talking about the centenary of suffrage. The vote for women in South Australia, and the right to stand for parliament, was won 100 years ago. We were the first democracy in the world to give that advance to women. As the parliament of the time that was bound to change the law was made up entirely of men, what were women to do? They needed to accept the assistance of men to change the laws, of course. For Senator Knowles to claim anything contrary to that is sheer and utter nonsense. Women accepted the support of members of parliament, all of whom were men, who were prepared to see that the future for a real democracy would be based on having fair representation for women. Certainly at least they saw there should be the opportunity for women to have a say in the shaping and formulation of the laws of the land through electing the people that they preferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the Senate that Alexander Downer's grandfather at that time promised that he would support that legislation but, when it came time to vote, he did not do so. I am very pleased to remind Mr Alexander Downer of that at every opportunity. His grandfather said he would vote for women's suffrage but then did not. Senator Knowles might tell us what she has to say about that. Was Alexander Downer's grandfather for her or against her? Did he assist in progressing the advancement of women? Is Senator Knowles wanting to give away the right to vote that men won for her?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in Western Australia? Did women win the vote for themselves there, or did male parliamentarians win it for them? Senator Knowles has put a nonsense argument. Perhaps it is not clear to listeners why those opposite want to argue as they are doing. They are castigating the Labor Party for making moves towards a rule change in an attempt to make serious its intention of having a fair representation of women elected to parliament. I would have thought members of the Liberal Party should be in here celebrating that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no insult to women here. The women to be preselected, as is the case with the ones who have gone before, will be selected on merit, on their ability to perform as good candidates in the community in a House of Representatives seat or as an adequate and comprehensive person in the Senate. Different qualities may be needed. Women candidates have always been chosen on merit, and not because they are incompetent and men choose only incompetents. That is a pathetic and puerile argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand Senator Knowles's argument, except to say that apparently the Liberal Party thinks that women should be left to manage by themselves and not be given any assistance. This Labor Party and this government are absolutely committed to ensuring that our promises to women make a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are the first to come in here saying, `Why aren't there more women on boards? Why don't you do something about that?' We can only urge boards to further the appointment of women; we cannot force them. We are leaving it to boards to understand the changing society that we have. In one way those opposite want more women on boards. They either want them to achieve, or they do not. Senator Knowles cannot have it both ways. Is she not pleased about the success of the Labor Party in getting an increased number of women in parliament, or is it that she only wants Liberal women in parliament? If she only wants Liberal women in parliament, she should come out and say that only certain sorts of women are acceptable. Is it a disadvantage to have the Australian Democrats represented by men and women? If she is serious about more women in parliament, she should embrace all women in this parliament. But when it comes to the political crunch, then of course we are down to our usual party disciplinary lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Knowles is confused. She is not at all clear about what she is trying to say. She wants women in parliament, but she does not want to take steps to assist them. She is suggesting that a quota system does not guarantee merit, but she is absolutely wrong. She objects to quotas, but the Liberal Party was founded on quotas. I have to say to Senator Knowles that she should not come in here and point the finger at us.

The Liberal Party suffers from a paradox because, on the one hand, we have an historical willingness to incorporate women into internal party structures but, on the other hand, we have an ongoing failure to articulate policies which address discrimination against women.

I bet it does not. It will not work if it is not really about structural change; it will not work if it is about imposing quotas on a system which is not a good one in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have not had a need for quotas, mainly, I suggest, because of the importance of our participatory structures. This is something which is rarely acknowledged when people talk about the involvement of women in Australian politics. These are processes which have delivered the election of the first woman leader of a political party at a federal level in Janine Haines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the Democrats do not come with a lot of historical and political baggage, and we have not had to battle with the sorts of vested interests or entrenched male hierarchies which exist in other parties. But that is the very thing that appealed to me and to other women when I joined the Democrats. Right from the start, the male and female founding members set up our party processes along participatory principles, inclusive principles; that is something which many women find attractive. I am not revealing anything new when I say that participatory structures can be very difficult to work with at times, but I do think it is one argument that has to be acknowledged. It is one of the major reasons why women have done so well in the Democrats, compared with other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish by mentioning the matter of electoral reform. There is not much point in political parties running around sniping at each other about who does or does not care about getting more women into parliament if we do not address the fundamental question of major electoral reform. I think it is very clear that multi-member electorates are essential to achieving better representation for women, and I do not think we should be afraid to start looking at various ways of improving our electoral system to make it a more representative one. </PARA>

There has been a bit of opportunistic sniping about what the Labor Party or the Liberal Party might do, and I am going to avoid indulging in that level of debate. The issue is about women's equity in this country. It is about women taking their place in the democratic processes of the national and state parliaments and, indeed, at local government level as well. I do not think it really helps for us to say almost like schoolgirls, `We are better than you.' We are all in exactly the same boat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, a colleague who was battling to gain recognition in the business sector said to me, `He's your colleague, your equal, a post liberation new sensitive age guy. But compete with him and you'll find this new dog knows some very old tricks.' That quote refers to Liberals, to Democrats, to Labor men, to men in business and to men in the public sector. The women who have actually made it into parliament are all in the situation where we can start to raise these issues, to try to get greater public awareness of the issues and, in the case of the Australian Labor Party, I am proud to say, we are prepared to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could tell some horrendous stories about my party's record&mdash;and I see some of those opposite looking very interested&mdash;but I am not going to. I do not think that serves the debate for the future. What I can say, though, is that the Australian Labor Party next Tuesday, as a result of the rules debate that has been flagged by the decision of the national executive and led very ably and very strongly by Prime Minister Paul Keating, will reject the chauvinism of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will say, sure, we have not got it right in the past; far too many men have been promoted and merit has had nothing to do with it. Far too many women have been overlooked. Far too many women have been ignored. We confess that, but that is in the past. We are looking to the future. We are finding a new way, and that is the quota approach or the target approach, depending on one's preference of terminology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some people in this parliament and, indeed, in the community who seem to think that setting a particular target or quota is somehow revolutionary or radical. What will the Labor Party's decision, this rule change, mean next Tuesday? It will mean that one in three vacancies, as they occur, will be negotiated through the factional system so that one in three vacancies are filled by women. This process will proceed over the next eight years. That is not particularly revolutionary. If many of my women colleagues were asked how they would do it, they would have done it very differently; it might have been much more radical. This is a realistic, logical compromise; it is a sensible decision which I know will be endorsed by the national conference next week and I am proud to be associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent Inter-Parliamentary Union survey revealed that the proportion of women in the world's houses of parliament has dropped significantly in the last five years. This concept of setting a target or quota is not something particularly radical. Twenty-three countries with social democratic parties currently operate some form of quota system to ensure that more women are represented in parliament. Canada and Great Britain have adopted a 50 per cent quota for women by the year 2000. Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany have adopted a 40 per cent quota for each gender. Other countries, including Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Spain and Turkey, have each introduced quotas which range from 15 per cent to 33 per cent. Quite clearly, this is a way to start to bring about reform&mdash;reform that is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was minister with responsibility for the status of women, I used to wonder when the private sector directors would attack me for expecting them to comply with affirmative action legislation while within my own ranks we ignored such principles. The Labor Party has a very proud tradition in terms of our commitment to social justice, to recognition of equal opportunity, to recognition of equity. The only thing is that somebody forgot to tell us about it when we were working on the inside, when we were working on our home bases, if you like, within the party. Now is the time for us to change. That change has been announced through our national executive processes and it will be endorsed next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who say it cannot work, that we are going to force men out of parliament, I say: you would have to be joking! Do people really think that the handful of women who actually have any power or authority within this parliament are going to have the power and authority to march men out of the parliament by force? What nonsense! The 35 per cent target is a realistic and logical way to proceed. Women in the party will be monitoring it very closely. Women in the community will also be watching it very closely. If the 35 per cent target is not being met, if jobs for the boys are continuing to be delivered to the boys, if the mates and the favoured sons are being put first, it will be not only women in the party but women in the community who have something to say about it, because women expect more representation of women not only in parliament but at the upper levels of all decision making around this country. </PARA>

That is why I thought Senator Kernot's contribution in general was a very positive one. Her party probably needs quotas for men rather than women to create some kind of equality. But the key point is this: the Labor Party's hypocrisy in going down the track it has gone down&mdash;that is, having quotas&mdash;is aimed at covering up a deep-seated tradition which has been anti-women.

She is absolutely right. I quote her directly: it is without quotas in the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point referring to what Senator Crowley said; it was all so incredibly nonsensical.

If only her party would allow people to cross the floor, we may be able to see what some of them really think&mdash;if they think at all. Clearly, this is a matter largely of humbug.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has a well-established and very proud tradition in selecting and promoting women into politics&mdash;a fact that is all too often overlooked or deliberately ignored by those who are in the business of rewriting history, like the people opposite. The Liberals are extremely proud of the way this party has recognised over the last 50 years the enormous contribution that women from all walks of life can and do make to Australian public life and politics in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have had an important role to play in the Liberal Party since its inception. Our record is certainly much more impressive than Labor's. There is still a lot to be done, I concede, but I underline Senator Kernot's point: our record is better than Labor's. I guess Senator Kernot would probably say it is less worse; nonetheless, it is better&mdash;without quotas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Liberal Party has always promoted and encouraged women, Labor has only recently&mdash;and quite cynically&mdash;realised that women have an important role to play in the Australian political system. Let us recognise that the first woman elected to the New South Wales parliament&mdash;I speak strongly of New South Wales as a representative of that state&mdash;was Millicent Preston in 1925. She was a member of the Nationalist Party, which was a precursor of the Liberal Party that opposed the Labor Party in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the federal level, the Liberal Party was the first in appointing a woman to cabinet, in 1949&mdash;Dame Enid Lyons. The first woman to serve in a cabinet and have responsibility for a government department was Senator Margaret Guilfoyle in 1976. Naturally, she was a Liberal. In New South Wales, Rosemary Foot was the first woman to be elected to a senior leadership position. That happened 11 years ago when Mrs Foot was elected deputy leader of the parliamentary party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, there are four women in the New South Wales state cabinet. That is the highest proportion of women in any ministry in Australia. That is a proud record for the New South Wales Liberal and National parties. The New South Wales cabinet has twice as many women as does the state Labor Party's shadow ministry, which has only two females. If Bob Carr, the state leader of the opposition in New South Wales, and the ALP are serious about promoting women, the shadow ministry is not a bad place to start; unless, of course, Mr Carr thinks there are no women of merit on his back bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the only way for a woman in the Labor Party to be promoted up the ladder is for her to belong to the right faction and be married to one of the self-styled power brokers. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said only last week, the New South Wales Labor Party idea of affirmative action is `giving your wife a job'. Perhaps in view of the Cabramatta preselection going on at the moment, we should add `or your fiancee'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Labor Party is not being hypocritical it should replace with women those male Labor members who are poor performers in this parliament. I would rather see an incompetent male replaced by a female, even if she were equally incompetent. In particular, in the Macarthur electorate, Mr Chris Haviland, a particularly undistinguished member, should be replaced by his challenger&mdash;as yet unannounced&mdash;from his faction, Miss Meg Oates. I do not know when that is going to take place but I understand there is a recognition that Meg Oates would make a `less worse' member than Chris Haviland. It would not take much. In Gilmore, it would not take a woman of very high calibre to improve on Mr Peter Knott, whose main contribution as a member of government has been to threaten to shoot local councillors. In Throsby, a mature spinster may be an appropriate replacement for Mr Hollis whose record, in every sense, particularly his record number of overseas trips, is less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Liberal Party has plenty to be proud about when it comes to the promotion of women in politics, certainly there is a long way to go and there is much improvement to be made. I have to recognise that; I concede it. I hope that one of the results of this kind of debate is that more women will be selected in winnable seats by both parties. The Liberal Party believes in equal opportunity in our society and the presence of women in all spheres of politics is necessary to legitimise this belief. We believe it to be true and something we should support strongly, particularly on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which women of merit are failing to get into the parliament is a matter of major concern. We do not resolve the problem of merit, however, by having quotas. We reject this tokenistic solution being peddled by our opponents&mdash;in particular these proposals to introduce a strict quota system for women&mdash;because such proposals are not only tokenistic; they are simplistic, counterproductive and demeaning to women. They are saying to women, `You are sufficiently politically incompetent that you cannot get into a parliament without some kind of special deal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our opponents talk about quotas, we are getting on with the job. I will cite one example of what we are doing in New South Wales. An initiative of the Liberal Party's women council in New South Wales a few months ago was the publication of a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Take Your Seats</EMPHASIS>. I must say it is very timely. This practical guide to help women seek preselection is yet another very practical and very public indication by the Liberal Party in New South Wales and by the Fahey government of the commitment to enhance the status of women in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the state government created a separate Ministry for the Status and Advancement of Women, the first ministry of its type in Australia. This ministry provides the government with high level advice on a wide range of issues affecting women right across the state. It is a slight change of pace from Prime Minister Hawke's Office of the Status of Women, whose major contribution was to provide $11,000 for the left-handed curious female surfboard inventor who had never learnt how to ride a surfboard. The Liberal Party, as I said, has much to be proud of in relation to women in politics, but there is clear room for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the state Labor opposition's record in New South Wales: on women it is a giant embarrassment. That is why senior female MPs such as Jeannette McHugh have attacked this proposal as nothing but a joke and a ruse. Even Mr Carr's own shadow minister for women, Pam Allan, has described the proposals being pushed as a move by the right wing of the ALP to promote women who are, in her words, `fairly compliant or cronies of head office'. That is what this hypocritical nonsense from the Labor Party is all about.

That is not the way we should be looking at this debate. If members of the Liberal Party believe in equal opportunity and think they care for their women, why was it necessary for them to put out a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Take Your Seats</EMPHASIS>?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Shape of Things to Come</EMPHASIS>, is a welcome recognition of the importance of small businesses and the need to foster them. As the report shows, the majority of employment in Australia comes from small business. As big companies continue job shedding, more and more people will be involved in small business or will be self-employed. Some of the measures suggested here are important and have our support. Certainly programs to make some training available for owners, managers and workers in small business will be of help. Having a freely available publication of examples of other small businesses that have done well and having the database are good ideas. Recommendation No. 9, which suggests that the role of intermediaries such as accountants, banks, lawyers and other service providers should be examined and made more supportive of small business, seems a crucial task to engage in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there is an extremely heavy weighting on training and the assumption seems to be that, as with the unemployed, government training programs are all that is required to make small businesses go. The database idea is good, but it appears that the report recommends it essentially as a way of accessing or slotting into the right programs. In fact, the training industry appears to be the one heavily stimulated here, and there is some tie-in with the idea of privatising employment training and services functions carried out by DEET and the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other worrying recommendations. Recommendation No. 16 suggests that another level of certification should be imposed upon society. Small businesses would have to qualify for certification as a small business. Recommendation No. 5 talks about setting benchmarks for best practice. Recommendation No. 15 seems to involve picking winners. Recommendation No. 13 works on incorporating `entrepreneurship' into education to create `desired' small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the shape of things to come, I, for one, am concerned enough to suggest that that shape should be radically changed. While there is no requirement yet for small businesses to take up various areas of government training or any particular program, making it a requirement to do training sufficient to get a competency certificate in small business management simply puts another barrier or set of barriers between small businesses and any program meant to help. It is another set of hoops to jump through at a time when small business already complains about the level of bureaucracy it must contend with. It seems that government has decided to be heavily paternalistic and not only assist but also direct small business, one of the few places where diversity and vitality are still allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could be very positive. The database, for example, could be used to assist small business to connect with other small and medium enterprises that are potential suppliers and customers or for cooperative arrangements. We could have seen some suggestions to move towards a less bureaucratic treatment of small business. We could have seen some major suggestions about improving the economic climate in which small business has to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This economic climate is one where it is very difficult for small businesses to access loans. It is expensive to rent properties. Very often they have to pay expensive overheads for things they do not need or use. For example, they may have to split water costs even though there is no tap or toilet on the premises. They also have to compete with large national and transnational corporations that may effectively dominate wholesale markets and are able to manipulate prices to the detriment of small businesses. There are often no means of bringing goods effectively to market at costs that are affordable to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous good ideas around, some of which small businesses themselves are working at implementing, sometimes over government resistance. I refer to LETS as an example. One meaning for this acronym is `local enterprise trading scheme'; another is the `local energy transfer system'. But no matter what the acronym specifically means in a specific area, LETS is where small businesses can get resources or services through direct exchanges where cash is short. The government actively resisted this until recently, when the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) began to realise how much genuine good the system did for the battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, there is no reason why we could not implement a Grameen Bank style of scheme to help small businesses to get access to capital.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support Senator Margetts and the great bulk of what she had to say, particularly the points she made about the risk of too much bureaucracy intervening in this area of small business and in governmental support particularly in terms of basic skills and so on. Also, I must say that I accept her view that access to finance appears in many instances to be discriminatory in relation to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing we have to recognise is that small business is not a small part of the Australian economy. There are over 780,000 non-agricultural private sector businesses in Australia. I mention `non-agricultural' because all family farms are small businesses and their number would enormously boost this figure. Ninety-six per cent, or 757,000, of these private sector businesses in Australia are small businesses. These firms employ 2.57 million people, or about 51 per cent, of the non-agricultural private sector work force and contribute almost 30 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. So small businesses are obviously a very important part of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial proportion of these businesses, about 55 per cent or I think about 418,000 of them, are self-employed people&mdash;in other words, they do not employ anyone&mdash;or are working proprietors in partnerships. Together they account for something like 801,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further 212,000 firms&mdash;that is, 22 per cent&mdash;employ fewer than five people. So they are very personal small businesses. This is an area where so many Australians feel that they have the right&mdash;and they should&mdash;to have a go, to try to be their own person and to make their own contribution. This is the area in which there have been in the past the greatest number of failures, the greatest number of problems and&mdash;during the recession we had to have&mdash;an excessive number of families and their livelihoods destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that improved skill levels are an important element in improving the situation. The report notes that there are some positive signs that the average level of skills among small business owner-managers is on the rise, that small business recognition of the need for continuing skills development is also increasing and that small business owner-managers appear to have a positive attitude towards employing people with post-school qualifications.

<PARA>It is interesting to note&mdash;and I raise this as a problem that has to be resolved&mdash;that one of the items in the Advance to the Minister for Finance totals $167; that is all. I do not know what the administrative cost of putting up this item would have been, but I imagine it would have run into thousands of dollars with the bureaucratic work involved, the processing in this place and so on. It seems to me that that is a silly system. A private sector operation would have a thing called petty cash. I presume that when we are talking about billions of dollars, as we do in this place, it seems dopey that we have to go through the same sorts of forms for $167 as we would if it were $167 million. Surely we can improve the system. Let us see exactly what this was about. It is stated:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cole will be compensated for nine days payment of the Austudy Independent Living Allowance. This was on the basis that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was entitled to it and was financially disadvantaged through not receiving it. It was not understood at the time that the Secretary approved the payment that it was necessary to arrange for additional funds to be appropriated. Consequently, the appropriation of the funds was not dealt within the Budget context and accordingly the AMF is sought on the grounds of erroneously omitted.</PARA>

<PARA>Apart from the general question of why it took from February to August for this person to be paid what he was entitled to allegedly within 30 days, we have to call on the ministry for finance&mdash;the government and the minister&mdash;to find ways of improving the procedure because it is an absolute nonsense and waste of time and money.

<PARA>I begin by quoting a report from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chicago Tribune</EMPHASIS> of 10 December 1991. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police recently raided a Bangkok sweatshop that produces paper cups and rescued 31 children who had been locked in a small room. Not one was older than 13. A shocked police officer said the weeping children clung to the legs of his officers. They were emaciated and suffering from malnutrition. They had been beaten so badly that most needed to be carried to freedom. Many had skin diseases. They told of being thrashed if they failed to make 700 paper cups a day: by hand. Police suspect that to keep them awake during sadistically long workdays, the owner . . . gave them amphetamine tablets . . . One 13-year-old told police he had been beaten unconscious twice when he tried to escape.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be easy to stand here and recite horror stories one after another about child labour exploitation in Third World countries. Examples such as the one I have just given are not rare and that example related to only 31 children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions estimates that between 100 million and 200 million of the world's children between the ages of four and 15 are `labouring in mines, making matches, selling gum in the streets, cooking, washing clothes, working as domestic servants, weaving carpets, making clothes, sewing underwear, and working in the fields, at the plantations and on building sites round the world'. Two hundred million children are being robbed of their childhood and suffering appalling conditions&mdash;much of it, let it be said, in the employ of Western multinationals. It would be easy, as I said, simply to stand here and recount these horror stories. One might think that doing that would be enough to shame our government into action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on Tuesday when I asked the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, about child labour he acknowledged the problem. He said, `We recognise that the problem of child labour exists in our region.' To recount horror stories would serve no purpose. The government acknowledges the problem, but still refuses to take action. That bears repeating: the government acknowledges the obscene exploitation of children in factories in our region, but it still refuses to take action. It will not restrict imports produced using child labour. It will not legislate to control the behaviour of Australian firms operating offshore in their treatment of labour. It continues to push its economic rationalist trade deregulation agenda, both in GATT and in APEC, without demanding the inclusion of social clauses to protect workers and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the government not take action against child labour exploitation in other countries and not only does it refuse to legislate to ensure at least that Australian consumers and firms do not inadvertently support such practices, but it continues to pursue a trade agenda in international forums which blindly ignores that child labour exploitation is an inevitable consequence of so-called free trade. That freedom from regulation for the work that is being carried out in our region includes the freedom to mistreat and to exploit some of the most vulnerable human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the reasons given for the government's failure to act? Apart from Senator McMullan's accusations in his response to my question on Tuesday that I was proposing `feel-good' measures, he advanced a number of rationalisations of this government's appalling failure to act. So rather than recite horror stories, it would be more productive to address those rationalisations. Firstly, let me quote a report from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 18 August 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, also called on the Federal Government to take a stronger line on Australian companies not observing basic workers' rights and international labour conventions overseas. `I think the Commonwealth Government should be more aggressive on these issues,' he said.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust Senator McMullan phoned Mr Ferguson and told him that his suggestions were also, as he said to me, half-cocked and feel-good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his first words in answer to my question on Tuesday Senator McMullan expressed puzzlement that I referred to the passage of legislation against child sex exploitation, saying that he could not see how that added to the debate. The point is that the Australian parliament has now set a precedent. It has taken the view that it has a responsibility to control the behaviour of Australians abroad where that behaviour is exploitative and obscene. But it is no less obscene for children to be beaten senseless and fed amphetamines to keep them working 14 hours a day in dangerous and unhealthy conditions for a pittance than for them to be exploited for perverted sexual gratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, then, can we not legislate to control the behaviour of Australian firms overseas? One of the direct results of the government's trade liberalisation agenda is that Australian firms are increasingly under pressure to relocate production offshore so that they can remain cost competitive. Like it or not, this means that some Australian firms&mdash;perhaps inadvertently or unknowingly&mdash;are supporting or sanctioning child labour exploitation, if not directly, then through the subcontractors that they use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quintupling of the rate of Australian investments offshore over the last four years&mdash;which Senator Cook, in answer to another of my questions in this chamber, cited as a healthy trend&mdash;may in fact be contributing to one of the world's greatest human tragedies. As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) has said in the other place, `Pimp or factory owner: what is the difference?' Until we legislate, the difference is that an Australian who exploits children for sex offshore faces up to 17 years imprisonment, while an Australian who exploits children as factory fodder offshore gets increased profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second argument for obscene inaction advanced by Senator McMullan on Tuesday was that child labour was `fundamentally a result of poverty'. He argued against trade sanctions `which will do nothing to reduce the level of poverty in the country and may make it worse'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan would have more credibility in taking this line if the government's record on aid matters were not so disgraceful. Our aid budget has fallen from 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1983, when Labor took office, to 0.34 per cent of GDP at the present time. The government's once strongly stated commitment to increasing that ratio to the UN target of 0.7 per cent gets expressed more fuzzily and more half-heartedly every time we hear it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that aid budget, despite continuing pressure from the non-government organisations community, more and more of it is addressed to programs focused on generating commercial returns to Australia rather than poverty alleviation in Third World countries. The most direct impact we could have on child labour through the aid budget would be to support primary education. Primary education, combined with free school food, has been shown in many surveys to keep children out of the work force. Yet of the roughly $200 million a year spent on education in the aid budget, over 90 per cent goes on tertiary education, and most of it is aid aimed at the rich to get them to attend and therefore support our own universities. One should ask the question: how many scholarships for poor and disadvantaged school children and students have we funded through our aid program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fallacious for Senator McMullan to argue that acting against child labour might worsen poverty. As pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Economic Review</EMPHASIS> of 9 July 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tiny wages actually drawn by the children make little difference to family income, child workers not only seem to displace the adult workers but also seem to depress the incomes of adults doing similar work.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, failing to take action may worsen the poverty. Senator McMullan's argument is also weak when we consider the extent to which multinational firms are involved in child exploitation. It is not as if these companies cannot afford to hire adult workers or pay decent wages. By letting them continue to exploit child labour, we actually facilitate greater appropriation of labour value added by Western capitalists and consumers. We help them to rip-off developing countries and keep the Third World in poverty. Demanding that these firms pay a fair wage for adult labour is one of the best ways to fight poverty in developing countries. These are two of the arguments Senator McMullan used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the next one. He argued that we should not take action against some imports which we know use child labour because we cannot identify all the offenders. `So the people who are good at disguising their obnoxious behaviour should continue to trade with us, but not the ones that do it so openly!' he exclaimed. All I can say is I am glad that he is not the Minister for Justice. Since we cannot catch all the murderers and rapists, should we let the ones that we do know go scot-free?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan also argues that it would be extremely difficult to identify goods that are produced with child labour. For one thing, he is not right. International networks do exist, and organisations such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions undertake inspections and report on instances of child labour exploitation. Even if he were right, does the difficulty of catching a crook justify letting him or her get away with murder? There are many Australians who are sickened by child labour practices. Few, if any, would knowingly support such practices by buying products based on the destruction of a child's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not want to buy such products. How much harder will it be for individual consumers to identify products than for the government? Obviously, very much harder. The government has a responsibility to prevent Australian consumers becoming unwitting accomplices to the crime of child labour exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties with identifying offences and offenders in the sex tourism area has not prevented us from passing legislation directed at combating that particular obnoxious practice. We have anti-dumping legislation where we need to identify producers, the costs of their production and the products that are being dumped on our markets. Yet that information is not only obtainable, it is being obtained on a regular basis. So the argument that it is difficult to identify the products and their origin does not hold much water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last argument Senator McMullan put to defend the gutless inaction of his government was an assertion that, `It will have to be a multilateral solution; it cannot be a bilateral solution.' If by `multilateral solution' he means continual international talkfests where everyone stands up and denounces child labour exploitation but no-one actually does anything, then I have my doubts. Senator McMullan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are trying very hard to work on improving labour standards in our region . . . through our support for the ILO in Asia, through our tripartite government, union and employer delegations.</PARA>
<PARA>But what have we really done except talk about the issue, and maybe exhort foreign governments? Do we expect a gale of hot air blowing up through South-East Asia from down south to be enough to beat down practices which are exploiting millions of children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sociologist B.N. Juyal has made it very clear that the main impetus for change comes from implicit threats of import bans by consumer countries. This is even recognised in the countries threatened by such sanctions. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indian Express</EMPHASIS> in an editorial on 1 February 1994 it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only piece of legislation on child labour that seems to have had a wholesome effect in India is ironically the Child Labour Deterrence Act introduced into the United States Senate by Tom Harkin.</PARA>
<PARA>That bill proposed the establishment of a labelling system where products guaranteed as being made without child labour will be sheltered from restrictions. Even before this bill was debated in the United States Congress, the Bangladesh Textile Exporting Industry Association had put increased pressure on its affiliates to clean up their factories and their practices. The biggest impact of the debate generated by such legislation is the pressure it puts on manufacturers. They will take action; they will respond if their markets, if their sales are threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firms like Levis and Ikea have taken internal action to ensure that child labour does not occur in their production lines or at the subcontractor level. The potential brand-name damage that could be done to such companies by failing to qualify for a `Guaranteed free from child labour' label is a tremendous force for change but it will only follow if legislation exists that is directed towards keeping such products out of our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bilateral action is possible and is effective. The Americans insisted upon, and actually got, a so-called `side agreement' with Mexico on environmental standards as part of the NAFTA negotiations. Why can we not insist upon similar social clauses in any trade liberalisation agreements arising out of APEC negotiations? Why can we not push for side agreements on child labour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 November 1993 I gave notice of a motion calling on the government to establish an APEC international social and ecological development authority advisory committee to look at issues such as this. What has the government done about it? I suspect the answer is: nothing. The government's trade deregulation agenda for APEC might lead to gains from trade for all and a general rise in living standards and working conditions; but it may also lead to a race to the bottom as countries compete to become lowest cost producers by slashing labour and environmental standards. In this scenario investment will be attracted by regimes which offer cheap labour and minimal interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a driving down of standards would hurt even Australia. Indeed, the growth of a sweatshop outworker industry in Melbourne as detailed by Paul Heinrichs in a series of articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>recently demonstrates that it is already happening. Either of these outcomes is possible: trade can bring plenty or poverty. We have to push for trade regimes that raise standards rather than lower them, and that means insisting on `social clauses' in any trade deregulation agreements. This is not neo-protectionism as Prime Minister Goh of Singapore claimed recently but a real concern for workers in developing and developed countries alike and for the children in particular in these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There really is no excuse for inaction. Pursuing multilateral solutions is commendable but it is not enough. We support the call by the ACTU for social clauses to be included in GATT; but to wait for multilateral sanctions may be like waiting for Godot. ILO convention No. 5 from as long ago as 1919 called for a minimum age in industry. Where are the enforcement provisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone has to go first but we would not be first. Senator Tom Harkin in the United States was first; he showed us the way, so why do we not take similar action? International restrictions on trade in goods made from child labour must start somewhere. If Australia imposes such restrictions others are more likely to follow. If every country self-interestedly says it is too hard to take action, as Senator McMullan does, then 200 million children around the world will continue to suffer, including an additional 80,000 who are estimated to start work every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without sanctions child labour will always be attractive to unscrupulous employers. Children are easier to discipline and children can be forced to accept hazardous working conditions. They are also, of course, cheaper to employ. The International Council of Free Trade Unions reports that in Nepal children in the carpet industry are often not paid at all. That certainly does not do much for poverty. The only cost to the employer is when he or she buys the children from their parents. This is just obscenely wrong, and right and wrong should not wait on collective decision making, getting everybody under a head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's failure to take action is no less wrong if no other countries are taking action. This is an issue where Australia should lead, where Australia should act unilaterally, as in fact Australia has acted unilaterally to reduce tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats call on the Australian government to act now and to take substantive, tangible action rather than limiting itself to going, `Tut, tut' at international meetings of bureaucrats. We demand: action to restrict imports made from child labour; introduction of a labelling system to identify imports guaranteed free from child labour; legislation to ensure Australian companies operating offshore meet minimum standards in employee working conditions; Australia to take a lead role in the negotiation of social clauses as part of GATT; Australia to take a lead role in ensuring that any APEC trade liberalisation agreements include social clauses addressing labour rights and the environment; immediate establishment of an APEC international social and ecological development advisory committee to advise the Prime Minister on social and ecological issues which should be addressed in Australia and in the region as a result of the initiatives taken by participating countries in the area of trade, finance and industry; and, to underpin it all, the government should at long last, after being two years late, discharge its obligation to provide a progress report to the United Nations on the degree of implementation of the convention on the rights of the child. </PARA>

That is a reality and it is a very real concern. The question for debate this afternoon is how definite results might be accomplished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view and, I believe, in the view of the government, it is a question that requires concerted international action. I take as an example a situation with which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would be only too familiar: the concerted international campaign to dissolve apartheid in South Africa. That could not be achieved bilaterally; it could not be achieved by unilateral action on the part of countries, however well intentioned&mdash;and I refer to Canada and India, as well as Australia. It required concerted international action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take a circumstance such as the continued abuse of human rights in Burma, where Australia has continually urged multilateral action, it has only been in very recent times with ASEAN post-ministerial consultations that Australia could achieve broad agreement on a range of policy propositions directed to ensuring that change could be effected in that country. The experience is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue with Senator Spindler to the extent that he tended to brush aside the issue of concealment. That issue is very real. No-one should be under any doubt about the fact that concealment of this obscene trade is intrinsic to its continuation; concealment is intrinsic to it flourishing. Where it is identified and exposed, measures can be taken, international pressures can be applied and it can be brought to an end. Concealment is central to the continuation of the abuse of these youngsters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing those remarks in mind, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b), omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)calls on the Australian Government to continue to play an active role in developing within the international community effective measures to eliminate such exploitation of children, and asks the Government to report to the Senate during the sitting week starting 7 November 1994 on the effective action the Australian Government can take to give effect to the concerns of the Australian people on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a fairly narrow area of disagreement between the proposition as amended by Senator Spindler and the amendment I have moved on behalf of the government. I stress the use of the word `effective'. It may be that a simple legislative approach turns out to be too narrow. There may be other means that can be adopted in concert with the trade union movement, the business community, the media, multi-lateral agencies and through international pressure whereby more can be achieved than by simply carrying a law in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should stress that Australia is a strong supporter of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. We were closely involved in the development of the convention itself. It was adopted in 1989 and we ratified it a little over a year later in September of 1990. The task before us is to translate that into concrete action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention imposes an obligation on the parties to it to take such legislative and other action with respect to children within their own jurisdiction as is appropriate to bringing an end to the kind of abuse we are debating this afternoon. Obviously, the government is totally committed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More broadly, we are also concerned with abuses of children wherever such abuses occur internationally. But I reinforce Senator McMullan's observation at question time yesterday: the key to a responsible approach on this matter is not just feeling good about what we say&mdash;about our rhetoric; it is a matter of actually achieving good, of actually seeing concrete accomplishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is taking particular steps to support the improvement of labour conditions in our region&mdash;obviously, that has to be a priority and it is&mdash;and that includes those circumstances that pertain to child labour. There are a number of programs but, in particular, there is Australian support for the ILO objectives in Asia program, ASILO. For example, in Vietnam, the program is directed towards strengthening the relationship between labour laws and practices with an aim to ratifying international labour conventions on workplace safety, developing industrial hygiene practices, introducing industrial relations practices more generally and strengthening legitimate worker bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Indonesia there is a memorandum of understanding on cooperation on industrial relations issues signed in 1993 which provides a framework for cooperation on issues affecting child labour. That is a matter where there has been a positive response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own perspective, I have much sympathy with introducing the social clause into the new world trading arrangements, particularly relating to labour standards and environmental measures. I say that quite openly. But I do not simply dismiss Prime Minister Goh's remarks the other night that that clause may potentially be exploited by neo-protectionists; that it may well prove to be a weapon for protectionists operating under a new guise. I support the clause but I think we need to be careful about the manner in which people may seek to use it for ends not consistent with the spirit of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler also tended to brush aside the key concept of poverty. There is no doubt in my mind that there was more than a grain of truth in Senator McMullan's observation about poverty alleviation being a crucial response in the reduction of the problems of child labour abuses and the appalling conditions in plants in which children are currently working, particularly in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poverty alleviation is a key objective of the Australian aid program in promoting sustainable economic and social advancement of people in developing countries; particularly those more vulnerable groups such as women and children. The Australian government's program includes support for activities which expand the range of employment and income earning opportunities as well as measures which build human resource and institutional capacities across all sectors of society, particularly in respect of health and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give just a couple of examples to advance the argument in the chamber this afternoon. In partner countries, for example, basic education for children and adults is a priority area, as identified by UNICEF. Total expenditure on primary and secondary education activities through the aid program in 1992-93 was of the order of $15 1/2 million. Another program involves support for an income generating project in Thailand implemented by ECPAT, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, through the small assistance scheme administered by our embassy in Bangkok. A further program involves a current assessment of a larger longer term ECPAT project through its South-East Asia regional program aimed at eliminating child prostitution in Asia. I can think of few more worthwhile examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is in question that Australia is a strong supporter of key ILO conventions pertaining to child labour, freedom from forced or compulsory labour, freedom of association, freedom from discrimination, the right to organise and bargain collectively, and certain absolute minimum work conditions. Currently, the government is consulting with the states and territories as a matter of priority so that we can proceed to ratification of the ILO's minimum age convention No. 138 which deals with the issue of child labour comprehensively. That is a concrete example of the kind of action that we have taken and are taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia looks, with good reason, to the International Labour Organisation having the central role in strengthening adherence to internationally recognised labour standards and continually supports proposals to make the ILO more effective, in not only our region but globally. With regard to child labour, Australia is monitoring the ILO International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour, IPEC, which was launched in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IPEC mobilises at grassroots the forces best placed to translate ILO principles into practice&mdash;governments, employers, worker and non-government organisations in the field. The government is currently considering means by which it can contribute to the program. Measures include support for efforts to put an end to intolerable situations such as the employment of children who are very young or in hazardous occupations or working under slavery conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add a personal note by saying that I was very moved by the report that Senator Spindler read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chicago Tribune</EMPHASIS>. I doubt whether any senator in this place could have failed to have been moved. It is an absolute disgrace that in 1994 on this planet such things occur, regardless of where they occur. But again it comes back, in my view, to the best means of addressing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of IPEC, the Australian government currently is also looking at information and awareness measures to try to change attitudes and behavioural patterns and the effective ways that that might be accomplished. It is also considering further measures which, without explicitly targeting child labour, nonetheless act very directly on the underlying causes&mdash;unemployment, poverty, inadequate social protection and educational systems and passive acceptance in the host countries of this appalling problem. I think it is fair to say that programs already in place and to which reference was made a little earlier have already served to contribute to the aims of IPEC, and the government intends to contribute further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government supports the improvement of labour standards in our region, including those pertaining to child labour, through a number of other programs&mdash;in particular, through one to which I referred very early in my remarks, the Australian support for ILO objectives in Asia, ASILO, program. This program began in 1993 with over $1 million committed to activities in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. It is a project with a tripartite basis, with resources drawn from the ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Vietnam and Indonesia there are endeavours already under way. Taking a broader perspective: in China the program is directed at strengthening China's ability to implement the provisions of conventions relating to construction safety, developing industrial hygiene practices and normalising industrial relations practices in a general sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Malaysia, on the other hand, the program is directed at strengthening Malaysia's capacity to address issues of chemical safety and occupational health and safety as well as structures for remuneration and productivity based wages. In Thailand, similarly, the program addresses issues of industrial hygiene and occupational health and safety. These are concrete steps in place. The important point in such cooperative programs is that they greatly enhance the access and influence of Australian labour practitioners and, from that, greater acceptance of a range of labour related issues, including moves to abolish unacceptable child labour practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my remarks on the note with which I began. I doubt that anyone in the chamber would argue that Senator Spindler is wrong to raise the issue and to canvass it comprehensively in the chamber this afternoon. There is no doubt that the debate is necessary and focuses on a very real concern. But in terms of a response, a comprehensive response is what we require. That is why I believe the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the government is a better way of the Senate seeking to address the problem by having the government, as Senator Spindler asked, come back by 7 November with propositions on how we in Australia might effectively respond&mdash;not by simply focusing on the aspect of legislation but, within the context of a range of measures, including legislation. The government can come back to the chamber and say that the nature and scale of the problem are such and it requires a comprehensive answer, thereby making specific recommendations to the Senate. For that reason, I commend the proposition which I have moved by way of amendment this afternoon to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has raised a topic of importance today asking that the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . re-affirms Australia's opposition to the economic exploitation of children . . . recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Loosley has said, I do not think anybody in this chamber would disagree with the sentiments in Senator Spindler's motion. I believe there would be few Australians who, irrespective of whether we have signed an international convention or not, would not support the sentiment of this motion that we abhor exploitation of children in any form, whether it be sexual exploitation or economic exploitation. I am sure that we would have to go a long way to find somebody in Australia who would disagree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child labour is probably the most pernicious form of child abuse. It is to be condemned because it robs children of the building blocks of a healthy and positive adulthood. When a child is forced into labour, it usually means that that child is unable to experience the activities that we see young children here in Australia having the opportunity to enjoy, such as playing, growing and of learning through play. All that is taken away when a child is forced into labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those of us in this chamber who are child psychologists&mdash;there seems to be an ever increasing number of people who have had some experience in psychology, especially in developmental psychology, coming into parliament&mdash;would agree from our professional point of view, and I do not want to speak for the Acting Deputy President but I am sure she would agree, that that early part of childhood when a child plays and experiences freedom and the opportunity to enjoy life without having to work for no pay or for pay is a time when their adulthood and the building blocks of their adult life are being constructed. </PARA>

I am sure that if she were speaking on this, she would agree that that period of life is very important for later development. We may think that is a foregone conclusion, but one only has to read our own literature and look at our own heritage to see that people did not always believe that. They thought that children were little adults, that they could work and that it did not have any effect on their later development. It was with hindsight and understanding about child development that we realised it was important that children have love and the opportunity to play, because we discovered what children learn through those activities. So it is not something that we have always known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always very easy to be critical of others when, in fact, we only have to look at Dickens and some of the child labour that went on in Britain to know that even within our own culture that has happened. The Director-General of the ILO, Michel Hansenne, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Childhood is a period of life which should be devoted, not to work but to education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>I would add, `and to play'. I would also add that it should be a period when there is time and opportunity to grow physically, socially and emotionally and to play and enjoy a real childhood. I agree with the rest of his statement, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child labour, by its very nature and the working conditions in which it is carried out, often compromises children's potential to become productive and useful adults in society; finally, the use of child labour is not inevitable, and progress toward its elimination is possible whenever there is political will to oppose it with determination.</PARA>
<PARA>Millions of children around the world are involved in child labour, and it would appear that the numbers are growing. There are millions of child-bonded labourers&mdash;children who are kidnapped to be imprisoned in sweatshops or brothels, millions who work unseen in domestic service who are given or sold at a very early age to another family and often receive little or no pay and have no control over their lives. In many cases, neither do their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues Senator Spindler and Senator Loosley have outlined some cases of exploitation of child labour. In looking at this issue, I have read about children as young as six from poor rural families in some countries who are sold or given to better off families to work in involuntary servitude. I have read about cases in Thailand where there have been numerous allegations of widespread use of forced child labour for labour intensive workshops and the child sex industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently talking to somebody from one of the Asian countries who said that as Thailand tightens up its laws, we will see some of the sex tourism shifting to other Asian countries where the rules are less tight. We have to be very vigilant to ensure that when one country tightens its rules, there is not a shift to another country where the rules are less tight, thus affording the opportunity to exploit children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago I read a book written by an Irish woman who was a street child in Dublin. I cannot remember the name of this book and I do not think anybody in the chamber would be able to help me. This woman recently visited Australia. She has been working in Vietnam. One only has to read that story to hear some of the tragic cases of child exploitation. She lives with and works amongst homeless children. It is a very sad story. She was a homeless child and an abused wife. As a young woman, she had a dream that she wanted to help children in Vietnam, and she believed that she could make that dream come true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She went to Vietnam with almost no money, and she finally convinced various authorities that she would set up facilities for homeless young children, in particular children of a very young age&mdash;four, five and six. After hearing her talk about extracting children from hotels at the age of four and five when they had been enticed into the hotel room by people wanting to exploit them, one realises that it happens and it is often perpetrated by people not from the developing countries. So it happens and it shifts from one country to another. I would love to remember the name of the book so I could recommend it to honourable senators, because it is a very salutary book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, in Thailand and rural areas, child capturers and recruiters travel around taking children from poor families. At the same time, certain shops in cities specialise in selling children and teenagers. In January 1992, the Thai government reported to the ILO that it had filed charges against the owner of a sweatshop in Bangkok where 31 workers aged between nine and 20 were employed making paper cups. Senator Spindler referred to that example. It was reported that some of the children had been rescued, and they had been so badly beaten that they could hardly walk. They had all been forced to work 18-hour days, sitting on a cement floor to fill their daily quota, and they were never allowed to leave the sweatshop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Thailand tightens up its conditions of employment, especially those applying to children, we may see&mdash;especially if there are multinational corporations employing children&mdash;those people with wealth who are setting up the companies, and even people from those countries, moving to other countries where the rules are less tight. So we need to be vigilant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other stories where one reads about children as young as six in Colombia working in coal mines. Senator Spindler has outlined examples of children working in carpet factories in Nepal and India. One such story that I read was about a young boy of eight years of age in Bihar state, India. This would have been in 1991. He was working as a cowherd for 20 rupees, about US78c at that stage, when a carpet manufacturer came along. In an article about this case, there is a quote from the young boy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They told my father that your son will get good clothing, good food, plus Rs 350 a month . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So his father said, `Okay,' and three of the children from that family went off to work for the carpet manufacturer. They spent the first two months without pay and, if they were slow, they were beaten very hard with sticks on the back. The young boy said, `They used to lock us up at night.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After six months, the young boys got a letter out. Somebody literate who was working with them got a letter out to their father to tell him what was happening and that they were not getting paid. The father came down and the carpet manufacturer said, `We will pay them in the long run. We will pay them in two months, and we will send them back with their pay.' That did not ever happen and the boys escaped. They were picked up by a welfare organisation and, under the legislation that now exists in India, they were released. The young boy was interviewed, and he was asked what he wanted to do now that he had been released. He said, `I want to go to school.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one example of where parents were tricked into believing that these young people were going to be paid&mdash;whether or not they were paid is another thing. Not only were the parents cajoled into letting their children go into the work force, but they were not paid for it. So it is exploitation at its very worst form in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Economic Review</EMPHASIS> in July 1992 reported that children as young as six were working in appalling conditions in carpet factories and tea plantations in India. It also stated that child workers in India typically worked from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. with half an hour for lunch and would sometimes work until midnight. Payment was on a piece rate. Food was normally watery. There was also a high incidence of TB, worm infestations, skin ulcers and enlarged lymph glands and physical and verbal abuse was routine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to be very careful that we do not miss the mote in our own eye when we are looking at the splinter in our neighbour's eye. I do not think that child labour occurs only in developing countries. I believe that if we were to search we would also find examples in the developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and even, dare I say it, Australia. We also need to be aware that some of this child labour can be directly or indirectly through multinationals controlled by western countries which are either wittingly or unwittingly involved in child labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That places me in some difficulty with Senator Spindler's first motion: it may not be possible because there may be hidden exploitation which we cannot identify. I think Senator Loosley referred to that. Even with legislation prohibiting the importation of products made using child labour, we cannot always be sure that we are not purchasing or importing products where the fact that children are exploited in the processing of that product is hidden. We have to try to find other methods of indicating to the international community our view that the use of child labour and the exploitation of children is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support the sentiment behind a move to prohibit importation of goods produced by child labour, as I have indicated it is not that easy to implement. It is difficult to place and police restrictions on importing goods produced by child labour both in Australia and in the originating country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not claim to be an expert on child labour and the exploitation of children&mdash;I am glad Senator Spindler has raised this matter because it makes me and my colleagues more aware of it&mdash;but I read a document this afternoon whilst researching this matter that said, `Let them bring in legislation. We can tell them that we are not employing children and we can get away with it.' I guess we have to change the culture and indicate that it is unacceptable worldwide to exploit children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, we cannot look at the splinter in our neighbour's eye and not look for the mote in our own. Currently in Australia we have 70,000 young homeless people, we have acts of violence against young people that would have been totally unknown in the time in which we were growing up, and we have a youth unemployment rate which is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we look at some of our neighbours and ask them to address some of the issues that they need to look at, we also need to call on our own government to look at some of the issues which are affecting young people in this country, because we stand condemned and this government stands condemned in the way it has dealt with its own youth in the areas of homelessness, violence against our children and in youth unemployment. </PARA>

These two reports were <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Deed of agreement</EMPHASIS>, which would reveal that the Queensland government is hell-bent on getting the Port Hinchinbrook development up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that it is quite prepared to pursue a high risk strategy, gambling with the conservation of World Heritage values in order to get this development off the ground. I believe the role of the Queensland government in this development needs to be fully exposed. The environmental assessment process has been a complete sham. It was taken out of the hands of the environment and heritage department and put into the hands of the Office of the Coordinator General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Coordinator General is a fast-tracking unit. Its proper role in some circumstances is to promote development in Queensland. However, it perceives environmental laws as an obstacle to development. It is totally inappropriate for the Queensland government to give responsibility for the environmental assessment of this project to a development agency rather than an environmental agency. Not only that, but the Office of the Coordinator General is arrogant and even antagonistic towards conservation agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the Senate an example. I will quote from a document produced by the Office of the Coordinator General which gives reasons for the conflict between developers and the wet tropics administration. It makes clear that its sympathies and support lie with development as defined by it. Some of the criticisms it levels are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal reason for the conflict outlined above is the fact that the Authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the wet tropics administration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a single purpose organisation; it focuses on its charter of rainforest preservation and feels no responsibility for economic development in the area. One aspect of its charter&mdash;the presentation of the WHA&mdash;could be viewed as compatible with promotion of the tourism industry in the Cairns region. However, this task is pursued less energetically than are those of protection and conservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some Authority members are far from extreme in their views on reasonable development projects, they are somewhat constrained in the action they can take since the Authority's charter says nothing about the economic development of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are strong personalities on the Authority with deeply committed anti-development beliefs who often manage to persuade other members to adopt their views on issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recruitment of staff for the Agency has ensured that most are also prejudiced against development, seeing themselves as having little or no responsibility for the strengthening of the economic base of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Office of the Coordinator General has that attitude towards the environment and the environmental agencies of the Queensland government, it is little wonder that one would question its environmental credentials in preparing the environmental report on the Hinchinbrook area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Coordinator General took control of the Port Hinchinbrook assessment. It took staff and resources out of Molly Robson's office and put them into the Office of the Coordinator General. The Queensland environment minister has been left out in the cold on this development&mdash;and, I believe, for deliberate reasons. The Office of the Coordinator General, with input from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has produced what has been called an environmental review report. This report is supposed to be an environmental impact assessment. I fear that it is a very poor imitation of such an assessment. I will quote from the response from the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories to the Queensland government's environmental report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Environment Portfolio remains concerned about the project proceeding at this time as there is insufficient information to justify the need for the development and to properly assess its environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA>The federal department was critical of the poor attempt at environmental assessment carried out by the Office of the Coordinator General. It is indicative of the superficial regard it gives to environmental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal department recommended that a statement of the natural and cultural values of the area should be prepared. It should include values relating to world heritage and national estate significance; the importance of the area as habitat for endangered and migratory species; and the cultural relevance of the area to the local Aboriginal community. The federal department recommended that the statement should assist the Queensland authorities to prepare a more comprehensive impact assessment of the proposal. It would also fulfil more effectively the first undertaking of the letter of agreement between the Office of the Coordinator General and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I will quote part of that undertaking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the environmental impact assessment for the project will adequately take into account the possible impacts the project may have on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Office of the Coordinator General has done neither of these two things. Indeed, it has refused to develop a more comprehensive environmental assessment. It has refused to develop a statement of natural and cultural values and instead it has thumbed its nose at the federal government and proceeded with the finalisation of a deed of agreement between the Office of the Coordinator General, the Cardwell Shire and the developer. The deed of agreement is a legal document which should have been prepared after the proposal was agreed to and after the publication of a full environmental impact assessment. I believe it is outrageous that the Queensland government has so flouted due process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, Senator Ian Macdonald questioned the integrity of Peter Valentine and the report he has produced for Senator Faulkner. I must say that I fully support the comments made by Senator Reynolds concerning the qualifications and international experience of Mr Valentine. I would like to question the assumptions made in the Loder and Bayly report. Page 4 of the report lists a set of assumptions. I will quote from the assumptions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of this assessment it was assumed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a high standard of environmental control and monitoring will be effected and that appropriate financial and human resources will be allocated with sufficient legal support to ensure that impacts are kept within the limits of acceptable change.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.effective independent environmental auditing with real incentives/disincentives to ensure that it is not expedient or cheaper to accept impacts and pay a small fine.</PARA>
<PARA>How can we assume that independent monitoring and auditing to a very high degree will be carried out when the assessment process is so flawed? Unfortunately, the Queensland government has a history of choosing consultants who will tell it what it wants to hear. Given that, it is revealing that the Loder and Bayly report does state that a number of impacts will occur in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. It is interesting that they are prepared to admit as much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They admit that there will be minimal direct impact on the values associated with the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area, direct impact on national estate values, and minimal direct impact on endangered and migratory species. They say there is a moderate risk of direct impact from the initial canal dredging operation and subsequent maintenance dredging operations. Given the very narrow framework and terms of reference, even the Queensland government's report admits that there will be impacts, although it qualifies these as being minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Goss government has been deliberately irresponsible in managing this project. The environmental assessment should have been managed by the Department of Environment and Heritage, which was, instead, frozen out of the process. The release of the Peter Valentine final report would reveal that there are serious concerns over world heritage values on account of this development. I call on the minister to release this report along with the deed of agreement. The minister should approach the Premier of Queensland, who is responsible for the Office of the Coordinator General, as it is the Office of the Coordinator General which is making decisions on this matter, not the Queensland minister for the environment, Molly Robson. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating an issue which is very important, not just for the environment in North Queensland, at Cardwell in the Hinchinbrook area. There are principles at stake that we have to address seriously in terms of environmental issues being decided on the best possible basis of information so that we get solutions that combine federal, state and local government working together, rather than federal government deciding one way, state government deciding another and poor old local government, as usual, effectively being left to pick up the pieces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking, remember, about world heritage. We are talking about an area that has very special values, not just at the local, state or national level but internationally. The Australian government has ultimate responsibility for making the best possible decision to protect world heritage values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from a book that was written and prepared by Arthur and Margaret Thorsborne. The Thorsbornes are well known in North Queensland. They are well known in the Cardwell community because they were responsible for gaining the understanding of many bushwalkers and many environmentalists in relation to the values of this unique region. I might just read some words of Margaret Thorsborne in opening my contribution to this debate. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we first visited Hinchinbrook in 1964, seeing another boat was a rare occurrence and it was only on a few occasions that anyone else camped at the same time as we did. At that time, as the island first touched our lives we felt secure in the discovery of a wild and beautiful world and gloried in the knowledge that as a national park it would always be so.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose what concerns many of us is how we can ensure that the values of Hinchinbrook&mdash;these very special, now recognised world heritage values&mdash;can be protected in the way that Arthur and Margaret Thorsborne first saw as being so necessary as long ago as 1964. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate to mention at this time a book that was launched this week&mdash;it has been quite a week for book launches&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Reluctant Nation: Environment Law and Politics in Australia</EMPHASIS> by Phillip Toyne. I believe that Phillip Toyne's book will dramatically change and certainly influence for many years to come the debate about the environment, environmental law practice and the behaviour of local, state and federal government in this country. It will be a very significant debate in the coming years. I would like to quote from chapter 1 of his book. Honourable senators might wonder how this has anything to do with Hinchinbrook, but I hope they will see that it does. Chapter 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imagine for a moment that you are a green turtle trying to come to grips with Australia's constitutional arrangements. You are a female, swimming in international waters but heading for an island on the Great Barrier Reef to lay your eggs. You enter Australia's exclusive economic zone 200 miles off the coast; you enter Australia's national waters 12 miles off the coast; as you approach the reef you enter the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which is the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. While in the sea of the Marine Park, approaching the island, the waters are Commonwealth (unless you are within three miles of the coastline, but outside the Park, in which case you are in State waters). But once you climb slowly onto the sand and above the low water mark, you come under the jurisdiction of Queensland. You would need to be a very astute turtle to work out which law is responsible for your protection because the Commonwealth and Queensland have different opinions regarding the definition of low water in relation to an island on a coral reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This complexity is not unique to the Australian sea, to Queensland or to turtles. But it is a reflection of the extraordinary system of federalism we have in Australia, where powers are reluctantly surrendered by the States and assumed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that introduction to Phillip Toyne's book highlights the complexity of the debate that we are having in relation to whether or not, or indeed in what form, Keith Williams's proposal at Oyster Point should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is not just that of the developers, the local council, the state government or the federal government. We have to work those four interests, including that of Keith Williams, into a decision that is appropriate to protect the unique World Heritage values of Hinchinbrook. Of course, we could give other examples, as does Phillip Toyne in his book when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most significant development in this respect is the increasing number of international measures being initiated by nations aware that many environment problems now require multi-national responses.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia is a party to many of these international measures, such as the world heritage convention, the biodiversity convention, trade in protected species, the controlling of whaling, and those protecting migratory birds. There are many other international measures with more being prepared, such as the convention to combat desertification around the globe. These will add to the increasing range of issues under which the Commonwealth will have international obligations, even if they would normally fall exclusively within the responsibility of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example mentioned by Phillip Toyne would be the approval of a tourist resort on the coast. This would usually be a state matter. But, if the site chosen were the habitat of migratory birds which each year fly the length of the Pacific, our treaty obligations with Japan to protect both the birds and their habitat might be involved. Of course, in relation to Hinchinbrook, I come back to this being World Heritage and we have to ensure that we protect this unique region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of debate about how much support there has been and how much work the state government and the federal government have each done, whether or not we should be listening to the Queensland government's consultants or to Peter Valentine. I have already placed on the public record the international reputation of the federal government's consultant whose field of expertise is eco-tourism and the protection of World Heritage values. I now just remind the Senate of the concerns that were originally raised with the Queensland government, and I would stress that they come back to the Office of the Coordinator General where I believe there was a misunderstanding about the extent of its authority in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a letter which was sent to the Office of the Coordinator General on 3 June 1994. In the letter, the conclusion that the assistant secretary of the world heritage unit came to was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Environment Portfolio remains concerned about the project proceeding at this time as there is insufficient information to justify the need for the development and to properly assess its environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Portfolio believes that the documentation inadequately considers the potential impacts of the Oyster Point proposal on the World Heritage values of the area. We recommend that a much more comprehensive assessment of the proposal be undertaken before any approvals are granted for the continuation of work on the project.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened then was that the Queensland government, to its credit, did seek out a consultant, but I have not seen any more than a couple of pages of the work of that consultant and its final conclusions. Senator Macdonald has quoted in this place that Loder and Bayly were, effectively, unimpressed with the argument that has been put up by the Commonwealth and, indeed, by Peter Valentine. But I think what we have to ask ourselves is: where is that report; has it been open to public scrutiny? No. I have seen a couple of pages, but where is the detail so that we can analyse and make judgments for ourselves on the degree of expertise had by the Queensland government consultants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I understand that a very comprehensive response to the Valentine report is with the federal minister at this moment together with a draft agreement. The Queensland government has already put together a draft agreement before the federal minister has had a chance to assess these reports and to sit down and work this issue out around the table with Mr Williams, with state government and with local government. It is this pre-empting that sometimes occurs in state governments and in local governments that we have to address in the way that Phillip Toyne has challenged us to in his book. The environment does not just stop and the impacts do not just stop because we have created state and, indeed, local government boundaries. That criterion should be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to get an approach that involves the three levels of government. We need to be open in our debate. We need to ensure that we not only recognise the short-term needs of the community&mdash;a tourist resort next year&mdash;but also recognise what is needed to protect this unique area for the next 20, 50, 100 years and more. We have to start taking the long-term view. It is a matter of ensuring that those unique values are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that all the material relating to Hinchinbrook will very soon be open to public scrutiny. I hope the draft agreement that Queensland has put forward will also be open to public scrutiny because we cannot have issues of such significance decided by bureaucrats and others behind closed doors. We have to ensure that the public has the opportunity to assess how effectively these decisions have been taken. The Australian electorate expects this high level of scrutiny. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency is very concerned as a result of the confusion between state and territory laws and how they conflict with federal responsibilities. This has prompted some market research. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a clear majority of Australians believe that the Commonwealth should have the power to fix national problems in the environment. 73 percent believe that the Commonwealth should set uniform standards for air and water pollution. 68 percent believe it should protect plants and animal species, and 62 percent believe it should set uniform standards for soil and land degradation. A minority&mdash;between 25 and 35 percent believe these matters should be left to the States.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, in assessing what is needed in terms of decision-making at Hinchinbrook, Australians seem to believe that the Commonwealth has more power over the environment than is sometimes assumed by state and local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, one of the major issues that has to be addressed about this proposed development&mdash;aside from the world heritage values&mdash;is where the local water supply is coming from. I do not believe that the Cardwell Shire Council has been able to convince many people that there will be an adequate water supply to service such a resort, unless a dam is ultimately proposed in world heritage listed area in the hills behind Cardwell. In that instance, we would have to go through the same debate that we are going through at the moment. So I urge caution on all sides. I urge open debate to ensure that all parties are involved and that we look to the future, not to short-term interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating Senator Woodley's motion No. 1077, which previous speakers have not specifically addressed. They have used it, perhaps appropriately, to have a general discussion about the Oyster Point development. However, I want to deal with the motion before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley's motion is in three parts. First of all, it asks the Senate to support some comments made by a former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, about the protection of the world heritage wilderness of Hinchinbrook Island. It also says that the government should think very carefully before reaching any decision on the area. Secondly, the motion asks the Senate to note various reports on the matter. Thirdly, it calls upon the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, to release the Peter Valentine report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the coalition supports the motion, although we have some difficulty with the wording of paragraph (a). As I said, it asks us to support some comments made by a former Prime Minister, Mr Gough Whitlam. I would be very reluctant to agree with anything that Gough Whitlam said, particularly when Senator Woodley has not informed the Senate of exactly what was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> by a very respected and accurate journalist, Michael Madigan. This article reports on that incident, although it gives only extracts; it does not give a transcript of what Mr Whitlam said. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Whitlam said, while he did not have all the information surrounding the area and the Oyster Point tourist development proposed, he had "no doubt" the World Heritage wilderness of Hinchinbrook Island should be protected . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Whitlam is admitting that he really does not know much about it. As I said, asking the Senate to agree with anything that Mr Whitlam has said would be a danger, particularly when he has commented on something which he admits that he knows little about. I would have thought the better route to follow would be to delete paragraph (a) of Senator Woodley's motion and replace it with the words `supports the protection of Hinchinbrook Island'. Senator Woodley's motion further reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government should think very carefully before reaching any decision on the area . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that the government would think very carefully before reaching a decision on any matter. Again, asking this government to think carefully on any matter is a bit like asking us to support anything that Mr Whitlam has said: it is just something that we would not imagine that it would do. Again, I do not think that will mean much in the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have supplied to the other parties in the chamber copies of my amendment, which seeks to delete paragraph (a) of Senator Woodley's motion and substitute the words `supports the protection of Hinchinbrook Island'. Senator Woodley has indicated to me privately that he is happy enough with that. If that is the case, then it seems that we all agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why the Australian Democrats chose to have this motion debated today. Yesterday, both Senator Kernot and Senator Woodley quoted at some length from the Peter Valentine report. As far as I know, the Peter Valentine report is confidential. It has not been released. In fact, this motion is calling for its release. I wonder how the Democrats came to have a copy of the Peter Valentine report. Unfortunately, I was too slow to move that Senator Kernot table the document from which she was quoting yesterday, but I was able to do so with Senator Woodley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, Senator Kernot was quoting from quite a thick document; it was not just the three pages from which Senator Woodley was quoting and which he tabled as a result of my motion in the Senate yesterday. The Senate may be aware that this morning I gave notice that, on the next day of sitting, I will move a motion requiring Senator Kernot to table the Peter Valentine report which she appeared to have in her hand yesterday. I ask Senator Coulter: how has a confidential report that has not been publicly released ended up in the hands of the Australian Democrats?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could be excused for agreeing with me that this simply shows that the Australian Democrats are part of the mates network, part of the Labor Party, part of the left wing group that is currently running Australia. It would seem that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, or someone in his department, has made a copy of the Peter Valentine report available to the Australian Democrats. Maybe that is not true. Maybe Senator Woodley will indicate to me where he got it from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem that if it is a confidential report, and one that has not been released, someone has some explaining to do as to where that came from. As far as I am aware, the only people who would have a copy of that report are Mr Peter Valentine and Senator Faulkner and his department. If the Democrats have a copy of the report, it can have come from only one of three places: from Mr Valentine, from Senator Faulkner or from his department. In any event, it would be outrageous if any of those three leaked a copy of a confidential report to the government to one particular political party while ignoring the other political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My notice of motion, which hopefully will be debated on the next day of sitting, requires Senator Faulkner to explain why he or his department or Mr Valentine gave a copy of that report to the Australian Democrats and not to us. It also calls upon the minister to share his largesse equally by making a copy of that report available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the amendment that I propose moving, the coalition is happy enough for the Senate to agree that Hinchinbrook Island should be protected. There has never been any doubt about that. Perhaps of all of us in the chamber, I know Hinchinbrook Island the best. A year or so ago I was fortunate enough to be able to take a houseboat through the Hinchinbrook channel. It is a quite magnificent area. Certainly it is an area that must be protected. I do not think anyone would hesitate with that proposition at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I insist that all Australians be given the opportunity of experiencing the beauty and emotion of that magnificent area. We will never do that if we lock away those very beautiful areas of Australia. We agree that it is a beautiful area and that it needs protection. We have always been a political party that believes in protection of the natural environment. Our record on the environment is second to none. We have only to mention Fraser Island, which Liberal governments were instrumental in protecting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with the first part of the motion. The second part of the motion calls upon Senator Faulkner to release a copy of the report and some other documents, and we agree with that. I have given a notice of motion myself to require it. I do not know why the Democrats are bringing this motion on. Between Monday, when they first gave notice of the motion, and today, when it is being debated, they somehow seem to have been given a copy of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of comments on the documents that were tabled by Senator Woodley yesterday as a result of my motion. It would appear that Mr Valentine is suggesting that the whole boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park or the wet tropics area should be amended. That is an interesting development. I wonder whether the minister is intending to do that and whether, if he does, he will get the consent of the Queensland Labor government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Senate might recall that when the boundaries of the wet tropics World Heritage area were set some years ago the Commonwealth government completely ignored the Queensland government and insisted on those boundaries in direct opposition to it. As I have always said, I do not think anyone objected to World Heritage listing of the wet tropics rainforest, but it should have been done cooperatively and in consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government is now going to change the boundaries, I wonder whether the minister will get the agreement of the Goss Labor government or whether he will ram it through. I understand that the minister, who is from the Left of the Labor Party, and the Goss right wing Labor government do not get on very well. So it will be interesting to see whether the current federal Labor government treats the current Queensland Labor government with the same disdain as the previous federal Labor government treated the previous non-Labor state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summary of the report from Professor Valentine mentions the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook area. As I said, I know them only too well. Anyone who has been there would understand the absolute beauty and value of that area. Mr Valentine then lists 15 impacts of the Oyster Point development on the World Heritage values. As I said in the Senate yesterday, it is quite interesting that his report seems to say that there are 15 very direct impacts whereas the Loder and Bayly report that the Queensland government commissioned seems to say that there are nine only very possible impacts and that none of them are particularly significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate yesterday, Senator Reynolds went to some lengths to give the background of Professor Valentine's qualifications. I am sure the fact that Senator Reynolds's husband works with Professor Valentine has nothing do with it. I also know Professor Valentine; I meet him when I am at James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Reynolds is suggesting that the Loder and Bayly people are not qualified. I do not want to sing the praises of any particular group, but I have taken the trouble to get some details of the Loder and Bayly Consulting Group. It is a very professional and well-recognised consulting group in this area. Some of its clients include the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the federal Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Gold Coast City Council, the Melbourne zoo, the Noosa Shire Council, the Wet Tropics Management Authority and the Urban Land Authority of Victoria. There is a page-long list of its clients. So, obviously, many people think it is very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loder and Bayly has done some major indicative projects. I will mention just a couple of them. The wet tropics recreation strategy is one. The Mary River visitors action plan&mdash;the Mary River is part of Kakadu National Park, and the plan has had wide acceptance&mdash;is also one of the projects that Loder and Bayly was involved in. I do not want to delay the Senate by going through its long background at length. It is obviously very professional and well respected in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of yesterday's debate, Senator Woodley claimed that he had been threatened by Mr Williams. He was lucky enough to get one of the people in the press gallery to run his story; I think it appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. According to Senator Woodley, it is in black and white that Mr Williams has threatened him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Parer and others on this side challenged Senator Woodley to give us the details of the threat that had been made. We pointed out to Senator Woodley that there are certain protections of this parliament for parliamentarians who have been threatened. I have not heard from Senator Woodley since. I again say to him, `You should either tell us where Mr Williams threatened you and give us the evidence or you should publicly apologise to him.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that Senator Woodley has had quite a bit of correspondence and contact with Mr Williams. Mr Williams has exposed him in the past for the inaccuracies that he has been mouthing to the press. Mr Williams has criticised Senator Woodley quite severely for coming into the cowards castle under parliamentary protection and telling untruths about him. He has invited Senator Woodley to speak outside the parliament. I do not think he has done that yet, although I understand that one of his colleagues did. As I understand it, she has been sued and will have the opportunity of showing whether she and Senator Woodley are right or whether Mr Williams is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again invite Senator Woodley to let us have details of the threats made against him. I understand that Senator Woodley has written to Mr Williams a number of times. I wonder whether in any of Senator Woodley's correspondence to Mr Williams he at any stage put on record and in writing the details of the threat Mr Williams made against him or any complaints about the threat that Mr Williams may have made against him, or whether Senator Woodley has mentioned it in any of his correspondence to Mr Williams by referring to the threats that he has made. I also wonder whether Senator Woodley has invited Mr Williams to meet with him. If that is the case, I wonder whether that is the action of a parliamentarian who has been threatened by the man with whom he then seeks to have meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it seems that if Senator Woodley is to retain any credibility at all in this matter he must put up his evidence on just what the threat was by Mr Williams. Mr Williams has pointed out publicly that Senator Woodley went around saying the Mission Beach tourism authority was unanimously opposed to the Oyster Point development. Mr Williams quite rightly points out that, following Senator Woodley's claims, the Mission Beach tourism authority actually paid for advertisements to be put in a paper denying its opposition to the Port Hinchinbrook development. Again, that simply indicates that Senator Woodley comes in here and says anything he likes without any regard for the truth, so much so that the parties he quotes actually have to put in paid advertisements to refute some of the rubbish that he has said about this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley has also roundly criticised Mr Williams about Hamilton Island. I have never met Mr Williams. I am not here to defend him. But, again, I understand Mr Williams, in correspondence to Senator Woodley, quite accurately pointed out the efforts that Mr Williams made to ensure that all creditors of the Hamilton Island project were looked after. I have not heard Senator Woodley correct his statement and apologise to Mr Williams in relation to those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley says that Mr Williams threatened a Mr Arthur Bull of Cardwell. I think he said that in the paper or he mentioned it in this parliament. I am informed that Mr Bull and Mr Williams have had conversations and that Mr Bull has admitted to Mr Williams that he should not have made his statements and has actually apologised to Mr Williams in connection with that matter. Senator Woodley has also made some wild accusations about the permits Mr Williams sought&mdash;accusations that simply do not bear any reference at all to the facts of the matter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, Senator Woodley will have some time at the end of this debate to respond. I await eagerly his answers to those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I will briefly refer to a couple of the matters raised by Senator Reynolds. She says that she has not read the Loder and Bayly report. Neither have I in any detail; I have not had a copy of it. It is a report commissioned by the Queensland government. The Queensland government was obviously quite happy with the Loder and Bayly report and it approved this development subject to environmental conditions. Again, I am not familiar with those environmental conditions. But I would assume that the Queensland government is a responsible government and one which can weigh up the tourist values, the jobs that will be created in this project and, at the same time, have an understanding and an appreciation of the sensitive environmental area that is the Hinchinbrook Island and the Hinchinbrook Channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only assume that the Queensland Labor government&mdash;Mr Goss's government&mdash;was responsible in its attitude to this, and I am prepared to accept that it was. I am prepared to accept that the Loder and Bayly report was relevant. I do not quite know what place the Commonwealth has in this. I have a copy of an advice from the Attorney-General to the federal government back in 1991, indicating that the Hinchinbrook Channel is outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government and is, in fact, within the sole jurisdiction of the Queensland government. As I say, that is an opinion from the Commonwealth Attorney-General to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. So I again wonder what Senator Faulkner is doing in this, unless, as I have suggested before, it is simply part of the Labor Party indulging in its factional brawls and the left wing trying to pay back the Goss government for getting rid of the left wing president of the Labor Party in Queensland, and the left wing of the party and its mates in the Australian Democrats calling them to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Tip Byrne, the mayor of the local shire council&mdash;the Cardwell Shire Council&mdash;is a lovely fellow and a good North Queenslander. He is a member of the Labor Party, but still a good man who does a good job in the Cardwell shire. I understand that, with some qualifications and conditions that the shire has imposed, it is pretty happy with the project. In the Senate yesterday, Senator Parer referred to a meeting in a hall in the small seaside town of Cardwell which over 1,000 people attended&mdash;something pretty unusual these days&mdash;to demonstrate their support for this particular proposal. I think that the Cardwell Chamber of Commerce wrote to all senators from Queensland correcting the mistakes that Senator Woodley and Senator Kernot have been guilty of and urging support from the Cardwell people for this particular project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arranging some informal times, we were allowing for Senator MacGibbon to speak. He has had to return to Brisbane and will not be able to speak here, so I have actually taken a bit of his time. In conclusion, the local authority seems to be in favour of it, the Queensland government seems to be in favour of it and certainly the people of the area are in favour of it. This is an area of very high unemployment and certainly, as a North Queenslander, I can say that we need the jobs&mdash;not only the jobs of construction but the jobs that the development itself will create in time to come. I think that everybody, except, if I might say, the loony Left down here in Canberra, is in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying&mdash;and never have said&mdash;that that development should go ahead willy-nilly. Mr Williams has approvals already and, if he wanted to, he could start building tomorrow and ignore the rest of us; but he does not want to. He has asked for a new approval on a more sensitive development. I have always said&mdash;and certainly the coalition says&mdash;that there must be the most stringent environmental conditions imposed upon that development but, subject to those stringent environmental conditions, the development should go ahead for the jobs, for the export dollars and for the business activity and tourist dollars it will create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Queensland government has looked at it fully and has imposed the sensible environmental conditions. On that basis, one would think that the proposal should proceed. As far as the motion that we are debating today is concerned, as I indicated before, I will move my amendment and, subject to that amendment, the coalition will be supporting Senator Woodley's motion. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Senator Ian Macdonald's amendment is to substantially change paragraph (a) of Senator Woodley's motion so as to remove any reference to Mr Gough Whitlam. That is not an amendment that I would be minded to support. Gough Whitlam was in Townsville on Friday 16 September to open the new offices of the North Queensland Conservation Council. I am aware of the comments that he made in relation to World Heritage in a general sense, and the Oyster Point development in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a person who was well qualified to speak about World Heritage matters, it is certainly Gough Whitlam. He is a former ambassador to UNESCO. He led many Australian delegations at meetings of the World Heritage Bureau and also the World Heritage Committee. During his time at UNESCO, the wet tropics in Queensland, Kakadu stage 2 and the New South Wales rainforests were inscribed on the World Heritage List. Turning to what Mr Whitlam is reported to have said, I am indebted to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> for reporting this. Mr Whitlam said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that while he did not have all the information surrounding the area and the Oyster Point tourist development proposed, he had `no doubt' the World Heritage wilderness of Hinchinbrook Island should be protected and maintained as a World Heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA>He is also reported as saying that the government had to act very carefully in reaching any decision affecting this area. As I have said time and again, when asked either in this chamber or in public about my role as the federal environment minister, I take very seriously my responsibilities in relation to ensuring the protection of World Heritage values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be useful in this debate to briefly outline the process that has been undertaken to date to ensure that proper consideration is given to ensuring the protection of the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook area and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage listing. In June my department provided to the Queensland Department of the Coordinator-General a submission in relation to the proposal. My department engaged Dr Peter Valentine of the James Cook University in North Queensland to undertake an investigation of the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel and its environs and the possible effect and impact on those values of the proposed development at Oyster Point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was sent to the Hon. Molly Robson, the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage, for her comment. Considerable discussions have also been held between my portfolio and the relevant Queensland departments about the conclusions of the Valentine report. I am now in receipt of a long and detailed letter from Ms Robson to which is attached a draft of the deed of agreement between the state of Queensland, Cardwell Properties Pty Ltd and the Shire of Cardwell. I have asked my department for detailed advice on those documents. I expect to receive that advice shortly and provide a response to the Queensland government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the process that has been undertaken has meant that there is maximum opportunity for both the state and the federal governments to look at the complexities of these issues. I stress to the Senate that the issues involved are complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (c) of Senator Woodley's notice of motion goes to the issue of the public release of the Valentine report. Turning to this issue in a general sense, I have indicated that the Queensland government's draft deed of agreement and the Valentine report and their release were the subject of a question to me, I think yesterday, in question time from Senator Kernot. I cannot add very much to what I said to Senator Kernot during question time yesterday. The draft deed of agreement is a Queensland government document and therefore its release is properly a matter for the Queensland government. I did indicate that this was a matter that I was willing to take up with Ms Robson, and I will do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in the interests of full public disclosure that it is appropriate in these circumstances to release the Valentine report. Given the nature of the consultations that the government has had with Queensland on this matter, I think it appropriate that I consult with Ms Robson before that occurs. Therefore I certainly cannot agree to release the document now&mdash;and I use the words of Senator Woodley's motion&mdash;prior to making a decision on the development. Let us be clear about this. It is not up to me to make a decision on the  development. This is an important point for Senator Woodley to understand. The involvement in relation to my responsibilities and powers as the federal minister for the environment is to ensure that there is not an impact on the World Heritage values of this area and that those World Heritage values are protected. So I cannot accept that aspect of the final part of Senator Woodley's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that the motion be amended by deleting the words in paragraph (c) `prior to the minister making a decision on the development' and substituting the following words `after consultation with the Queensland government'. I have provided copies of the amendment to the Deputy Clerk for circulation. I think that is a more appropriate and accurate reflection of my responsibilities in relation to this development. I stress that it is not a matter for decision in that sense or approval of the development for Commonwealth authorities. In response to Senator Macdonald's claim that I have released the Valentine report to Senator Kernot, that is not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to pick up on the points that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has just made and a point that Senator Ian Macdonald was also dealing with. I have in my possession only the three pages of the report which I tabled yesterday. I do not know how they came into my possession&mdash;they were off the back of a truck, as they say&mdash;and, as far as I am aware, that is all that Senator Kernot has in her possession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, Senator Macdonald's motion earlier today, calling for us to table that report, is asking for an impossibility. We do not have it. As I say, we have only those three pages, which he now also has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up on a very general but very important point. What we are dealing with, not only in this debate but in so many debates in relation to environmental protection, is a difference in world view, a difference in paradigm. We have Senator Macdonald and people of his view on the one hand and people like me on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, there are those who see the environment as something out there other than self, something to be exploited for profit. On the other hand, there are those with a view similar to many indigenous people, including our own Aboriginal people&mdash;people who see the environment as part of self, as part of something to which they belong and which therefore has a right to exist for its own sake and which has a need for protection. We see it as something of which we are a part rather than being apart from and therefore able to exploit. Because of that fundamental difference it is very difficult to argue with people like Senator Macdonald because we are coming from different points of view&mdash;and I think Senator Macdonald would be the first to admit that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to expand briefly on my point of view. Several years ago, Dr Stephen Boyden of the Australian National University, who has worked at CRES for a number of years, published a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The biological history of western civilisation</EMPHASIS> in which he developed the theme that for most of human history, for some 400,000 generations, we lived in small groups as gatherers and hunters and we lived in a natural environment. It is only very recently that a small proportion of us have lived in an industrialised and urbanised society. He draws from that the conclusion that most of us are fundamentally genetically adapted to living in a natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds examples of this type of thinking in ordinary, everyday expressions. How often does one hear when people go away on a holiday, `We are getting away from it all'? We need to get away from something. We need to go back to our more human roots which are, quite literally, rooted in a natural environment. Because of those who would exploit that natural environment and build these mega tourist resorts it would not be possible to get away from it all because the `all' would be everywhere. One could never escape from it and one would therefore be diminished as a human being; one would be less than human. That is the fundamental difference in the view being put by Senator Ian Macdonald and those on that side and the view being put by the Democrats and those who would protect these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for these areas to remain as places to which humans can go and experience nature on nature's terms and not be surrounded by thousands of people, which makes that experience quite impossible. Not only that, but if one picks up the theme of intergenerational equity&mdash;that is, the idea of equity between generations in addition to equity within generations&mdash;then it is very important for this generation to ensure that future generations can also experience nature on its own terms and that there are wild places to which our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren can go. If we take those opportunities away, they will be less than human. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, if I understood Senator Ian Macdonald correctly, he was saying that this is an area that has not been developed like many of the other areas in this stretch of the Queensland coast. From that I interpreted him to say, `Why should this not also be developed in this way?' The very reason why it should not be developed in this way is that those other areas have their mega hotels, their casinos and that type of experience. Let us keep wilderness areas where people can experience wilderness. That is very important. It is also very important for later generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hinchinbrook is such an area. Hinchinbrook Island and the channel have been protected as a World Heritage area. It is one which has been clearly recognised as a place where one can have a wilderness experience. Populations have been limited there. It has not been well policed, but it is simply impossible to continue to protect that sort of experience if there are these very large hotels. I make the plea that it is at that level that we are going to continue to have these sorts of debates. It is for that sort of reason that Hinchinbrook needs to be protected. It is for that reason that the Democrats have gone in so hard on this issue. It is for that reason that we put up this motion. We support it most strongly. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DEPARTURE TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill together with the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994 implements the Government's decision announced in the 1994 Budget to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for Customs, Immigration and Quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitor visas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of these services has been calculated as being $27 per departing passenger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to achieving cost recovery for these services, it was also the Government's desire that there be a more effective way of collecting the charge. The old system under departure tax involved purchasing a tax stamp, affixing that to the ticket and then having the stamp cancelled by a Customs officer as the person passed through Customs on the way out of the country. This process added to the red tape that passengers had to go through at what is often a stressful time anyway. The Government is committed to achieving further improvements to Australia's already efficient passenger processing procedures and the report of the Review of the Australian Customs Service&mdash;the Conroy report&mdash;gave strong endorsement to the Customs' Service's direction in this respect. The removal of the process I've just mentioned is a step towards realisation of the vision for airports of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why the Government also decided to seek the agreement of the airlines to collect the Passenger Movement Charge. While the Government is aware that it is common practice around the world for airlines to be required by Governments to collect taxes, fees and charges&mdash;70% of countries world wide have airlines collecting some sort of charge&mdash;the Government chose rather to work with the airlines, in recognition of the importance of the travel and tourism industry to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also gave the airlines a commitment to meet reasonable costs of establishing and running the system. Those discussions are underway at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost recovery initiative is proposed to be achieved by utilising the existing legislative mechanism for departure tax to both levy and collect the passenger movement charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill imposes the passenger movement charge whilst the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994 outlines the  mechanism for the collection of the charge pending resolution of negotiations with airlines.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Reynolds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your Committee's report titled: Report on Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues which was tabled in the Senate on 28 October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I support the majority of the recommendations made in the Committee's report. States and Territories have been consulted about this response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My specific comments on each of the recommendations are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1. The Committee is encouraged by the consultations to date between the OFLC and the industry over regulation proposals. The Committee recommends that a code of practice for distributors of video and computer games be developed and that all distributors be signatories to the code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The OFLC has developed a regulatory system which provides for classification guidelines, official markings, consumer advice and application procedures. The regulatory system will have a statutory basis consistent with the existing framework of censorship laws. It is continuing discussions with industry. The system was approved by Ministers on 18 February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2. The Committee notes that the enforcement of a regulatory regime will be under State and Territory laws. The Committee recommends that the consideration by Ministers of enforcement measures ensures that breaches of regulations must attract prosecution and the imposition of penalties that are sufficiently severe so as to act as a realistic deterrent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: This is a matter for State and Territory Ministers. The Committee's concerns have been drawn to the attention of Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3. The Committee accepts the classification proposals G-0 to 8 years of age, G8-8 to 14 years of age and M-15 to 17 years of age and recommends that the Government supports the adoption of these categories at the meeting of Federal, State and Territory Censorship Ministers in November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Censorship Ministers agreed to these classifications at their meeting on 4 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4. The Committee is concerned that the level of technology involved with the use of video and computer games means that many parents do not necessarily have the competency to ensure adequate parental guidance. Therefore the Committee recommends that material of an `R' equivalent category to be refused classification. The Committee recommends that if an `X' equivalent classification is considered it should not be adopted for video and computer games material. The Committee also recommends that entertainment centres operating coin-operated games should be restricted to offering the G and G8 categories only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The issue of which computer game classification categories will be permitted, and the circumstances in which they may be made available, is a matter for each State or Territory government. Each State and Territory has the capacity to decide under its censorship enforcement laws which classification categories may be sold, hired, exhibited or offered for use in its jurisdiction. At their meeting on 4 November 1993 Censorship Ministers asked the Chief Censor to consult with the public about the proposed computer games classification guidelines. The consultation process is documented in the January 1994 report issued by the Chief Censor: `Report on: Public Submissions on Draft Computer Games Classification Guidelines'. Several changes were made to the guidelines as a result of the consultation. These were agreed to by the Ministers on 18 February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that meeting Ministers also wished that their divergence of views about whether the `R' or `X' categories for computer games ought to be permitted be recorded. After further consideration, some Ministers, who initially supported those categories, reported that their governments no longer supported the `R' or `X' classifications for computer games. Accordingly, the interim computer games classification scheme set out in the A.C.T. Classification of Publications Ordinance, 1983 has been amended to remove the `R' and `X' categories for computer games. Similarly, the Commonwealth Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994 does not permit `R' and `X' computer games to be classified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5. The Committee recommends that an MA classification be introduced for video and computer games found to be unsuitable for viewing by persons under 15 years of age. Games in this classification can only be sold, hired, delivered or exhibited to persons under the age of 15 years if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. The Committee also recommends that the availability of MA material must be conditional on a statutory requirement to provide proof of age at the point of sale or hire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Ministers agreed to an `MA' classification for computer games that restricts such games to persons 15 years and over. However, some jurisdictions have now indicated that they will permit access to such games by persons under the age of 15 years if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian, as recommended by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6. Having regard to the extra sensory intensity involved in the playing of interactive games and the implications of long-term effects on users, the Committee recommends that stricter criteria for classification than those applying to equivalent film and video classifications be set by censorship authorities. The criteria, once established, should be made known to prospective applicants for classification, and the standard of application of the criteria must be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Censorship Ministers agreed that classification guidelines for computer games should be stricter than for other media (see 4 November and 18 February press releases). The draft guidelines were exposed to the public and the industry for comment, amended in the light of those comments, and have been endorsed by Ministers. They have been revised, and endorsed by Ministers, in the light of the decision of all jurisdictions not to permit `R' or `X' classified games to be available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7. The Committee supports the efforts of the Office of Film and Literature Classification to conduct research into the effects of video and computer games as an entertainment form as well as their impact on community standards. The Committee recognises the importance of this research and recommends that appropriate levels of funding be provided to the Office to ensure it can properly assess the influence of this evolving technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Censorship Ministers recognise the importance of research in this area. A jointly funded research project into several aspects of computer games is being developed for Ministers to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8. The Committee commends the proposals of governments to establish and adopt uniform classification legislation for video and computer games. The Committee recommends that a high priority be accorded to achieving that goal and that censorship authorities maintain a monitoring role on the relevance of the legislation in a rapidly growing and changing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Responses to earlier recommendations set out some of the steps already in progress that address this recommendation. Censorship Ministers are in agreement that a cooperative national approach is essential. Also, as you would be aware, the Ministers have a keen interest in the effective operation of the Commonwealth, State and Territory censorship system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9. The Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that both the Film Classification (Censorship) Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review be restructured and expanded to ensure that they have more comprehensive community representation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that, before appointments are made to either Board, the Attorney-General consult with State and Territory Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Government will continue to ensure that membership of both Boards appropriately reflects the community's interests. The resource implications of the additional functions of the Censorship Board will have to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent advertisements in the national press for vacancies on the Censorship Board drew approximately 700 applications from the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already indicated to my State and Territory colleagues that I shall consult, including by representation on selection panels interviewing for vacancies, with them before making appointments to both Boards. This has already been the case with recent appointments and is provided for in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10. The Committee also recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that a community committee be established, representing major interest groups such as parents, teachers, churches, academics, women, youth and aboriginal and ethnic representatives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that the committee would be asked to consider:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any decisions of the Film Censorship Board in relation to the release of a film or video with an MA or R rating about which the Board was not unanimous; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any decision of the Review Board to vary a Board decision to refuse to release, or release a film or video with a recommended R or MA rating at a lower classification, than recommended by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that the Review Board be required to take the community committee's recommendations into account in its deliberations, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) that the Attorney-General be required to make a determination on any decision of the Review Board to release a film or video at a lower classification than approved by the unanimous decision of the Board, and be required to take account of the community committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Censorship Ministers collectively supervise the national classification system and in some cases have retained the right to overturn individual decisions with which they disagree. Members of both Boards are appointed to represent community views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendation for an on-going public consultation program has already commenced. This consultation process takes the form of special screenings of classified, but as yet unreleased, films to groups of people assembled by a market research recruitment agency. An independent market research consultant supervises the completion of a questionnaire and leads a discussion aimed at comparing the issues of concern, the range of intensity of concern about those issues, the recommended age, and appropriate consumer advice with those considered by the Censorship Board when making the classification decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on Films, Videos and Computer Games commissioned by the OFLC has been completed and copies have been provided to the Committee. Further surveys and research flowing from the results of that survey are planned or underway. These include another joint exercise with the OFLC and the ABA and additional research being jointly funded by the Commonwealth and participating States and Territories. Accordingly, the additional processes recommended by the Committee are considered unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11. The Committee recommends that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Censorship Ministers review the length of tenure of members of the Boards;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the current Chief Censor be the only ex officio  member of the restructured Film Censorship Board;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the current position of Chief Censor be re-styled as the Chief Executive Officer of the OFLC; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there be new positions of Chief Censor and Deputy Chief Censor of the Film Censorship Board, to be appointed from the community representatives of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Law Reform Commission's recommendations regarding tenure have largely been adopted. The maximum term of any appointment is to be 5 years and the maximum period of service 7 years. The three other parts of the recommendation, and the support of the Northern Territory for the last part in particular, have been noted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12. The Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the terminology of the guidelines, especially in relation to the Refused category, be revised and clarified to limit as far as possible scope for varying interpretation in relation to material of a sexual or violent nature;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the OFLC's guidelines be amended for video release to ensure that higher standards are applied to material permitted on video than equivalent categories of film for cinema release;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the various regulatory bodies co-ordinate their activities to establish and maintain definitions which will ensure that there is uniform interpretation of terms and expressions used in their respective guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The classification guidelines cannot and should not be drafted to include every possible nuance of film expression. They are not exhaustive, they are intended to be flexible enough to cope with changes in community standards over a period of time and to allow for unique films to be assessed on their merits and not solely on a predetermined list of proscribed elements. Equally, the Censorship Ministers have expressed their views to both the Censorship and Review Boards that violent and sexually violent material should be dealt with more strictly. In accordance with Ministers' wishes, they are already highly prescriptive in the restricted and refused categories. The guidelines shared by the Boards recognise the Ministers' and community concern in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation that video releases be dealt with more strictly contradicts current policy which sets the film and video criteria at identical thresholds. There are persuasive arguments that the system should continue in its present uniform form to promote community understanding of, and confidence in, the classification process, and to provide business certainty on a national basis.The present policy also includes the proposition that the provision of classification advice about films and videos to the community should be as clear and concise as possible so that parents, in particular, can choose entertainment for themselves and those in their care. The classification system also gives notice to those with more delicate sensibilities that this material is inappropriate for them. Accordingly, the second part of the recommendation is also not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third part of the recommendation deals with the prerogative of the Censorship Board and the Review Board, while working from the same guidelines endorsed by Censorship Ministers, to be able to interpret the guidelines in different ways according to their respective perception of a film. Both Boards work within statutory and administrative criteria. Within that criteria, members of both Boards are entitled to apply their interpretation of those criteria as they see them. Accordingly, the third part of the recommendation is also not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 13. The Committee recommends that the Censorship Ministers give favourable consideration not only to the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that standing be widened before the Film and Literature Board of Review but that it also should be widened before the courts in relation to the decisions of the Film and Literature Board of Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: While the full breadth of the Law Reform Commission's approach and the Committee's proposed appeal to a Court is not supported, there is support for a more generous arrangement than exists at the moment in most State and Territory legislation. That approach includes standing to be given to the Attorney-General, the applicant, a distributor and a person aggrieved. Also, the Attorney-General is to be required to appeal if a request is made by the Censorship Minister of a State or Territory.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Chynoweth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 24 June 1994 providing the Committee's report on The Proposal for Pay Parking in the Parliamentary Zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted the Committee's recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"that Parliamentary approval, as required under Section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, not be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the Parliamentary Zone", and;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"that the National Capital Planning Authority, in consultation with other relevant departments, investigate alternative means by which additional funds could be raised to offset the cost of the Restorations and Replacement Program of National Assets".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the Disallowance motion on the National Land (Parking) Ordinance 1994 and National Land (Parking) (Consequential Amendments) Ordinance 1994 by Senator Margaret Reid, a statement was made to Senate on Tuesday 23 August 1994. In my statement, I indicated that other considerations made it critical for both Ordinances to pass into law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also undertook not to proceed with the present proposal to introduce pay parking the Parliamentary Zone, under the powers of the Ordinances. I also indicated that the Government will consider alternative proposals for pay parking in the Zone in response to a number of Parliamentary Committee Reports over a number of years and in relation to strategies being adopted for surrounding areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of pay parking in the Parliamentary Zone was viewed by the Committee solely as a revenue measure whereas its introduction should be seen in the context of implementing a number of Government policies. The Government endorses a reduction in the use of private transport and encourages the use of public transport through such policies as the National Greenhouse Response Strategy and the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. At the United Nations Earth Summit in 1992, Australia and 86 other countries became signatories to the Climate Change Convention, which has an international target of stabilising gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the NCPA investigate alternative fund raising measures to offset the cost of its Restoration and Replacement Program for Commonwealth Assets. In the course of developing the pay parking proposal, the NCPA investigated a number of alternative or additional fund raising measures. These included land rent from Government owned office buildings including the Treasury and Administrative Buildings and East and West Blocks. This was rejected because it would necessitate additional funding from Treasury to enable the relevant Government Departments to pay the rent. Similarly, photographic and film rights, concessions for commercial activities and fees for permits to use National Land were considered administratively expensive for potentially little or at best unreliable returns. Retaining revenue from diplomatic leases would not be budget neutral since these funds currently go directly into consolidated revenue. None of these alternatives proved to be as reliable or predictable a source of income as pay parking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the implementation of pay parking in the Zone the NCPA will be unable to generate the $4.3m to offset funding for the Restoration and Replacement Program. This will mean that the four year Program will fall short of necessary requirements. To maintain the Commonwealth's assets in the National Capital, the NCPA will need a longer term strategy to fund such works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be taking this matter further through the Budgetary process.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"ASYLUM, BORDER CONTROL AND DETENTION"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs consider certain anomalies in the text of the Migration Reform Act 1992, as identified by the Committee and outlined at paragraphs 3.139, 3.140, 3.150 and 3.151 and 3.155 of this report, and overcome these anomalies before the commencement of the Migration Reform Act 1992 on 1 September 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agree in part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.139 proposes legislative amendment to ensure the availability of "questioning detention" during immigration clearance. This issue has already been considered in the review of the Migration Reform Act 1992 (MRA) initiated by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and is covered in the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (MLAA) at section 52(d).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.140 proposes legislative amendment to ensure that a person in immigration clearance need not remain with the same clearance officer. This concern is also addressed in the MLAA in section 52, paragraphs (c) and (d).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative amendment is also proposed in paragraph 3.150, to make it clear when a review of a decision to refuse a bridging visa is "finally determined". The Government considers that no amendment is necessary on this point, as section 4(12) of the Migration Act 1958 ("the Act") defines when an application is finally determined, namely, when a decision is no longer subject to any form of review, or when the period during which such a review could be instituted has ended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to paragraph 3.151, the Government considers that people who bypass immigration clearance should generally be eligible to apply for a bridging visa, and to seek review of a decision to refuse that application. One element taken into consideration is that persons who have bypassed immigration clearance are likely to include people who may have been in the community for many years  and have developed strong ties with Australian citizens or permanent residents. It is therefore appropriate that there be a facility to allow them to make an application for the grant of a bridging visa. Such an application would not, of itself, mean that the person would be granted the visa. An exception will be made in the case of people who bypass immigration clearance but who come to the notice of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA) within 45 days. They will be eligible to apply for a bridging visa only in the circumstances discussed under Recommendations 11 and 12.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.155, like Recommendations 4-6, relates to judicial review. The recommendations themselves raise complex issues requiring careful consideration. The  Government has determined that these recommendations will be the subject of consideration by an Interdepartmental Committee comprising the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Attorney-General's and Prime Minister and Cabinet, in the light of experience after the MRA comes into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that as soon as possible, the Government provide to the Committee for examination the draft regulations which will accompany the Migration Reform Act 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agree in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not practical to provide the Committee with the draft MRA regulations prior to their creation. The process of their creation involves extensive restructuring of the regulations to ensure incorporation of totally new terminology and concepts. Any delays would affect training and other matters, putting at risk effective implementation of the MRA on 1 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations need to be put to the Executive Council and will be gazetted, and hence publicly available, very soon thereafter. If the Joint Standing Committee identifies a problem, the Government would consider subsequent amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that the decision on whether to include unauthorised boat arrivals within the prescribed class of detention non-citizens, conferring on them eligibility to be released from detention with a bridging visa, be a decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs personally which is not to be delegated. In addition, the mechanism for including such prescribed non-citizens within the prescribed class of detention non-citizens be structured carefully so as to allow for appropriate exercise of Ministerial discretion without inviting challenges for judicial review of such discretion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to be granted a bridging visa under the Migration Act as it will be from 1 September 1994, a non-citizen will need either to be immigration cleared or to be in a prescribed class of persons (in either case the person is referred to as an "eligible non-citizen"). An eligible non-citizen will then generally need to apply for a bridging visa and be assessed against the relevant criteria for the grant of that bridging visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear whether the Committee intended, in Recommendation 3, to refer only to the first process&mdash;that is, to the making of regulations relating to prescribed classes of persons&mdash;or whether it intended to refer also to the subsequent process of application and assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative amendment is not necessary to give effect to this recommendation, insofar as it relates to the making of regulations relating to prescribed classes of persons. The regulation-making power is effectively non-compellable and involves the Minister acting personally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To introduce a non-compellable, non-delegable power in relation to decisions made pursuant to any such regulation will require an amendment to the Act. This will be done in respect of changes to be enacted in partial response to Recommendation 11.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Recommendation accords with current Government policy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Recommendation accords with present practice. The Department and the RRT are conscious of the importance of processing applications for refugee status in a fair and expeditious manner. Both organisations are also conscious of the need to ensure that the decision making process provides applicants with the opportunity to present their claims and that these are fully and sensitively considered. Under the Act, the RRT is specifically charged with providing a review mechanism that is ". . . fair, just, economical, informal and quick".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrangements have been in place for some time to ensure that refugee applications from unauthorised border claimants and other persons in detention are given precedence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address a few brief remarks to the government response to what is a very important report. This is a very pleasing response from the government to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The report contains 19 recommendations. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has given unqualified acceptance to 13 of those recommendations. He has accepted two more which have been agreed to in part and one other which has been agreed to in principle. So 16 out of 19 recommendations have been agreed to, three with qualifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three important recommendations&mdash;recommendations Nos 4, 5 and 6&mdash;are still under consideration. Recommendation No. 4&mdash;the legal recommendation&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Judiciary Act 1903</EMPHASIS> be amended to specify that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Reform Act 1992</EMPHASIS> and its predecessors are enactments to which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Judiciary Act 1903</EMPHASIS> do not apply.</PARA>
<PARA>In recommendation No. 5 the committee recommended that a leave to apply provision should be inserted in respect of persons seeking to take actions in the Federal Court before the court can deal with them. Recommendation 6 deals with amendments to the Migration Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when the interdepartmental committee gives consideration to those three recommendations, it will take into account the experiences of the Federal Court since this report was brought down in March of this year. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration has expressed concerns in this report about the high usage that people are making of the Federal Court after they have been through what has been proved to be very fair processes of administrative decisions for asylum seekers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have people entering this country illegally who are given the opportunity of applying for refugee status through the administrative process. If they are rejected at that initial stage, they then have the opportunity of applying for a review of that decision through the Refugee Review Tribunal. If they fail with those two areas to which they have access, they then take their case into the judiciary. There is no other country in the world which allows both an administrative processing system and a judicial processing system to take place. That is one of the reasons the committee made the recommendations along the lines that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the interdepartmental committee of the Department of Immigration, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Attorney-General's Department looks very seriously at this situation. Otherwise, as the committee said in its report, if we are going to end up with two very expensive systems of processing asylum seekers in this country, it is the people of Australia who will ultimately suffer. There are people suffering because of what I have publicly termed to be an abuse of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, those people who have had their applications and their appeals for refugee status in this country refused take their case through to the Federal Court, but some people have been through to the state Supreme Courts, and there are a couple of cases that have gone to the High Court. While those cases are going on, those people remain in detention. In some cases they have children who also remain in detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of children, I certainly hope that when the IDC is considering the committee's recommendations Nos 4, 5 and 6 it takes into account the experiences of two very young Chinese girls, asylum seekers, who have received a deal of publicity in recent months. Lin Yan is aged 13 and Lin Jing is aged nine. They had made application for refugee status in this country. That application was rejected because they did not qualify under the criteria of assessment that we use. They made application to apply for a review of that refusal. But before the Refugee Review Tribunal concluded its deliberations on their appeal, their application was withdrawn. It left the two children without any status whatsoever in Australia and liable for immediate deportation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did not act to deport them immediately. He waited until their uncle's application to the Refugee Review Tribunal had been assessed. It was rejected and then the whole family became liable for deportation. Deportation orders were issued to the whole family. I think there were nine members in total, including the uncle and his wife, a brother of the wife, a brother of the husband and, of course, the two little girls, and there were some other children as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers acting on behalf of the two girls and the uncles made application to the Federal Court in Canberra&mdash;not in Perth or Port Hedland, which is part of that state&mdash;for a stay of those deportation orders. The application was refused and the children were still liable for deportation. The very next day, lawyers again made application to the Federal Court&mdash;this time in Sydney&mdash;for a stay of the deportation orders. The judge in Sydney referred the application back to Canberra where again two days later the deportation orders were upheld. The lawyers immediately went to the Full Court of the Federal Court in Sydney with three judges sitting and made further application, and the Full Court upheld the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family had been through four separate applications for asylum and review in this country and the applications had been rejected on all occasions. They were not satisfied with that and they took the case to five judges of the Federal Court on three separate occasions. The girls were in the news again this morning because the court sitting in Sydney suggested that the children should be brought to Sydney because their lawyer is based in Sydney and it is a better place for them to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have publicly called the way these children have been treated child abuse. It is not only child abuse, but also an abuse of their parents. After enormous efforts by the department, the parents were located in China and they were to meet the children when they returned to their homeland, but the courts in Australia were used to intervene and the children never actually returned to meet with their parents. It now appears that they are going to be here for a considerable time. Another directions hearing is going to take place. I do not want to comment on the actual court case itself but rather the use of the courts and how the Australian system can be abused and is being abused in my opinion in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only case dealing with boat people in Australia that is going on in the courts. I am informed that there are 151 immigration cases before the Federal Court and almost 100 of them are applications from boat people. I suggest that most of those applications are from people who have already been through the administrative system. In the government's response to the committee report the minister states that there has been a dramatic improvement in the processing of boat people in this country. That system is not accepted by some. I made a  tongue-in-cheek suggestion earlier this year that if we were to send boats up to China to bring the people in ourselves, they probably would not be satisfied with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very costly exercise which is paid for not by the government but by the Australian taxpayers. I am continually and ever increasingly getting requests from constituents to bring an end to this abuse of the system. In saying that it is an abuse, I do recognise that there are some lawyers and some refugee support groups who truly believe in what they are doing and believe they are doing it for the best reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some individuals and organisations that have involved themselves in the boat people debate whose ethics I question. Three weeks ago I revealed, without naming it again, that one refugee organisation in our home state is being used as a front for the National Civic Council. I think the use of refugee organisations in the past has unfortunately brought the reputation of many dedicated people into question, if not disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This costly exercise has gone on too long. I hope the interdepartmental committee mentioned in the government's response comes up with some ways of amending the ADJR Act and the Judiciary Act to ensure that these abuses are not allowed to continue and that the suffering of people in detention and the suffering of the Australian taxpayers is put an end to once and for all, whilst retaining a very fair and just asylum seeking processing system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter which I raised yesterday by way of a question to Senator Schacht. I want to take issue with some of the things that he presented to the Senate in his answer. Before doing so, I make it quite plain to you, Mr President, and to Senator Schacht that I am in no way suggesting that he misled the Senate or gave an answer that was not in accordance with all the facts. He received the information from another source and presented it, I believe, totally in good faith. In a sense, however, it does not deal with the issue that I raised. More information needs to be placed before the Senate for the situation to be understood fully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the science olympiads&mdash;physics, chemistry and biology&mdash;and the opportunity of Australian students to participate in them. My question yesterday&mdash;and the issue that I raised previously&mdash;relates to the government's failure to continue to support the olympiads and my concern that it is not in Australia's best interests to neglect to encourage students to participate in science and engineering. It is crucial to the future of this country that this should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the history of the olympiads as far as Australia is concerned. The ASO was founded in Australia in 1988. For the first three years, those who were encouraging students to participate managed to raise the funds locally through the goodwill of universities. The students also raised funds. This enabled Australia to take part. That was fairly unsatisfactory in that the students spent much of their time raising money rather than preparing themselves for the olympiad activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, Mr Dawkins, as a result of representations made to him, recognised that the olympiads were an important opportunity for students with aptitude in the areas of physics, chemistry, et cetera. He said that $100,000 per annum would be made available for five years for each of physics and chemistry, and responsibility for the money was passed to the management committee. From then on, participation in the international olympiads took place with the assistance of this government money which Mr Dawkins made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my question yesterday, the Australian science olympiads directors have been advised that this money will not be renewed. That was the point that I was making. There are three directors of the Australian science olympiads, one in each area of physics, chemistry and biology, who run the teams for Australia. They are doing this in their own time. They have neither the time nor the expertise to go fundraising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently it has been suggested by the government that the ASO should raise money to support student participation. That would be fine if it had any form of secretariat that had the expertise to do it. I remind honourable senators that this organisation started from people putting in this effort on a totally voluntary basis to give Australian students the opportunity to participate. This is not an organisation with the structure, mechanisms and bureaucracy to give members the expertise and time to go out raising money for these activities. I suggest that it is in the interest of Australia that young people participate in these olympiads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, though, secured the 1995 International Physics Olympiad to take place in Australia, and the federal government promised $300,000 to assist in the funding. Yesterday, in answer to my question Senator Schacht referred to this money and said that the government was surprised that I had suggested funds were being withdrawn when in fact this money was being given for the purpose of the Physics Olympiad in 1995. It is true, indeed, that the money has been given to stage the International Physics Olympiad in 1995, but there has been no funding towards Australia's participation in it. That is the point I am attempting to get across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the $300,000 is presenting the organisers with somewhat of a problem in that the fairly tight budget was drawn up to an amount of $480,000. Intensive fundraising efforts have added another $10,000 but, thanks to the assistance of the University of Canberra, it has been decided that the $310,000 will be made do to enable us to stage the International Physics Olympiad of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a pretty bare bones activity. It will mean that the participants coming here will see nothing of Australia&mdash;only the inside of the university. It is a shame that the bright students coming here from all around the world will not have much of an opportunity to see anything of Australia other than to participate in the event at the University of Canberra. Thankfully, that university is enabling it to go ahead even with the small budget that is available for the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Schacht if it were true that the government was no longer providing money for the Australian Physics Olympiad. The answer in fact is that the government is not providing money for that purpose, but we do acknowledge that it is providing funds to enable the event to be staged. It is quite different. As one of the people involved in it said to me, it is like saying that in the year 2000 there will be no funds for the AIS; all the money available will go to the city of Sydney towards staging the Olympic Games. That, effectively, is what is being said: you will get money to assist the staging of the event but you will not get any money to assist the Australian students who ought to be participating in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason it is very disappointing, indeed. If that is the end of the matter, there will be no Australian participation thereafter in physics, chemistry or the areas students ought to be encouraged to participate in. It looks as though Australia will not be able to take part in other events in the future. How will we get our students to the Chemistry Olympiad in China if there is no support for this event? There are others in the future. I think there is a Chemistry Olympiad proposed to be staged in Australia later this decade but there is no commitment to assist Australian students prepare for events in the future. There will be no Australian physics team going to Norway, shall we say, in 1996 if this situation persists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We give money for sporting events. We give money for the development of sportsmen, and I totally support that because I think there are very good reasons for our doing that. But I think it is a matter of great regret that we appear to be penny-pinching when it comes to supporting students who have the sort of intellectual capacity in the areas Australia needs if we are going to be competitive with the world and develop exports and markets in areas that take some activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that science and engineering are the keys to success and growth. If we look at the number of people employed in these disciplines in the countries around us, in the countries we are trying to compete with, it absolutely stands out that the number of people who have graduated with science or engineering is closely linked to the success of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to have another look at this, to look at what is being done to provide assistance for Australian students to participate. I urge the government not to confuse the money that is being given next year to hold the physics event in this country with the ongoing opportunity for young people to take part in it. Senator Schacht's answer to the question I raised yesterday is not adequate, and I ask him to go back to the minister he represents, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) with a view to looking at it in the way I have now spelled out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed float of the NRMA has the potential to create the largest number of shareholders of any Australian company&mdash;some 1.8 million people. Many&mdash;probably most&mdash;of these people have never held shares before. The NRMA has budgeted to spend more than $30 million promoting the case for the conversion of the association from a mutual society into a company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, the NRMA has failed to fully apprise its members of the reasons not to convert from a mutual society to a company. These may include pressure on the NRMA to dispose of loss making services such as its road service, its legal services, its free maps and its consumer advocacy. The shareholders will demand bigger and better returns and services that do not make money would then be threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More worrying for NRMA members&mdash;including me&mdash;is that the biggest winner from the NRMA float is not the members but the federal Treasury. Those directors of the NRMA who promote the float claim that the float is the best way to distribute the $2.2 billion worth of reserves that the NRMA has built up over two generations of service. While the NRMA prospectus makes a few mentions of tax treatment, it fails to mention that the likely total tax bill, when all the dust settles, will be about $600 million to $700 million, with the vast bulk of that being paid by the new shareholders. The NRMA has not given its members the overall picture of what happens to the NRMA pre and post a float from a taxation point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like later to table advice I received from David Parker, a chartered accountant of many years standing and also a former director of the NRMA. His advice is compelling reading and highlights the massive tax disadvantage that the NRMA will face if it moves from a mutual society structure to a company. In the process of losing its mutual society status, the NRMA will lose $375 million worth of tax credits from its franking account; it will lose $375 million off the tax assessable assets base for capital gains purposes; it will have to bring $480 million of pre-1985 assets into the capital gains tax net; and its income becomes tax assessable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little wonder that all the NRMA competitors in the insurance industry have warmly welcomed the NRMA float. They know it will make the NRMA less competitive in insurance and less able to use its reserves to provide rebates on insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Parker concludes that the NRMA board has not sufficiently explored more tax neutral alternatives to floating the society. We have to ask ourselves: why is that? I am not necessarily saying that the answers to the following questions are in the affirmative, but it is certainly possible. Was it because the current ruling faction of the NRMA saw moving to a company structure as the only means of maintaining control of the association and delaying board elections, which would probably have delivered a board majority to the Motorists Action Group? As a floated company, the majority of the board could move to remove minority directors, even if they were democratically elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the board not agree to a `no' case being put to members? That is a very important question. Surely, with $30 million being spent on the `yes' case, the cost of putting a `no' case would pale into insignificance. Was it because the board thought or knew that the `no' case was compelling and that the advantages of maintaining a tax exempt mutual society structure more than outweighed the marginal advantages of moving to a company structure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the federal government? The silence of the ASC is deafening. Is it because the deputy chair of the ASC also happens to be vice-president of the NRMA? Hundreds of thousands of Australians could be about to become shareholders with little or no concept of what that means in terms of responsibilities, the changed responsibilities of directors to maximise returns rather than maximise services, their own personal tax, and even the impact on their social security benefits because of treatment of investment incomes under the DSS income tests. I seek leave to table the document I spoke of earlier. I did deliver a copy of it to the minister and to the shadow minister 1 1/2 hours ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise an issue that is of very great concern to the part of Queensland in which I live&mdash;and, I might say, fish&mdash;and that is the move by the Queensland government to ban all angling in national parks. That, in itself, does not seem to be such a major move, but it does have the effect of really closing off from amateur angling all the saltwater mangrove creeks from Cape Upstart, just south of Ayr and Home Hill, right up to the Hinchinbrook Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That move by the Queensland government has brought a pall of doom across those people in North Queensland who are interested in recreational fishing. Last Saturday morning, in my own town of Ayr, there was a demonstration of about 300 boats and trailers driving through the main street. In Townsville during the week a meeting attracted over 2,000 fishermen, an extremely large meeting in this day and age when people are all too reluctant to get out of their armchairs and from in front of their television sets to make some mark on government policies. That meeting of over 2,000 fishermen was unanimous in opposing the proposal by the Queensland government to shut these creeks and this area off to amateur angling. The Labor member for Thuringowa, Mr Ken McElligott, showed a lot of courage in attending the meeting and, as I understand media reports, agreeing with the anglers that these closures of creeks should not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most anglers are responsible people. They do not take more fish than they need; in fact, if they are anything like me, they very seldom have the opportunity of taking fish. We just like going out into the creeks and fishing. It is only ever a bonus if we catch a fish or two. Having that right taken away from us is a major assault on the way of life of many North Queenslanders, not to mention the impact it would have on tourism, because many people come from all over Australia to partake in recreational fishing in the creeks of Upstart Bay, Cleveland Bay, Bowling Green Bay and up to Hinchinbrook Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All anglers would agree, if fish stocks are being attacked and depleted, to some reasonable management such as closing off a couple of creeks for longer periods or closing off all creeks for shorter periods. I do not think anyone objects to proper management of the fish stock in these creeks, but to absolutely ban fishing in all of them is an outrageous action. As well as affecting the tourist industry and the families that like recreational fishing, the proposal would also put many tackle shops in the towns of Home Hill, Ayr, Townsville, Thuringowa and Ingham out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People's livelihoods that are invested in those businesses would disappear overnight. Many employees of those shops, which are in many instances quite big establishments, would simply find themselves without a job and so the unemployment queue would again be added to in the Townsville region&mdash;and it is already quite large. These sorts of actions by the Queensland government would add to the unemployment problem in the Townsville region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been disappointed that, apart from Mr McElligott, the Labor member for Thuringowa, the other elected representatives in the Townsville region have not raised their voices. These include Mr Geoff Smith, the member for Townsville; Mr Ken Davies, the member for Mundingburra; and Senator Reynolds and Mr Lindsay, in the federal parliament, who all represent people in that area. I have been disappointed that they have not joined the opposition to this move by the Queensland government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking tonight because I cannot attend a meeting protesting this move which is being held at the Burdekin theatre in my home town. I would very much have liked to have been at that protest meeting, but unfortunately I am required to be in parliament. I am paid to do that; so it is appropriate that I should be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not being able to be part of the protest meeting in my home town, I want to make my own protest in this chamber. I ask the Queensland government to seriously consider the implications of its move. No-one objects to sensible management of the environment or of the fish stock, but simply closing these creeks in a blanket way is not the way to do it. I would hope that the enormous protests that have developed in the region will make the Queensland government realise it has made the wrong decision. It is my hope that it will see the sense of the arguments put by those opposing the action and amend the proposals that it currently has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to place on the record tonight a follow-up to something that I placed on the record a couple of weeks ago&mdash;a letter by Pamela Bornhorst, formerly of the ABC<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> 7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, protesting against an article written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> by Peter Charlton. This letter gives her an opportunity to record her side of an argument; so I will read it. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On June 2, 1994 . . . Senator Christabel Chamarette, tabled a document in the Australian Senate relating to my axing as presenter of the Queensland edition of the ABC's 7.30 Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been assumed and reported that I was either the author of this document or in some way collaborated in its preparation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the record, I wish to state that I was not the author nor was I involved with it in any way. I had never sighted it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, at no stage prior to the tabling of this document in the Federal Parliament was I contacted to determine whether I supported its contents or the tabling of it in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, there was considerable public disquiet over my removal from the 7.30 Report. In the weeks following, a group of supporters (including some members of the Friends of the ABC) gathered some 7000 signatures calling for my re-instatement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For my part, in January this year I told a meeting of my supporters that I was personally devastated by the episode, given my 16 year association with the ABC, but I wanted to put it behind me and get on with my life and my new job in talk back radio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I believed then as I do now that there was political interference and I remain deeply concerned about the treatment handed out to those within the ABC who supported me, particularly the five journalists from the Queensland edition of the 7.30 Report who supported me in writing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the Workskill Australia-New England competition. Honourable senators might wonder why I would want to speak about this tonight in this chamber. I happen to be the patron of the Workskill Australia-New England competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workskill has done a great deal of good to help the apprentices in that area achieve better skills and higher standards. The 180 competitors who last weekend came from all over New England and the north-west&mdash;Moree, Glen Innes, Armidale, Coonabarabran, Inverell&mdash;really strived to win. But all the people who attended the competition were winners because those who enter Workskill all improve their skills and achieve a lot more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were competitions in bricklaying, cabinet-making, cooking, autobody repair, automechanics, carpentry, electrics, hairdressing, metal fabrication, office secretarial support, plant and transport, mechanics, plumbing, turning, vehicle painting and welding. There were also two demonstration categories&mdash;art design and autoelectrical. All of them, as I say, were winners because they all competed and did a great job. I congratulate the winners. I also congratulate all those who put themselves on the line to strive to improve their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Turnbull, who is really an ambassador at large for the Workskill foundation, spoke at the presentation dinner and gave a very good recitation of what it is all about. There is a volunteer network of something like 1,500 people to promote higher standards of performance in vocational training and to give recognition to young workers and their teachers and trainers. That has all happened over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been achieved with the support of governments, industry, trade unions and the TAFE system. Over 25,000 young people around Australia have taken up the challenge to test their skills against the very high standards that are set in the Workskill competitions. Some of the people in the turning competition start off with just one piece of steel and a blueprint and, within eight hours, they have just about gone through every discipline that is required to be performed in the turning field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst everyone aims for high performance in vocational training, the end result which I believe we all want to achieve is world standard performance in our work force. That is what this is about. It is great to see the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) at the table tonight because he knows the worth of competing. The foundation has been working to match industry developments by including modern technology categories in the competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at our international performance we see that the team of 35 young people that Australia sent to the 1993 Workskill Olympics in Taipei was one of the most competent teams to represent Australia. It finished 10th out of 24 countries, winning four bronze medals and 13 diplomas, which are rewarded for high standard performances. It was a great performance from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that 167 Australians have competed and have won 37 medals in international competitions since 1985. Whilst Australia's results over five Workskill Olympic competitions have shown that we are the best performing English-speaking nation in terms of both medals won and the percentages of the diplomas awarded, we see a need&mdash;and I am sure the minister would agree with this&mdash;to improve this performance at the international level. Just listen to the countries which have been at the top of the competition in the last few years: Japan, Korea and Taiwan. They are the ones that have led the way. If we are to compete in Asia, we have to have a work force in Australia that is competent, competitive and always striving for excellence and that little bit extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new pilot program has been started by the foundation this year. The program is known as CLIP, which is the continuous learning and improvement program. It is hoped that it will help&mdash;and it will help, I am quite sure&mdash;those regional winners to prepare for the national finals and to develop skills to assist them to succeed in their careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the young people I met who competed last weekend were absolutely ecstatic that they had competed. The winners were a little more ecstatic, I suppose, than the ones who did not win, but they all felt very excited that they had competed and tested their own skills standards against everyone else. The wealth of this nation will be based on our ability to compete on the world stage. I am quite sure Workskill will be right at the forefront of that to make sure we have young apprentices going on through the field to become our leaders for tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Workskill is about striving for excellence, recognition of excellence and producing future leaders of industry. We all stand up in this place, laud our Commonwealth Games gold medallists&mdash;I do, as does everyone else in this place&mdash;and give them due recognition. But I think it is time that we started to give due recognition to young people who strive for excellence in whatever field. That is why I am here tonight speaking on behalf of those people who competed and those others associated with them. Our quality of labour must be internationally competitive. The only way we can do that is by making sure that we have people competing at the highest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1995, which is only a year away, the winners of the Australian competition will form the Australian team, with the Australian colours, and compete in Lyon in France. Hopefully, we will have some gold medal winners. If our competitors do come back with some gold, silver or bronze medals, I think they should be acclaimed in this place, just as we acclaim any of our sports people who do well when they compete. We should think of giving the Order of Australia, which we often give to our sporting stars, to some of these people who attain the highest world standards at the international Olympics. It the same competition and it is just as intense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great spectator sport. Anyone who has been to a Workskill final or the Workskill Olympics, which were held in Australia a few years ago, will know how interesting the sport is. That is how I became so interested in it and became its patron in the north of New South Wales. When I was the patron of the Workskill Olympics in Sydney, I saw the amount of help and support that other countries give their competitors. I think we have to start doing the same thing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate all those who competed. I congratulate the employers who gave their apprentices and other young people time off to train and practise for the competition. I wish the winners well at the national finals. I congratulate the sponsors who put so much time, effort and money into helping the competition. I particularly single out Helen Tickle from the Tamworth TAFE; Roslyn Dewick, the coordinator of the New England</PARA>
<PARA>Workskill; John Morris, the chairman; and Joanne Thomas, the secretary. They all played a very big part. If we can all have a little bit of a think about recognising our young people&mdash;whether they be sports people or people who strive for excellence in their profession&mdash;then I think Australia will be a better place. </PARA>
