<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in the Australian Federal Parliament</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Even as Communism is disintegrating elsewhere around the globe, Vietnam's 72 million people still suffer under communist totalitarianism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Although there have been some moves towards economic development by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) in recent years to only marginally alleviate depressed economic conditions, they have not led towards political liberalisation or improved human rights records. People are imprisoned or kept under house-arrest without charge or trial for the peaceful expression of their beliefs and alternative points of view. There continue to be severe restrictions on freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, association and movement, workers' rights and the right to vote for a government of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The major religions in Vietnam have been subjected to the surrounding, isolating, oppressing, terrorising, penetrating and interfering policies of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the supreme political body of the GOSRV. In particular, the GOSRV has attempted, since 1981, to disband and forcibly replace the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), a legitimate Buddhist Congregation representing the spiritual life of 80% of the Vietnamese population, with the State-controlled Vietnamese Buddhist Church (VBC) because the UBCV refuses to serve as a puppet organisation of the GOSRV for political purposes. Religious leaders are targets of political control, ill-treated, imprisoned or under house-arrest. Among them are Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the UBCV. Most Venerable Thich Quang Do; Venerables Thich Tri Sieu, Thich Tue Si, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Tinh, Thich Hai Tang, Thich Khong Tanh. Recently, Assistant Archbishop Nguyen Van Thuan has not been allowed to return to Vietnam after his overseas tour. Other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience include Dr Nguyen Dan Que, a member of Amnesty International; Dr Doan Viet Hoat, a former Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the Van Hanh University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such treatments represent a systematic violation of international standard of human rights solemnly recognised in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and in the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners respectfully request the Senate to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Urge the GOSRV to take action to facilitate the release of all religious leaders, political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, in particular those mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Urge the GOSRV to allow religions including the UBCV to independently practise and organise their religious and related affairs in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Call on the Australian government to press the GOSRV to ensure the respect of human rights and civil rights in Vietnam, and to take these factors into account in its consideration of the provision of economic assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the Federal Court to enforce lawful orders made by Parliament, and to allow the Court to determine claims that disclosure of information to Parliament would contravene the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The catalyst for the bill is the conflict between the Senate print media committee and the Treasurer over the committee's request for Foreign Investment Review Board documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I have not put this legislation forward just to solve an immediate problem. That Parliament lacks a satisfactory mechanism to enforce its own orders has been obvious for years, particularly where it is the government which refuses to comply. There has been no satisfactory way of resolving Government claims that disclosure of information is not in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Coalition tried to obtain evidence about the Whitlam Government's attempt to raise loans through Tirath Khemlani and others, it failed. When Labor tried to obtain documents revealing the Fraser Government's failure to tackle bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance, it also failed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is drafted to allow Parliament to ask the courts to enforce any lawful order made against any person or organisation. But the principal aim is to deal with disputes which arise when Parliament orders a government to disclose information, and the government refuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to suggest that Parliament is powerless in the face of non-compliance of this kind. It is just that its powers, while extensive, are widely seen as inappropriate for use in such a situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we know, section 7 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 gives each House the power to impose a fine or prison sentence for an offence against it. This is Parliament's sanction of last resort, but it is clearly undesirable when a public servant is caught between two orders&mdash;Parliament's order to divulge information, and a minister's instruction not to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case now before the Senate print media committee, the House of Representatives would no doubt protect the Treasurer from any action taken against him by the Senate. This would leave the Senate with the option of taking action against the public servant at the helm of the Foreign Investment Review Board, who is acting on the Treasurer's instructions. That is clearly unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, I believe there is a general view in the community that it is the role of the courts, and not the Parliament, to impose prison sentences or fines. Although there is a school of thought that the courts have no role in determining disputes of a political nature, to leave matters as they are would continue the decades-long uncertainty over the relative powers of Parliament. It is time this matter was resolved, and the only realistic way of doing so is by resort to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate also has the option of taking political action to get its way. That could include filibustering, or even blocking key bills in protest. But again, I do not believe it is appropriate for Parliament to engage in obstruction to enforce accountability. This is a more civilised alternative which will avoid further erosion of Parliament's standing, and we should use it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts a new section 11A into the Parliamentary Privileges Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new section makes it an offence not to comply with a lawful order of a House or committee and requires the courts to make orders to remedy the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, failure to comply with a lawful order to produce documents would be an offence, and the courts would order that the documents be produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an offence is proved, the standard penalties in the Act apply unless the offence has been committed by a public servant acting under a minister's instructions. In that case, the public servant is not convicted of an offence, and no penalty is imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be cases where someone other than a minister (perhaps a departmental secretary or company executive) instructs an employee not to comply with an order of Parliament. It could be argued that the employee should be protected from prosecution in those cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However in such a case, the secretary or executive would lack the protection of parliamentary privilege&mdash;unlike the minister&mdash;and would then be open to enforcement action instead of the employee. I have therefore decided to limit the protection of this provision to public servants acting under a minister's instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested to me that there should be no penalty for non-compliance with an order of Parliament, and that penalties should only be imposed for contempt of court, in the event that a court orders compliance but the defendant still refuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern about this proposal is that it makes non-compliance with an order of Parliament cost-free. Anyone could refuse a committee's request for information in the secure knowledge that the relevant House would have to take them to court to get it, and that they would be immune from any penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the courts' power to order compliance provides scope for leniency in imposing penalties, for example by suspending a fine or prison term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill explicitly recognises that a defence against Parliament's order to produce documents or give evidence is that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In considering such a claim, the court must hear the evidence or view the document in camera. Disclosure of those proceedings would be an offence unless subsequently ordered by the court, but Parliament would be free to hear the same evidence or receive the documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this provision is to require executive claims of public interest immunity to be determined by the courts. The bill makes it clear that determining such a claim is a balancing act, which requires any prejudice to the public interest which disclosure might cause to be weighed against the public interest in the free conduct of inquiries by Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the significance of the matters at stake, a case under this legislation would be heard in the Federal Court, with any appeal going to the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the bill prevents Parliament from having a bet each way. Once a prosecution has been commenced, Parliament would be prevented from imposing its own penalties using section 7 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a prosecution under this bill can only be made by a person authorised by a resolution of the House whose order&mdash;or whose committee's order&mdash;has not been complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"> This bill is a constructive attempt to break a deadlock which has existed for far too long. It is a step towards more open government, but one which allows government claims of public interest immunity to be heard and determined impartially.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has given no clear indication of its position on this bill. I would point out to them that failure to support it would look distinctly hypocritical, given the vehement attacks on me for leaving open the use of the penalty provisions of the Act to obtain Foreign Investment Review Board documents from the Board's Executive Member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides an alternative process which would allow the Federal Court to resolve the dispute without any threat of a penalty against any public servant. It depoliticises the competing claims of the committee and the Treasurer as to whether disclosure is in the public interest. If it doesn't become law, then we will be thrown back on the inappropriate provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a fair and reasonable alternative, and I commend it to the Senate.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently there has been a great deal of discussion about the role of the Senate and what powers it should or should not have. There is general consensus that one of the Senate's key roles&mdash;perhaps its primary role&mdash;is to enforce accountability; to act as an assertive house of review. I do not believe that the Senate will be properly able to carry out that role while it lacks the power to enforce its orders that information be divulged. This bill provides that power. However, it qualifies that power by explicitly recognising that disclosure may not be in the public interest, and it depoliticises the public interest test by placing it in the hands of the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect that the Senate might use its imprisonment power to obtain government documents has been very controversial.

<PARA>The Senate has no quarrel with the requirement to obtain a forecast and acquire all the necessary information in relation to an IFR flight or a VFR flight at night. That is not in dispute at all. But the imposition of this requirement to get all the information that is required for an instrument flight, for a VFR flight, which is a flight made under visual flight rules, is wrong and is a classic example of over-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem and the Senate would have no problem with the general proposition that pilots should always be encouraged to get this information. The problem with the resolution is that it requires, under pain of a very high penalty, that the pilot acquires this information, otherwise the flight is illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are occasions in Australia where it is inconvenient to get this information and proceeding without the information in no way would prejudice the safe conduct of the flight. I stress that if the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that pilots in command should get, wherever possible, all this information, particularly in relation to weather forecasting, and if they requested them to submit a flight plan, we would wholeheartedly support that move. It is the element of compulsion on this narrow point that is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To penalise someone with a fine of $2,500 for this alleged breach of the rules is quite disproportionate. It is as nonsensical as the current legislative position that a pilot can be fined $5,000 for running out of fuel. No pilot would run out of fuel as a conscious act. I have been flying for 30 years and if I have ever run out of fuel I have been facing circumstances that were beyond my anticipation at the time I departed on that flight. I would have either met extreme weather conditions, there would have been something mechanically wrong with the fuel supply system, or the operation of the engine occasioned a much higher than normal fuel burn. This reflects the current philosophy of the Civil Aviation Authority. There is this great punitive air; there is no consultation; there is no seeking to counsel and advise people who breach rules; there is just the imposition of massive fines. It creates the wrong atmosphere in a small community such as the aviation community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that is very wrong about the regulation before us today is that it fails to reflect the policy changes in the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to VFR flights that have been manifested in recent years. The Civil Aviation Authority has campaigned against VFR pilots putting in flight plans. They have talked about the enormous cost of putting a plan in and have discouraged pilots on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that they attribute such a high cost to putting a flight plan in reflects on their administrative processes. A plan should be able to be submitted and processed for a very nominal figure. The machinery is there for it, and if it is used efficiently there should not be figures of $150 and upwards bandied around by the authorities as the cost of filing a plan. It should be a matter of a dollar or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant thing in VFR operations has been the closure of flight service offices all around country Australia. That has made position reporting very difficult. If a VFR pilot is flying around Australia and makes a position report, either that position report will not be acknowledged or the pilot will be reproved or rebuked by the air traffic controller for cluttering up the airspace with unnecessary information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously mentioned in the Senate how pilots often use subterfuges as they cross from one air traffic boundary into another. They will call up for the QNH of the new area and in the process put in a position report saying they are overhead so and so at this time at such and such an altitude, and anticipating their next point at such and such a time. That is never acknowledged by the air traffic controller, but it is on the tape. If the aircraft fails to arrive at its destination, it then becomes possible to check back and get a position fix indirectly through the tape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is very clear. The department does not want to do anything for VFR operations. The law does not require radio below 5,000 feet. It is quite possible to legally fly VFR and make no demand at all on air traffic control procedures or facilities. Therefore, to legislate that we must have information on all the air traffic control procedures and requirements for an area is quite irrelevant. It just does not need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in recent times is an imbalance develop in the Civil Aviation Authority, with all the emphasis on aircraft operating under the instrument flight rules and very little concern for the interests of the pilots operating under VFR. The great majority of flights are in light aircraft in Australia and are made under visual flight rules. Numerically, that is the major part of the traffic in Australian skies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, a number of VFR aircraft have been lost and the authority has been involved in a series of very expensive searches looking for those aircraft. Those searches would have been speeded up a great deal if pilots had been encouraged to file flight plans. That would have refined the area of the search to a considerable degree. The searches would have cost at least $250,000 to $350,000 and upwards for the hire of search aircraft. The authority is now getting very embarrassed about that and is rethinking its policies on VFR operations, but it does not have the courage to admit that it was wrong in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of the authority should be to encourage pilots to file flight plans and to get information wherever possible, but not to make it compulsory. There are a lot of parts of Australia where we can safely fly without a weather forecast. For the major part of the year in most of Australia, for VFR operations operating along the coast or inland, the terrain is very low and flat and the weather systems are very predictable particularly through western New South Wales and western Queensland for months on end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By looking at the weather one can make a very good forecast as to what will happen in the day. If one starts the day in winter in western New South Wales or western Queensland, and there is no ground fog and eight-eighths blue sky one can be reasonably confident, if there is not  a high wind, that one will experience good weather conditions, not only for that day but also probably for some days ahead. One makes that assessment based on judgment and airmanship. I do not see that there is any need to make a forecast mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also harassment for a lot of pilots, particularly in rural areas. Let us take as an example somebody who is on a property 60 miles out of Longreach and who wants to go into Longreach on business. It is mid-winter in Queensland, perfect blue skies and negligible wind: he can safely look at the weather, make that assessment himself, fly into Longreach, do his business and return without getting a forecast. Of course, thousands and thousands of pilots have operated that way. The Civil Aviation Authority cannot show, statistically, any record of accidents or malpractices that have arisen as a result of pilots making their own assessment in the sorts of circumstances about which I am talking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return to VFR operations at the present time. Legally one can fly below 5,000 feet without radio VFR. It is quite anomalous to make the flight illegal unless the pilot is aware of `the airways facilities available on the route and the conditions of the facilities' and `the air traffic control instructions and information relating to the flight'. Quite simply, one can fly where one does not need those facilities at all. So it is wrong to legislate for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until two years ago this situation was dealt with by having an exclusion for aircraft below 1,930 kilograms. That operated very well: such aircraft were excluded from the old regulations of getting weather information and all the rest of it. That basically took in all those VFR light aircraft operations. Interestingly, when the CAA was challenged on this point, it claimed that a range of high performance, twin-engine aircraft have been introduced which could no longer land in small restricted spaces, which was the basis for awarding the original concession against aircraft below 1,930 kilograms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the Civil Aviation Authority to instance any high performance, twin-engine aircraft that has been introduced in the past 20 years. It simply has not happened&mdash;it is a false claim. All those twin-engined aircraft that are on the register in Australia were designed, certified and registered in Australia more than 20 years ago. Their operational history is such that there are no grounds at all for claiming an abuse of the process. What we have had in the past has worked well. There is simply no evidence from the Civil Aviation Authority to warrant this change that is before us. It is the worst sort of over-regulation, it is not necessary and it is harassing the pilot community. My biggest objection to it as a legislator is that the regulation is unenforceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedures for obtaining weather forecasts, getting NOTAMs and filing flight plans are set up now so one can dial in with a touch phone and, through a series of computer codes, access all this information. One then gets a computer generated voice with an American accent giving the weather information, the NOTAMs and all the rest of it. The point is that it is an automatic transfer of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if a pilot flew in from Bourke to Bankstown VFR and a CAA inspector asked him whether he obtained a weather forecast before he made the flight, the pilot could deceive the Civil Aviation Authority by saying, `Yes, I did. I did it automatically on my touch phone and I received the information'. It would be quite impossible for the Civil Aviation Authority to disprove that false claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a legislator, like everyone else in this chamber, I believe that it is very bad practice to pass legislation which is unenforceable. At the end of the day the element of proof that someone did not obtain a flight plan cannot be obtained with the present system that is in place. And, of course, the other thing that the CAA relies on very strongly here is the presumption that weather forecasts are accurate. Weather forecasts are done either on a terminal airfield basis of making a forecast of what might happen through the next 12, 24 hours at the particular airport to which one is going, or they are done on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecasting system does its best, but in no sense is it infallible. Yet the whole basis and justification for this is that somehow or other a blueprint can be obtained from a forecaster, saying with perfect fidelity what is going to happen within the next 12 to 24 hours. That is not true. It is part of good airmanship to be very cautious about the veracity of weather forecasts. I can well remember a situation, maybe 28 years ago, when I was a very inexperienced pilot. I departed from a capital city airport in absolutely perfect weather conditions&mdash;not a cloud in the sky and zero wind. The forecast I had obtained about half an hour before departure showed that there were CAVU conditions obtaining in that area within the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 20 minutes of my departure from that airport I was literally fighting for my life below the cloud base, over the tops of trees, in mountainous terrain. I got into that situation principally because I was inexperienced and young. I got out of it because I was very experienced in that area&mdash;I had done a lot of rock climbing and mountaineering when I was at university and I knew the terrain. But the point is that I believed the forecast that I had got only half an hour or an hour earlier&mdash;a forecast which said there was no significant weather, no cloud, no fog, nothing. I was led in through my inexperience, reinforced by the belief that there was no significant weather in the area. Every pilot has a story like that. It is quite wrong to presume that a forecast is infallible. By all means, people should be encouraged to get a forecast, but they should regard it as a guide to what might happen, not as a certainty of what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we are dealing with here now is the general run down within the Civil Aviation Authority and the lack of operational experience and professional competence within that body. Some time in the future when there is a relevant bill before us I will look at this in some detail. But all of us in the aviation industry are now very concerned by the marked decline in professionalism within that body. A regulation like this would never be put forward by anyone who had any operational experience: it is wrong; it is over-regulation; it is unenforceable; and it carries this quite horrendous fine of $2,500. Quite apart from the fact that that is a lot of money, the incident would go on somebody's record with the department and have to be declared annually when they renegotiated their insurance premiums on their aircraft. They would pay a penalty because they had breached Civil Aviation regulations. It would be quite unjust for someone in the sorts of circumstances I have outlined that apply to VFR operations to carry that stigma on their career. </PARA>

These penalties have been determined and agreed in consultation with the Attorney-General. They are considered appropriate for the level of the offence.

If there is one thing we cannot predict, it is the weather. The unforeseen is an inevitable part of both sailors' and airmen's lives. One way of coping with those circumstances is to have a degree of alertness and awareness in what one is doing at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation reflects the basic doctrine of the department that is at variance with the general basis of laws in Australia that a person is innocent until proved guilty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to reconsider this regulation if it is redrafted in a different form. I am in sympathy with what the authority is trying to do. It is just that it has messed it up in this case. The penalties are too heavy. At the time of the introduction of these punitive charges for breaches of the Civil Aviation Act, I fought this matter in this chamber. I said that it would be abused by some, not all, members of the authority. The operational history of the authority in recent years justifies my worst fears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been numerous abuses of power. Senator Faulkner's words were that very rarely has this power been abused. I have in my files letters from pilots and from lawyers representing pilots around this country relating to incidents where there has been a gross abuse of power by the Civil Aviation Authority. I will give an example of that. There was a flying school operator in Tasmania who hired an aircraft to a pilot. The pilot ran out of fuel and landed on a beach. The owner of the flying school found out about the incident. There was an incoming tide. He flew in beside the aircraft, refuelled the aircraft and both aircraft were successfully flown off the beach. He was then subjected to an invasion or an assault by Civil Aviation Authority officers in the region. They took papers, records and documents from his office and summarily suspended his licence. He had done nothing wrong. Ultimately, they admitted their mistake, but it was a gross abuse of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last piece of legislation which dealt with this provision in the act to allow the authority to summarily suspend pilots' licences before the case against them had been proved was debated at some length in this chamber. We had assurances from the Civil Aviation Authority that the power would not be abused, but I have many letters in my files stating that licences have been suspended summarily. If life, limb and property are at risk, the authority is absolutely justified in doing it, but where there has been a breach of regulations which really does not harm property or person&mdash;no lives are at risk&mdash;it is a gross abuse of power, in my view, to summarily suspend the licence before the court action has taken place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my remarks were interrupted last evening, I was saying that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has claimed in his fiscal framework that the starting point deficit for the 1994 budget is around $13 billion, despite the fact that no other reputable commentator seems to agree with this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the government has neither the intention nor the will to frame a budget this year with an economically responsible bottom line, that is, a deficit figure. The Treasurer has ridiculed the idea of a deficit of $10 billion. He claims that that would wreck the recovery that is under way in the economy. Such a claim does not stand up to any serious scrutiny.

I ask the government whether it argues seriously that the recovery is so weak and delicate that a billion or two dollars left in the private sector rather than being borrowed and spent by the public sector will kill off four per cent economic growth. If it believes that, it really has an obligation to tell us why this recovery is so fragile and balanced on a billion-dollar knife edge of pump priming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be an absolute tragedy if the government were to abort the economic recovery by yet another bout of the fiscal irresponsibility that has marked much of its 11 years in office. It is essential that the government start making a contribution to national savings rather than continuing its reckless policy of dissaving. Every time the government runs a budget deficit, it runs down the nation's savings&mdash;that is, it takes potential savings away from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today the real underlying problem is lack of savings. That leads to a lack of investment, to excessive borrowing from abroad and to a resultant mountain of foreign debt, which is still growing rapidly by something like $1 billion a month as a result of a still burgeoning deficit in our balance of payments on current account. The inevitable outcome of this vicious cycle is a continuation of the boom-bust pattern of previous years with all its tremendously harsh implications for almost all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few facts that the government should have very clearly in mind as it frames the forthcoming budget. Firstly, the need for Australia to substantially lift investment has rarely been so urgent. I find it quite bizarre particularly for the Prime Minister and some of his other ministers to threaten business with an increase in wage rounds and wage demands if it does not get down to doing that. That is the last thing one wants when trying to restore confidence within the private sector to invest. Strong investment and economic growth must be paid for by higher domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Australia's recent savings performance is amongst the worst experienced this century and certainly the worst since the end of World War II. Private and public sector savings declined throughout the 1980s, with a very sharp deterioration in public sector savings in the recession. That must be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To create the jobs Australia needs there has to be, as I have said, a significant lift in net investment. Our investment performance does not compare too badly with other western nations, but it is significantly worse than many of our Asian trading partners and competitors. In that context I must draw attention to the proposals of the Australian Democrats and the Greens in terms of what they think ought to happen in the forthcoming budget. Along with the Labor Party, of course, they are members of Australia's high tax club. If we are to go down that route&mdash;for example, the Democrats are proposing a massive increase of $5 1/2 billion in spending, an increase of $4 1/2-plus billion in business and investment taxes, a Medicare levy rise, a jobs levy or higher income taxes&mdash;that will destroy this fragile recovery that we already have under way. It will do the very opposite of what is required in this country, namely, to lift our savings and investment performance. I urge the government in framing the budget to take full account of those fundamental underlying requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleagues in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). The bill has half a dozen purposes, but I intend to address only the calculation of fringe benefits tax for employer-provided car parking and the provision of a rebate equal to the fringe benefits tax paid by certain non-government schools. But, as I said, the bill contains many other measures. It arises because the government is finally trying to implement some of the tax measures mooted in the last budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the payment of fringe benefits tax for an employer-provided car parking space, in the debate following the budget we on this side of the chamber certainly made several points. We said that it would be hard to administer and that it would be unfair to some employers and some employees compared with others. We pointed out the implications and certain ways to avoid the situation. Colleagues of mine, such as Senator Watson, Senator Short, Senator Kemp and Senator Troeth, pointed this out but, as usual, the government took no notice at the time, so we now have a tax amendment bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, fringe benefits tax is paid on parking when an employer provides car parking at his premises and when those premises, or the entrance to those premises, is within one kilometre of a commercial parking lot. At the time I pointed out that when that parking is fairly close to being within one kilometre there could be certain abuse of it. I termed it abuse at the time, but I do not consider it to be abuse. By changing the entrance to a business parking lot by 20 or 30 metres the entry may be altered from under a kilometre to over a kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the government laughed at that situation, but I know it is happening and, as far as I am concerned, legitimately so, because the siting of an entrance to a car park is up to the persons or companies that own the building. They are things that we pointed out, but the government took no notice whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there is what the government calls a problem with companies using the night rate rather than the day rate car parking charges. As I far as I am concerned, these figures are commercial in that they are what is charged at commercial parking stations. I believe that all 24 hours should be considered in car parking stations. This government believes that car parking charges have been reduced from $16 to $4 in some cases because $4 is the all-night parking rate, and that is what it is intending to legislate around. As I have said, FBT is payable where the employer provides car parking for at least six hours between the hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the government does not accept parking meters as being a commercial parking station. They are certainly not a commercial parking station, but I believe they are a commercial parking lot. Local governments set up parking meters on ground vested in them by state governments. They provide parking inspectors to make sure that cars are not left standing by parking meters with no credit. What is more, there are certain places where a meter can be bought for the whole day. If an employee buys a meter for the whole day and is reimbursed by the employer, that is the figure that should be used and not the figures of a commercial parking station which has far more overheads than a parking meter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parking meter is sited on ground owned by or vested in the local government, money is put in and parking inspectors come and go. Commercial parking stations are bigger businesses with higher costs and larger infrastructures. More people per car are employed in keeping those commercial parking stations going than with a parking meter. I cannot see the rationale behind the government banning the use of a parking meter as being commercial. Perhaps the minister will explain why it is that parking meters can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the unintended consequences of the government's ill-conceived FBT on parking. As I have explained, that is why commercial parking stations are dearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar situation happened with government and non-government schools. We all pointed out on this side of the chamber that it was not totally fair that government schools were treated in one way and non-government schools were treated in a different way. Once again, the government did not take any notice of what was said and went ahead and did what it liked. These are schools run by religious institutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go further and look at hospitals. Government hospitals are not caught in the net of fringe benefits tax on car parking but private hospitals are. I know of some hospitals, hospices and other caring organisations that are run privately, but not necessarily as profit-making organisations. The government should look at relieving them of fringe benefit taxing measures. No doubt this chamber will be looking at that again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government and non-government schools are covered. Then there is the scientific, charitable or public education of adults; the trade unions and registered employee or employer organisations; and the non-profit organisations and societies. In those situations the government is now making sure&mdash;whether it has been done in the past or is being done by this amendment bill&mdash;that fringe benefit tax does not operate. But the government has a long way to go, especially regarding hospitals. We have pointed this out continually and hopefully the government will have something to say about these points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefit tax has been highly criticised by our side, and it is operating as a mishmash. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> there is a good article by Peter Freeman on how judicious spending can keep the FBT bill down. The article centres on meals and whether they are for the sustenance of employees or entertaining clients. I would hate to be an accountant these days trying to work out these situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of how meals can be treated in so many different ways. The article deals with the cost of business meals from 1 April 1994, which is when the new fringe benefit tax becomes law. A meal classed as sustenance of employees is one provided in the workplace as finger food, sandwiches or whatever. If no alcohol is provided&mdash;and if work is continuing in the workplace, I presume that alcohol would not be provided&mdash;the after tax cost will be $67 per $100. If a client is provided with the same meal, the after tax effect of spending $100 will again be $67. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing food for an employee through an in-house dining facility again will cost $67. Sustenance supplied to an employee when travelling will cost $67. But when an in-house dining facility is provided for a client, the after tax cost of the meal will be $100. In other words, there is no upward factor or downward factor. Under the new tax regulations coming in on 1 April this year, any FBT paid by an employer will be a tax deduction. The legislation made sure that all FBT paid worked out at the nominal rate of the taxpayer at the time, which was generally the top rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the figures in the article, one sees that in-house entertainment of an employee works out at $100, so there is no net upward or downward factor. In-house entertainment of a client is $100; external entertainment for a client is again $100. But when travelling and entertaining&mdash;in other words, when an employee who is travelling entertains a client&mdash;the amount goes up to $130. Frankly, I cannot see the difference between entertaining in-house or out of house. If people entertain their spouse when he or she happens to be travelling with them, the amount is $130&mdash;in other words, a $30 uplift. The amount for external entertainment of an employee is $130. This shows how far these fringe benefit tax anomalies have been thrown around. No doubt there will be more amendments in this place in the months ahead to fix these anomalies. I believe this is a total fiasco and the government should be looking at the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the budget that will be announced soon, I would like to make a few comments on what we know about it at this point. As honourable senators may remember, yesterday Senator Gareth Evans refused to rule out the banning of lump sum superannuation payments. In a response to a question from me he gave a non-answer, so I would say that is quite likely to be in the budget. </PARA>

The Greens of Western Australia, who represent the state that provides 25 per cent of Australia's export income, have suggested that the government do away with the diesel fuel rebate&mdash;as if the government is getting that rebate out of its pocket and giving it to industry, farmers or whoever. Past governments have given that rebate for diesel fuel that is used off road&mdash;that is, that which is used on mines and farms mostly.

Before my time in this discussion expires, I will tell the people of Western Australia and anyone else who is listening what the Democrats have in mind. They have in mind increases of $7.8 billion, but of course they did not mention business and personal tax concessions of $2.8 billion. People can see for themselves that the Democrats are advocating a net gain of $5 billion for the government. Those cuts were stolen straight out of Fightback. The Democrats stand for high taxes, driving business people out of business, driving farmers from their farms and of course stopping resource development that is so vital to taking Australian projects off the drawing board and into practical completion and operation. That is what the Democrats are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to lump together the figures suggested by the Greens of Western Australia and the Australian Democrats, we would have a total disaster. All these suggestions of raising more money and spending more may give us a warm inner glow, but the Greens and the Australian Democrats have not told us about what they will do with farmers, miners and their employees. After all, in case anyone does not know, for every job in a mine, four jobs are created in the major city closest to the mine. I would like know what the Greens and the Democrats will do with those people as well as the ones put out of employment in the actual mines themselves. Perhaps when Senator Coulter gets up to speak in this debate he will tell the people of Western Australia exactly what he has in mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza very much. The introduction of the tax incentive rebate for private owners of heritage properties represents a most important initiative for heritage conservation in Australia. I know that the national trust movement and other heritage organisations have lobbied for a long time for the introduction of a scheme such as this. Those people who are living in or who own historic buildings have an onerous responsibility not only for the maintenance of the physical fabric of the building but also to look after those buildings in the hope that they will continue to survive and mean something to succeeding generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these property owners have inherited their property through the family and the property may have been in that family for many generations. But with the upsurge of interest in the conservation movement, many of these owners have also acquired them in recent years as a result of taking a genuine interest in historic buildings. At a time when we do look back and consider our nation's history as we approach the year 2000, there is a growing interest in our heritage. We can only hope that the National Trust and other heritage bodies will benefit from this renewed enthusiasm. Through what one could only describe as a paucity of financial resources, it is not possible for the trust and other bodies to help owners maintain their buildings through the provision of financial help. It is a long overdue reform for tax incentives to be made available for building owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While welcoming this initiative, it is important to realise that not all heritage properties are high value large buildings, such as Como in Victoria or Vaucluse in New South Wales. Many of the heritage buildings which are so important to our sense of nationhood are much smaller and represent the lives of earlier settlers who came to Australia to make a better life for themselves and their families. It is for that reason that the coalition wishes to amend this legislation to make the approved expenditure level $5,000 instead of $10,000.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am thinking in particular of the many small stone and timber cottages dotted throughout Victoria and of the efforts made to save them by dedicated individuals who are prepared to devote time and money to retrieving part of the national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all of these owners would be able to reach the level of the minimum $10,000 expenditure requirement. I ask that all senators support the coalition amendment that the minimum expenditure requirement be reduced to $5,000 in one year. This would mean that certain groups in the community, such as low income earners, would not be disadvantaged in their efforts to restore their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In advocating the introduction of this scheme, I am sure it was never intended that it be elitist in nature, but by reducing the minimum expenditure amount to $5,000 many more property owners would be given the incentive to maintain the property. Much of the maintenance work required in restoring and maintaining old houses, such as the provision of dampcourses, rewiring, reroofing and so on, involves considerably less expenditure than $10,000. Indeed, many owners embark on a small-scale but nevertheless constant attempt to spend a certain proportion of money on their property in order to keep it free from damp and other invaders. But the expenditure may not necessarily reach the $10,000 level, and I am concerned that many property owners would be put off attempting further restoration if it did not reach the $10,000. If we reduced the level to $5,000, a start could be made on conserving our heritage for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment that the coalition has foreshadowed is the one dealing with the recognised heritage register. I know that the National Trust has concerns about this. This legislation proposes that applications for a provisional certificate must be for historic buildings or structures listed on the Commonwealth or state territory registers. The trust and the coalition are concerned that this is a flawed argument. Major discrepancies exist at the state and territory level about the comprehensiveness of the respective lists and, therefore, whether there is a level playing field when it comes to assessing applications. For example, Tasmania does not have state heritage legislation and therefore does not have a state register. Western Australia and the Northern Territory have introduced heritage legislation only in the past few years and therefore their register lists are relatively small. In Western Australia, for example, there are about 230 places on the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that a large percentage of the Commonwealth or state and territory registers are in fact listings of public buildings and many of the listings are duplicated on these registers. The National Trust classified lists are far more substantial and contain a large number of privately owned properties. It is for this reason that the coalition has moved that, for the purposes of the meaning of heritage conservation works, the National Trust classified lists are, until 30 June 1995&mdash;that is, in something like 14 or 15 months time&mdash;deemed to be a recognised heritage register. This would allow the Commonwealth and state territory register lists to be overhauled and advanced to a level where they could form a feasible level for looking at these properties. For those reasons, I join with my colleagues in advocating the adoption of the amendments moved by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very pleased to hear Senator Troeth speaking to that amendment and also indicating that Senator Macdonald is in favour of those amendments because one of the things that the Australian Democrats wishes to address is the cap that is placed on tax deductibility. I hope that in a reciprocal manner the opposition will see fit to support the removal of that cap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments are also directed to the particular portion of the bill that Senator Troeth has just been addressing. I foreshadow an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) which will greatly assist the protection of the natural environment as well as the built environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment will allow donations of land to approved organisations to be fully tax deductible. The tax act currently contains a severe restriction on the donation of gifts of property. It limits eligibility for tax deductibility to land purchased within the previous 12 months. This is a major impediment to the growth of community based initiatives to protect threatened areas of land. It means that those who wish to donate land to organisations such as the Australian Bush Heritage Fund and the Daintree Rainforest Foundation do not receive any incentive whatsoever if they have owned that land for longer than 12 months. I have a press release from Judy Henderson of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund in which she defines the Australian Bush Heritage Fund as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a national conservation organisation which is urging the federal government to support these vital amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to be proposed by the Democrats. The amendments are to enable donors of land to natural heritage conservation organisations to obtain tax deductibility for their donation.</PARA>
<PARA>This part of the amendment is not introducing a new system to the tax act because certain other gift provisions already permit deductions even though that property&mdash;non real estate&mdash;has been owned for longer than 12 months. The amendment proposes a new category of environment organisations to be known as natural heritage conservation organisations. These are groups established to acquire land through purchase, bequest or gift in order to protect that land in perpetuity. The amendment will stimulate the growth of such organisations in Australia, which will in turn see the growth of a community based protected area system. This is very much in line with opposition thinking on this matter. If states are incapable of acquiring lands and protecting them, private individuals may choose to do so, thus providing an additional way in which certain areas can be protected. That is very much in line with the Liberal Party's philosophy of private initiative where governments are incapable or do not have the resources to carry out that sort of function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of bequesting land is well established in the United States&mdash;the home of free enterprise, as we are continually told&mdash;with groups such as the Nature Conservancy Agency in ownership of a large land bank and a multimillion dollar equity base. The amendment establishes a register similar to the Register of Environmental Organisations that was established by the government in 1992 for tax deductibility purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the amendment allows any unused deduction to be carried forward and claimed in future years. This picks up the point that Senator Troeth has just been making. It is important that with these amendments to the tax legislation we do not discourage people on low incomes from making donations simply because they do not get the same tax benefits as people on higher incomes. Under this scheme donors on lower incomes who would not be eligible for the full tax deduction in the year in which the donation is made would be able to pass the unclaimed portion on to future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats acknowledge that this amendment is limited and does not take account of other restrictions in the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, we are using this amendment to target one particular outcome, and that is to achieve the emergence of a community-based protection areas system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that would receive immediate benefit from this amendment is the Daintree. The Daintree is under threat from the subdivision of more than 1,000 blocks, mainly of one hectare. This amendment would encourage the purchase of blocks in that area by the Australian bush heritage fund, or indeed any other suitable and recognised funds that would be established, and the Daintree Rainforest Foundation. The Australian bush heritage fund has already purchased one 8.17 hectare block of fan palms in the marshy Palm Road region. This block is part of a cassowary habitat, the cassowary being an animal that is found only in, and is confined to, that particular part of Australia and the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two amendments that the Democrats are proposing relate to the conservation rebate for the built heritage, and this comes very much into the area that was dealt with in the previous speech. The first amendment would remove the maximum allowable limit, and the second would extend the conservation rebate for the built heritage to the natural heritage as well. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the cap, we find it quite remarkable that in so many other areas the taxation law allows either tax deductibility or rebates without any cap at all. We find it rather surprising that a cap should be applied in this case. People may be eligible for a rebate but only a limited amount will be available. If people are quick off the mark they will get a rebate but if they are not they may miss out altogether, even though their claims are just as legitimate in terms of the purpose for which the money was spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example&mdash;and this has been in the news in the last few days&mdash;is negative gearing, which was introduced by this Labor government. I remind the opposition that last year negative gearing netted the Taxation Office as little as $7 per dwelling in tax take, and in the previous year it actually cost the Taxation Office $120 per dwelling. It should be noted that there are well over one million dwellings being rented throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negative gearing is not limited. The government does not put a cap on negative gearing&mdash;it does not say that the total amount will be $40 million or $50 million. Once we allow that sort of system, it applies to everybody who qualifies. Therefore, we find it quite strange that the government should put a ceiling on the rebate scheme for the built heritage. If the rebate is for a legitimate purpose, as defined within the act, then we believe that it should not be limited in any way at all and that it should be available to all people who qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Australian Heritage Commission is supportive in principle of the idea of making the rebate available for expenditure on rehabilitation work carried out on natural areas listed on the register of the National Estate. I point out that if the government or the opposition are minded to support our amendment in relation to removing the ceiling&mdash;the cap which this legislation puts in place on the rebate scheme&mdash;then there is no concern in respect of extending the scheme to natural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have two sets of amendments&mdash;one which relates to the cap and one which goes to the matter of extending the application of the rebate to the natural environment. If the cap is not removed, we would not be keen to proceed with the second batch of amendments to extend the rebate to the natural environment simply because that would limit the amount of money which would be available for those who would be supporting the built environment. So the two sets of amendments which we would be putting up in this area really go together. But I would urge the opposition to support our amendments on the basis of the general principle that tax deductibility, if allowed, should be generally applicable and rebates, if allowed, should be generally applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not deny rebates for medical expenses to people who come in on 1 August instead of 31 July because the government has set a limit of so many millions of dollars for expenditure on health care. We allow a rebate in relation to health expenses over $1,000 and that rebate is applicable to everybody. So this rebate scheme should also be generally applicable and not limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the National Trust is concerned that the amendment to extend the rebate to natural areas, if successful, would spread too thinly the cap of $2 million for the built heritage program. However, I believe that the amendment seeking to abolish the maximum allowable limit, if successful, would remove its concern as the rebate would operate without an upper limit. We believe that that is precisely how the rebate scheme should operate. I will speak to these amendments when we get to the committee stage of this bill. At this stage I just wanted to outline the general thinking which lies behind them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and to support my colleagues who have spoken before me. I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to talk about the general economic management by the government and the momentous decision which the government is facing in the near future with regard to its budget&mdash;that is, the deficit for the next financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last August, the government budgeted for a deficit of $14 1/2 billion, which is a bit over 3 1/2 per cent of total GDP. It signalled that its plan was to reduce that deficit to one per cent of GDP&mdash;one per cent of the total economy&mdash;or to about $4 1/2 billion by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns out that the government expects the actual deficit this current financial year to be less than the $14.5 billion due to the much higher economic growth which has come through, thank goodness, of around about four per cent rather than the forecast 2 3/4per cent, which was in the budget papers last year. We all welcome the news of the higher economic growth, but we believe that that growth should be used to lower the deficit, reduce the claim by government on savings and make room for private sector investment within the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very vital issue to everyone in Australia, not for the short term but for the next several years. I have said in the chamber several times that we are facing an absolute crisis in investment in Australia. Total business investment has been at absolute record lows for the past 30 years, and plant and equipment investment is at its lowest level for 50 years&mdash;since World War II. Why is this so? Why are people not investing here? They have not been doing so because there has been too much uncertainty over the last several years; there has been a lack of opportunities for people to make profits. I am not just talking about big business: I am talking about government businesses, companies and particularly small business. We must remember that most of the growth in business in Australia in the last several years has been in small business&mdash;very small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this government has accentuated the uncertainty during the period it has been in government by accentuating the boom and bust cycle&mdash;the recession we had to have. We have had much higher interest rates than we needed to have, particularly over this last deep and long recession. Added to that, there has been further uncertainty for the business community with regard to industrial relations legislation and Mabo. Instead of aiming to try to free up the economy and encourage investment&mdash;its rhetoric has been in that direction&mdash;the government's actions have deterred people from investing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the deficit matter in all this? The government's deficit&mdash;how much it spends beyond what it gets in&mdash;matters because it has an impact on the interest rate regime in Australia. Interest rates are already on the move. In the last six weeks, interest rates on 10-year bonds have increased by about 1 1/4 per cent. The futures on bank bills indicate that by December this year, which is not far away, they will also be up by about one per cent. This morning we had news from the USA of further rises in interest rates which are likely to roll through to the Australian interest rate regime. That signifies that the government has to handle the budget very careful. If the government wants to encourage investment and sustain economic growth, we have to reduce the deficit and move towards a surplus as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Australia has a very substantial external debt&mdash;about $170 billion, which is 43 per cent of GDP. Over 10 years ago when this government came to power, the net debt was only about 15 per cent of GDP, so there has been a massive change. The change in external debt means that, on such things as interest rates, we are now far more exposed as a country to international fundamentals. As Max Walsh pointed out last week, if Europe and Japan get into recovery mode and start growing again, from past experience we can expect about a two per cent lift in real interest rates. What can be done about this? The government can reduce the deficit towards the figure&mdash;as my colleague Senator Short and the Business Council has mentioned&mdash;of $8 billion to $10 billion. That is the sort of target we need. The Australian community needs to understand that unless the government aims for such targets, we are back on the rocky road of boom and bust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1984, then Treasurer Keating ridiculed the fiscal doomsayers who pushed for lower deficits and reduced government expenditure. Only two years later he had to proclaim that we were living in a potential banana republic. Over the last 10 years or so we have had a history of very substantial booms and busts. In order to avoid that, we have to take a longer term view of the economy and seriously consider reducing the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If business starts investing, and we all hope that it does, what will happen? Most of the investment, particularly in, say, most plant and equipment&mdash;which, as I said before, is currently at a record low level of about six per cent of GDP&mdash;comes in as imports into the country. As business investment picks up, the import levels will pick up. What will happen then? Because of our large external debt, we will have a problem of balancing our external trade. What tools can the government use to help put the lid on that? Virtually the only tool it has is control of interest rates. That is why it is important to anticipate that outcome now, to reduce the deficit, thereby reducing pressure on interest rates in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with investment we need increased savings in Australia. Savings are at an all time low right now. The FitzGerald report last year pointed out that the biggest culprit behind Australians not saving is the federal government and its expenditure. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Professor Colm Kearney pointed out that public sector investment has also been substantially cut in recent years. The government has cut investment within its sector rather than cut current or operating costs. The answer to all of this is that the government has to seriously look at aiming for a surplus in its budget situation as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) has ranged fairly widely and I thank all honourable senators for their contributions. I will confine my response to some matters that Senator Watson and Senator Short raised. Senator Troeth raised some matters that Senator Watson also raised so, in some respects, I will be dealing with those; likewise with respect to matters raised by Senator Coulter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Gibson's contribution, which was a general economic analysis, he made a comment about the lack of incentive for investment and the lack of profit. In response, I make the comment that profits are actually at a record level at the present time. There is a time lag between investment pick-up and the recognition of profits. The government is confident that profit will be a significant incentive to ensure a lift in investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Watson moved an amendment relating to superannuation that will be dealt with at the conclusion of my contribution. I read Senator Watson's speech&mdash;I was not in the Senate at the time he delivered it&mdash;and I note that he moved that the government be condemned for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)its lack of concern for the many casual, part-time and itinerant workers whose superannuation benefits are eroded by taxes, fees and charges; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)extending the coverage of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge to contractors;</PARA>
<PARA>This directly relates to this legislation. The first matter he raised in respect to part-time and casual workers does not relate to this legislation. The motion continued:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)calls on the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)modify the Superannuation Guarantee Charge system immediately so that it treats casual, part-time and itinerant workers fairly; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)exempt contractors from the provisions of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly we do not believe that the amendment should be supported. Firstly, in relation to part-time and casual workers, this is the wrong time and the wrong place to be dealing with that issue. I am sure that Senator Watson and I could talk about matters relating to superannuation for a great deal of time, given that he is the current chairman of the superannuation committee and I was the former chairman. The government recognises that small superannuation contributions made for employees are a problem with the superannuation guarantee charge because of the impact that superannuation fund fees and charges can have on those small amounts. I am certainly very well aware of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the government is giving a high priority to resolving this problem in consultation with a range of interest groups and parties. One option that has been mentioned is to give access to superannuation products to the banks. That is just one option; the government is looking at all of the options and is confident that the problem can be resolved soon. But the answer does not lie in limiting the coverage of the superannuation guarantee. The superannuation guarantee is a fundamental reform to improve the retirement incomes for all Australians so that they may enjoy a higher standard of living in retirement. The government will not be diverted from this basic objective. It is true that persons who receive employer support for their superannuation are not able to claim a deduction for their personal superannuation contributions&mdash;it is as true for people employed under contracts wholly or principally for their labour as it is for other employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot afford to maintain tax deduction concessions for people who are also receiving employer support. In dealing with this issue of part-time and casual workers, I think Senator Watson would be aware that the government will make a statement on this and other superannuation matters over the next few months. I do not know the date of that statement, but I do know that part-time and casual matters will be included in it. Therefore, it is a little premature of Senator Watson to attempt to criticise and condemn the government at this point in time. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a bit of slippage in your program. We wanted to keep you honest to your original program.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate you trying to keep us honest, but you are doing that on your committee which is looking at these issues. So it is premature for you to attempt to condemn the government when you yourself, on an all-party Senate select committee, are attempting to come up with some positive solutions about which, on the past record of the government's response to the committee, significant notice will be taken of your recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that Senator Watson criticised the government for on the superannuation matter relates to persons under contracts solely or principally for their labour, with which this legislation deals. The amendment in this legislation does not extend the scope of the superannuation guarantee arrangements. Under the law as it stands payments made to persons under contracts solely or principally for their labour are subject to the SGC rules. The amendments made by this bill simply seek to make that point clear in response to a particular technical argument raised which, I am advised, the Commissioner of Taxation does not accept; nevertheless, the matter has been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, it is clear that the government always intended that payments under contracts wholly or principally for the labour of a person should be covered by the SGC arrangements&mdash;see, for example, an information paper on the design of the SGC released by John Kerin when he was Treasurer in December 1991. So for that reason, again, it is unfair of Senator Watson to be moving an amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For how long was John Kerin Treasurer?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly not relevant to this issue. The fact is that the then Treasurer, John Kerin, clearly foreshadowed the intention of the government on contractors and we are clearing up any doubt, if there is any doubt, in this legislation. So I do not think that Senator Watson's amendment to the motion is appropriate at this time. Once Senator Watson and the committee have finished their deliberations and the government has responded, if he wishes to continue with that criticism, we might not necessarily accept it but that is the appropriate time to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter which has occupied the majority of the debate on this package of measures is the heritage conservation rebate. I am conscious we will be dealing with amendments on this in the committee stage and I do not want to go into all the detail now. I can indicate that we will not be accepting the amendments as moved by Senator Coulter or by the opposition. But I can indicate one matter that may assist the opposition in the way in which it pursues its amendments and that relates to the inclusion of National Trust lists. Senator Watson asked for an on the record response. It does pertain to Tasmania, and I think Senator Troeth mentioned it pertains to a number of other states, although I cannot recall the ones she mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can state on behalf of the government and confirm that the Heritage Commission, for a limited time only, is willing to ensure that, in states and territories where there are not yet substantial state heritage registers, it will undertake priority assessments of those places which are on the National Trust register and have applied for the scheme. This will ensure that the states, where there are no or limited state registers, are in no way disadvantaged. I give that commitment on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I want to deal with relates to an issue that Senator Short raised. This goes to the alleged constitutional problem of amendments the government is moving on the life insurance measures. There was no criticism of the particular detail of the amendments, so I will not deal with that in this debate. However, on the issue of constitutional matters, the office of parliamentary counsel has advised the government, on the basis of advice it has received from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), that the changes in respect to the life insurance industry and the grouping provisions in relation to company instalments should be made as requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice the government has received is at odds with that being put by the Clerk of the Senate. We are confident that the procedure that we are following is correct, and on that basis we intend to persist with our amendments. I do not wish to make any further comments on that. I am aware that there is an extensive range of amendments and obviously there will be considerable debate and comment on those in the committee stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few fundamental questions, which were raised by my colleague and partly answered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) during his speech on the second reading. Basically, I am now calling upon you, Mr Chairman, in view of your responsibility as deputy president of a responsible house of review, to comment. I want to be assured about the constitutional propriety of the processes that are being used by this government in the passage of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an assurance that the government had received advice but the details of that advice were not provided to the chamber. In view of your responsibilities as chair, I now call upon you, Mr Chairman, in consultation with the President, to look into the constitutional proprieties of the processes which the government has asked us to accept as mechanisms for the passage of this very important piece of legislation. For example, the questions we need assurances upon are these: how does the government justify calling this a taxation bill when it does not impose taxation; how can an amendment increase a proposed charge when the bill to be amended is classified as a bill which does not impose taxation; how can a bill such as this&mdash;introduced in the Senate and purportedly not a bill imposing taxation&mdash;be amended so as to increase the burden of taxation? The terminology used includes terms, such as `requests', which I believe are inappropriate in view of the advice that has been rendered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking for some mechanistic changes&mdash;changes that may be essential in determining the constitutional propriety of this bill&mdash;because I do not want to be associated with a piece of legislation passing through this chamber through processes that were inaccurate. I am calling upon you, Mr Chairman, in consultation with the President, to assure the Senate that the constitutional proprieties are sufficient because the government in the second reading speech gave us a blanket assurance, but no details, of the correctness of the procedures that are being adopted. They are somewhat novel. They were tried earlier and fell upon hard times. We have to be careful about accepting this because it will be a precedent. We have to clarify the position once and for all. Therefore, I seek your indulgence. </PARA>

As I said earlier&mdash;I am not sure whether Senator Coulter was in the chamber earlier when I responded in my speech to the second reading&mdash;we have had advice from the Parliamentary Counsel and from the Attorney-General's Department that we are following correct constitutional processes. Section 53 of the constitution says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for providing that advice to the committee. It would be unfortunate if we passed the legislation without having that advice tabled before us. Perhaps the appropriate procedure would be that, sometime during the committee stage or towards the end, we adjourn the debate pending the tabling of that advice. That could be done by tomorrow and I am prepared to accept the delay. However, I understand that the clerk has given you, Mr Chairman, certain advice that is in conflict with that which has been given to the government. So, there is some difficulty, and I believe that some time is necessary for further deliberation on those two very important issues. The passing of this legislation, saying that the bill is not a taxing bill but treating amounts as requests, raises, in my mind, certain inconsistencies. The processes that we employ must be clarified to ensure that in future the constitutional propriety not only for this but also future legislation is not put in doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Prior to asking for the tabling of the clerk's advice to the Chairman or the President or whoever, would the Parliamentary Secretary defer this clause until a later stage, pending our ability to tease out the issues raised within the advice given to the government and the advice given to the President of the Senate through the clerk? I hope the parliamentary secretary will be amenable to that. Otherwise we might have a somewhat extended and unnecessary debate on constitutional issues which may not be necessary. We could quite easily conclude the debate by tomorrow under those circumstances if the advice is not immediately available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that the problems are essentially of the government's own making because although the clerk's advice may have been given only at 7 o'clock last night, the amendments which created the problem in terms of the constitutionality&mdash;whether it is a taxing bill or whether a request for an amendment is appropriate&mdash;arose because at the last moment the government brought down a very extensive set of amendments, one of which affected superannuation and life companies. This gave rise to the particular problem at issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

It would be appropriate that the particular provisions as raised in the subtitle be deferred until a later date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Watson says `a later date' I am not sure what he means. Because of the practical problems we will run into, I suggest these amendments be dealt with at a later hour. We may then be in a position to provide Senator Watson with some legal advice on this matter.

I want make this clear for the record because it is an important issue. In case Senator Coulter, on behalf of the Democrats, is not aware of this, I point out that these amendments, which affect a possible loss to the government of $5 billion, were made public last December. As I understand it, they were amendments to legislation in the House of Representatives. At the request of the life insurance industry we did not proceed with them in the House of Representatives but withdrew them in order to consult with the industry about the details and the form of those amendments. It is not as though they have dropped out of nowhere at very short notice; they have been around for some four to five months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two issues here which are becoming somewhat confused. Senator Watson has a very valid point in relation to the way in which we should proceed with bills of this kind. It is not the first time that this matter has arisen; it has arisen in the past and there has been some confusion. It is clearly necessary to get that sorted out. In relation to this particular piece of legislation, if the government has any concern whatsoever about the constitutionality of passing these as amendments rather than requests, it seems to me that it would be wise to proceed down its chosen path and move them as requests. Clearly, they would then be passed by the House of Representatives and come back here and be passed. Then the legislation would be passed and would not run the risk&mdash;albeit it a small or outside risk&mdash;of being ruled invalid because the Senate had done something which was unconstitutional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point about which there is confusion is that if the government were to leave it there, the next time this type of legislation came up, the passage of this bill would probably be a confirming and reinforcing precedent which might cause us unnecessarily to go down the same road again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precedential nature of what we are doing is a matter for concern. I would certainly be satisfied if on this occasion we proceed in the way in which the government has outlined that we proceed, but that we get an undertaking from the government that it will bring forward this advice and that the matter be settled once and for all. When is a tax bill a tax bill? When is a tax bill not a tax bill? When do we proceed with requests and when do we proceed with amendments? Provided we do that, we are not in danger of dealing with this as a precedent which potentially could undermine the authority and standing of the Senate. Under those circumstances, I would be quite happy to proceed with the requests today as the government has outlined them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard what Senator Coulter has said. He is correct that there are two concerns. If I may address the first concern raised by Senator Coulter, I think this point is very important. The government sees these additional measures which are contained in the requests for amendments as having the effect of imposing taxation and, therefore, has brought them before this chamber as requests for amendments. That is the correct way to deal with such a measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem&mdash;and I wish to draw Senator Coulter's attention to this&mdash;is that, of course, the bill was initiated in this chamber. There is a further complication, which is that if the measures in question have the effect of imposing taxation by virtue of requests for amendments, and the government's form of bringing the requests for amendments recognises that, it becomes a taxing bill. Upon becoming a taxing bill, the difficulty is that it is a bill which could not be introduced in this place. So I think there is that added complication of which Senator Coulter was not aware. The consequence might be that, even if the House of Representatives were to agree to the requests&mdash;and we assume that it would&mdash;the bill could subsequently be invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued this matter should be dealt with expeditiously; that it should be dealt with now. The government says there is $5 billion that it wishes to ensure it can bring into its coffers. But the problem is this: this bill was introduced in this chamber on 3 March. That is when it received its first reading. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, said to us today, `This bill must be dealt with by the end of the week'. The reason the parliamentary secretary wants the bill dealt with by the end of the week is that he knows this is the last scheduled sitting week. But those requests for amendments were introduced after 3 March. If the government seriously had the proposals for the amendments circulating in the community in December last year, why is it that the bill did not receive a first reading until 3 March? Further, why is it that the requests for amendments did not come in at that point; they came in at a later point?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is so concerned about getting $5 billion worth of taxation revenue, it ought to do a decent job and bring the bill in on time, especially if it had circulated the proposals for amendments in the community in December. I say to Senator Sherry that there is no excuse for not bringing the bill in on time and not bringing these amendments in as part of a substantive bill. There is certainly no excuse for this bill being introduced in the Senate when the government's intention was always to use this bill as a mechanism for increasing the tax burden. It should have been brought in in the lower house. I say to Senator Coulter that the answer as to why it was not brought in in the lower house is that it was not sitting, because the House of Representatives does not carry the same workload as the Senate. The House of Representatives is, as the Democrats would recognise, the electoral college of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about ensuring the safety of the $5 billion of tax revenue it seeks to get by virtue of this bill, the only way in which the government can responsibly do that is to accede to the request of Senator Watson and defer consideration of these points until the government has at least tabled the advice it has received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this extraordinary situation in which Senator Sherry has brought before the chamber requests for amendments which I assume had been written on the basis of this advice, otherwise the government would not have brought them in as requests for amendments. So the government had the advice at the time at which the requests for amendments were prepared, before they were even tabled in this parliament. Yet the parliamentary secretary comes before us and says, `We have got the advice, but we can't give it to you right now. In fact, we probably can't give it to you until after we pass the bill. But pass the bill and trust us'. These are the same people who ask us to help them, because of the seriousness of the situation, to get the $5 billion secured for the government. That is an extraordinary proposition. It is utterly extraordinary. It really shows a grave degree of incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chairman, you, Senator Coulter and Senator Harradine will note the importance of the fact that these requests for amendments recognise that the provisions will increase the tax burden. Therefore, there is the added complication of an inconsistency of a bill which, by virtue of these requests for amendments, will become a taxing bill, being introduced in the Senate. That is contrary to the constitution. I believe Senator Watson's request should be acceded to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are as anxious as the parliamentary secretary to clarify issues such as car parking and other relevant matters. Since this consideration is being broadcast, a number of people may be wondering what the issues are in terms of superannuation, life companies and other registered organisations. The issues revolving around the issue of requests, et cetera, concern amendments to the income tax provisions that provide deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies and registered organisations in obtaining premiums which are excluded from assessable income. The purpose of the amendments is to limit the deductions to expenses incurred directly in getting the Australian income premiums which are invested to produce assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, there is no particular objection to the proposal. In the past, a number of life companies have been, we are told, claiming a number of deductions against non-assessable type income.

The industry has not come to the opposition, so we assume the industry is acceding to the government's request. We have no particular problem in relation to passing this piece of the legislation.

This whole question of administrative process is much more than that; we are talking about a critically important constitutional issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular requests for amendments have become the focus of it but they are not crucial in their own right. They are important, but they are not overwhelming. This debate is all about whether this bill with the proposed amendments is in fact constitutional. It is a problem that is entirely of the government's own making. None of this would have arisen had the bill originated in the House of Representatives. Had the government wanted it to originate in the Senate it could have used a simple mechanism to escape the present problem; it could have brought in another bill in relation to these particular requests. The bill could have introduced in the House of Representatives and it could have put it through in the normal way. Until recent times that always happened, and it should happen now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the government embarked upon this ill-fated venture of the classification of bills with the so-called omnibus tax bill, and that has led to this whole impasse. It is a very important issue indeed because it goes to the whole core of the constitutional rights of this Senate in relation to taxation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt, having been here I suppose longer than almost anybody currently in this chamber, as to our rights and responsibilities in this matter. They have been clarified in the letter from the Clerk of the Senate to Senator Cooney, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That letter makes it very clear that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993&mdash;the bill which we are considering&mdash;is classified as a bill which does not impose taxation. It notes the point that we have been discussing, that many of the amendments to be moved by the government are in the form of requests because the government takes the view that they have the effect of increasing liability for taxation and, therefore, fall within the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution in so far as they would increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. In his last paragraph on page 1 and first paragraph on page 2 the clerk states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paradox is readily apparent. How can an amendment increase a proposed charge or burden on the people when the bill to be amended is classified as a bill which does not impose taxation and therefore presumably does not propose any charge or burden on the people? How can a bill which could be introduced in the Senate (because it is not a bill imposing taxation) then be amended in such a way as to increase the burden of taxation? Can the Senate introduce a bill which it cannot itself amend in that way? If the proposed amendments have to be requests because they would increase a charge or burden on the people, does it not follow that the provisions in the amendments actually impose taxation?</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be eminently clear. I do not quite know why, in recent times, we have had this preoccupation by the government that amendments to bills such as these should be in the form of requests. I think we have to act in the certainty of what we have done over many years. Mr Chairman, I believe that you have been called upon to give a ruling. I hope that you will give the ruling in accordance with the practice that has been adopted by the Senate without challenge while I have been coming to this place, and that is 19 years or so. </PARA>

I make the point that the question of where the bill originated, for the purposes of the debate we are having, is irrelevant. The problem that we are pointing out and that the clerk has drawn attention to is that the bill was classified by the government as a bill which does not impose taxation. The government having so classified the bill, we say that there is an extraordinary paradox created by the government then adopting in this place the approach that we have to request amendments to the bill, because that, almost by definition, means that the government is here regarding the bill as a bill which does impose taxation. As I said last night, the government cannot have it both ways: either it is a bill which imposes taxation or it is a bill which does not impose taxation. That is the crux of the issue. I would say to Senator Coulter that the question of whether the bill originated in the lower house is not specifically germane to the core issue that we are considering here.</PARA></TALK.START>

This can be a conflict between both houses, perhaps ultimately justiciable before the High Court, but for the time being it is the will of the chamber which prevails. Whatever my private view might be, I do not think it should impinge upon the debate. If that frustrates anyone, I am happy to give a private view later on, but I think for the time being that the chamber is entitled to proceed any way it so determines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring forth today a matter of public interest. I do not think it is any great news for me to say that the rural industry in Australia is not having a very good time at present. When one runs a business&mdash;whether farming, small business or mining&mdash;in the rural areas of Australia, budgeting and control of finance are very serious matters. What is also very serious is the matter of insurance. In cases of unforeseen circumstances, a business might go into liquidation because an operator or a businessman may have to pay out for a vehicle or a plant that is not insured. That is why insurance is a very important aspect of business life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to bring in front of this chamber a matter that has happened in Western Australia with a particular person. Normally, I do not use this chamber to try to interfere with business or the normal backwards and forwards of what goes on in the thrust of business in Australia, but this is an outstanding and important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 December, a vehicle owned by a Mr Peter Capito and a related partnership and companies was involved in a serious accident involving fatalities at Greenmount in Western Australia. I am sure that most of the people in this chamber would have read about it in the papers at the time. There were only two fatalities but 21 vehicles were wrecked at the bottom of Greenmount. The Department of Transport is looking at reasons for that as far as the road goes, but that is not the matter I am addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a searching and detailed investigation by the police at the time, there has been no hint of any allegation of wrongdoing on behalf of the driver or of any defect of the vehicle. This matter is not in front of the Supreme Court yet and I hope it does not get in front of the Supreme Court. As it is not, I feel free to speak on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after the accident, Mr Capito&mdash;the owner of the vehicle&mdash;advised his insurer. That was 12 weeks ago. His insurer is connected to Elders Ltd of Australia and that company is Commercial Union. Mr Capito advised the insurer immediately of the fact of the accident. Despite cooperating fully with the insurer and the assessors appointed by the insurer, and despite making many phone calls, Mr Capito was unable to obtain any advice from the insurer as to whether or not it would indemnify him for the claims that were coming in. Honourable senators should remember that 19 vehicles were involved, as well as the other property and personal injury and damage caused in the accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until 16 March 1994, after intervention by a solicitor on behalf of Mr Capito, that the insurer indicated it would not make a decision on the question of indemnity until after the coronial inquiry. This inquiry, like all other coronial inquiries, is to determine the cause of death of people in the accident, not to determine the question of indemnity under an insurance policy. That is exactly what a coronial inquiry is, nothing else. It is not to inquire into whether insurance should be paid or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these hard times in the rural sector we have a case where an insurer, that is, Commercial Union, has been happy, along with Elders Ltd of Australia, for 60 years to take nearly $1 million of premiums off this particular farmer&mdash;and his father before him, of course&mdash;but when there is a claim, the insurer, on the most spurious of grounds, delays making good its obligations under the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that one of the things that has been raised is the experience of the driver. What qualifies a driver to drive a particular vehicle? It is having the licence that is required to drive that particular vehicle. An employer, talking to an intended employee, asks the employee, `How much experience have you had?' and `Have you got your licence?'. The employee says, `There it is', and one presumes that that is all that is required. If the insurance companies require more than the standard drivers licence, then they should make that a condition of the insurance policy. It is as simple as that. None of this was done and, as an excuse not to pay out, Commercial Union is pointing to the so-called inexperience of the driver&mdash;a driver, to my knowledge, who is well into his thirties and has had his drivers licence for a long time. How could he be classed as inexperienced? It is not any condition whatsoever of the insurance policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Commercial Union, along with Elders, has been happy to take $1 million worth of premiums off that farmer in the last 60 years. From my knowledge&mdash;and I know this family pretty well&mdash;the biggest damage that they claimed for was a bent fender on a car, in all that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the action of Commercial Union in failing to keep the policyholder advised in writing of the actions is to be deplored. Secondly, to use the fact of the coronial inquiry to delay making a decision on liability is a shabby manner in which to treat an outstanding member of the rural community. This person is an outstanding member of the farming community and other communities in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Capito is now waiting to replace that vehicle so that he can carry on his business of farming. What is more, the cropping season is around the corner in Western Australia&mdash;or we hope it is around the corner when the rains start coming. He will have to borrow in excess of $200,000 to replace the truck or to enter into an expensive leasing arrangement to ensure that the balance of his produce last year is carried to the market and, of course, to put the new crop in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is 12 weeks since he lodged his claim. If that was an average small businessman who was without his rig for 12 weeks, that person would be bankrupt&mdash;and would be bankrupt in a fortnight, let alone in 12 weeks. Yet here we have the Commercial Union refusing even to look at the situation. He has been told that he could hire a vehicle. He can do that but that is, of course, expensive. Then he has to keep all the accounting procedures to prove&mdash;in the Supreme Court, no doubt, judging by the way the Commercial Union is acting in this case&mdash;that he legitimately incurred those expenses. If the Commercial Union were to win the case in a Supreme Court action, then not only would he be without his vehicle but he would have a great cost and expense to hire the vehicle in the meantime. We in this place know what a court may or may not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to insurance, I believe it is time we looked at the question of policyholders, in circumstances such as this with Mr Capito in my state of Western Australia, to ensure they have a statutory right to the losses they incur so as to avoid having to prove the situation to a court. I call on the government to look at reform in the insurance field. I can say, in relation to a particular company that my own family is with, Westshore of Western Australia, that we have not had such fiascos as Mr Capito is involved with in this case with Commercial Union. Elders Ltd, which claims to be the top pastoral house of Australia, recently refloated on the stock exchange, is standing by&mdash;or seems to be standing by&mdash;and letting Mr Capito sweat it out. It has been collecting commission on premiums, and it has been collecting for Commercial Union. Yet it seems to be standing by and not bringing things on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to proposed reform of the insurance industry in Australia, maybe it is time for that when a policyholder submits a claim with a prima facie case that the accident did happen. Of course, the driver was sober as was proved. It was 10 o'clock in the morning so I presumed he was sober. But he was tested to make sure that he did not contravene the drink-driving rule. It should be a case where it is up to the insurer, not the insured, to prove that there is no case to answer. In other words, when a claim is made, I believe it should be up to the insurance company to pay up&mdash;in this case, in excess of $200,000&mdash;to replace Mr Capito's vehicle, and not make it mandatory for the one who is insured to prove the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments I have left in this debate, I just reiterate all I have said because this is a case that stands out. It was a very unfortunate case. Probably because of the lack of funding on that particular road over the years&mdash;even though Mr Brereton visited it last week and said that the Commonwealth would make funding available&mdash;it is very unfortunate that two people died in this accident that, to me, happened through no fault of the owner or the driver. There were 21 vehicles wrecked and the only saving grace of the accident was that there were not more killed. I welcome the federal government's promise to provide the money for an alternative route. But we have got a case here where Commercial Union Insurance has got a lot to answer for in not immediately settling the matter, and Elders Ltd also has a case to answer as to why it is not getting its insuring agents to the negotiating table and paying out that claim to Mr Capito. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw to the attention of the Senate today the work being done by the Jean Hailes medical centre in Melbourne. Mr Acting Deputy President, I know that you, as a medical practitioner, will be very interested in the work being done by this centre for menopausal women. It is doing exciting work. It was formed less than two years ago and it has had great support from the public ever since. It reflects the needs and the interests of women in the community for such a centre. It has got some notable features and I think that that is one of the reasons I would like to draw its work to your attention. There are 25 doctors working in that centre. They have given a great deal of commitment to the work being achieved for women, and all of the physicians there consult on a partially voluntary basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, who is away today, to take note of this, because he so readily talks about greedy doctors. He does not give credit for the work which is often being done in our society by the medical profession on a voluntary or part-voluntary basis. They have a noble tradition of this, and it should be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jean Hailes Medical Centre would, I am sure, have very great difficulty in continuing its work without that voluntary contribution of its medical people. It has a very hard-working committee, all the  members of which put a lot of people hours into the voluntary effort to support the administration and the administrative staff of the foundation. I visited the centre a couple of weeks ago when Minister Tehan from Victoria announced the Slezak research program, which was made possible through the tremendously generous donation of the Elizabeth and Nicholas Slezak trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research which will be undertaken as a result of this philanthropy will form the basis of ongoing work into heart disease and ovarian cancer. The research work that will be undertaken will help Australians to improve their quality of life. It will also help to reduce the health care bill that this society would have to bear otherwise. So the generosity of that trust is enormously important in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of menopausal women have long been ignored, I believe, as do many other women. To have private benefactors now springing to the support of research into the health of menopausal women is a wonderful step and it is in the right tradition. I would like to think that we in this country could encourage a tradition of philanthropy. We have had it to a degree, but nothing like, I would suggest, that which some countries in Europe, and the United States, have enjoyed for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limited amount of funding which goes from the Commonwealth government to medical research makes it all the more urgent that those who have done well in this country should see it as part of a trust, if you like, to give back to the society that has supported their wellbeing. This is what the Slezak trust has done and, as a result, we have a foundation which receives no government funding whatsoever undertaking very important work in the health care of Australian women. There is no government funding. If it was not for the generous donations of people like the Slezaks, through their family trust, and corporate sponsors, the centre would not even be in existence. I think that is an important item to be put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre is not only providing clinical help to women and now to important research projects; it has also introduced a medical practitioners training program that has received Australia-wide accreditation. There are medical practitioners coming to Melbourne, to the centre, from all over Australia, from as far away as Western Australia, to attend a special intensive program for a certificate in menopausal medicine. That has been endorsed by the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and also by the Royal Australian College of GPs. I understand that the centre is also planning a distance education program for this year; and that, of course, is also badly needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk a bit about the projects which are to be funded by this new donation from the Slezak trust. Two of the projects involve the role of oestrogen in heart disease prevention in women, and the third is research into ovarian cancer. The research is original and, to the knowledge of the centre, is not being done elsewhere. They are short-term clinical studies and the results will immediately benefit women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They address the effects of combined oestrogen and progesterone in women with either high cholesterol or known heart disease. The results will be immediately translatable into clinical medical practice, which, of course, is a very important element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research on ovarian cancer is focused on the mechanism by which ovarian cancer grows and spreads. Understanding this is the first fundamental step towards developing ways to treat this common malignancy. Thus, the research overall is directed towards ultimately preventing disease and improving the quality of life for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first study will compare the effect of oestrogen and a widely used cholesterol-lowering drug. If oestrogen is as effective, it may revolutionise the way women with high cholesterol are treated, because all the standard cholesterol-lowering medications have significant side effects. This research is a world first. The comparison has not been done before. Heart research still concentrates mainly on men, as research on women with heart disease is complicated by hormones and the varied effects they have on the body. The research program will take place over 12 months. Volunteers with known heart disease and high cholesterol will be treated with eight weeks of each therapy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second study is on heart disease also. Oestrogen actually dilates the coronary arteries in a way similar to the action of anginine, which is the standard medicine given to patients with angina. The aim is to take women with known coronary artery disease, give some women hormone replacement therapy and some a placebo, and after several weeks do exercise tests combined with heart scans and assess whether the oestrogen improves the blood flow to the heart. The important thing about both of these studies is that most research on women with heart disease has focused on the benefits of oestrogen. What happens when women are given oestrogen and progesterone is controversial. The feature of both these studies is that they can have immediate effects on clinical practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third research study extends into ovarian cancer. More women die of ovarian cancer than of all other gynaecological cancers combined. Most women with ovarian cancers are not diagnosed until cancer has reached a late stage. In Victoria, 180 women die each year of ovarian cancer. The majority of these women are over 50. There are 280 new cases of ovarian cancer each year. The aim of the study is to investigate where the vascular endothelial growth factor comes from and its role in the spread of ovarian cancer. Being able to stop the growth of tumour blood vessels may be one way of controlling cancer. This two-year research program could have a major impact on women's health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put the work of the foundation into its national context. In Australia, the average life expectancy for women is 80 years. This means that most women live one-third of their lives after the menopause. By the year 2030, 25 per cent of our population will be women over 45 years. Women over the age of 60 currently represent eight per cent of Australia's population, yet they occupy 40 per cent of health care beds and utilise 25 per cent of the total expenditure on health maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten thousand post-menopausal women suffer an osteoporosis-related hip fracture each year. About 20 per cent of these women will die in hospital after prolonged hospitalisation. Osteoporosis costs the community over $300 million a year. Heart disease is the major cause of death in post-menopausal women; one-third of all 50-year-old women will ultimately die of heart disease. While women live longer than men, they also experience, due to ill health, double the amount of physical handicap of men. The lifetime risk of women developing cancer is one in four. Cancer is the second most common cause of death and is predominantly a disease of the older person, with 56 per cent of all cancers occurring in people over the age of 64 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the major diseases affecting women are preventable if detected in the early stages. That is why today I want to commend the work of the Jean Hailes Foundation. I commend the work of those who have given their money and their time, who are engaged in such important research, clinical work and the training of GPs. Not only will they save lives; they will also, importantly, save the cost to our health budget, which our health minister recognises is so desperately stressed. There are currently no proper solutions for improving the health care of Australians while the resources are so limited. Work such as that carried out at the Jean Hailes menopause centre will help to ensure that Australian women get quality care and the chance to prevent disease that they otherwise may suffer from. I believe it will improve the quality of life for all Australian women. </PARA>

Right through life we see instances where people have told lies and been brought to account. We know that if people in business, bank managers, lawyers and so on deliberately and publicly tell lies, things they know are untruthful, deceitful and false, they are brought to account. In general business life, there is consumer affairs legislation in each state requiring advertising to be truthful and accurate.

The examples are too myriad to go through, but I will mention a couple of very simple ones that easily come to my mind. There was the ALP advertising that clearly said, `Everything will go up 15 per cent'. The party knew that was a lie but it persisted in it and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it.

For some reason, the members of the press never seem to take that up; I am absolutely flabbergasted that they do not but that is what happens. Under this government the Commonwealth taxpayer gives the union money and then the union gives it back to the Labor Party to use as election campaign funds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems fairly clear that Senator Sherry and the ALP are sensitive about what I am saying because they know it is true and they do not want the public of Australia to learn about it. At every opportunity Senator Sherry takes points of order which he knows are incorrect, but he will do anything to curtail opposition, to restrict the Liberal and National parties from having their say. If that is not the way that other man I just referred to carried on in Germany in the 1930s, I do not know what is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, under this government the Commonwealth taxpayer gives money to the unions in so many ways that we have documented. The unions then give it back to the Labor Party. The Labor Party uses those enormous funds to print the lie or telecast the lie or broadcast the lie on the basis that if the lie is told often enough it will stick and people will think it is true. That is what happened in the last federal election. There was that constant repetition, `15 per cent more on everything; 15 per cent more on everything; 15 per cent more on everything', and the people of Australia fell for it. It was a lie; it was a deliberate lie and the Labor Party knew it. All of that is past history. I suppose we should be aware of that; we should expect it; we should know it is coming up. It never fazes the Labor Party. It is not worried about it; it does not have a conscience about it. </PARA>

We have the ALP at the same old tricks. In Townsville, where the ALP incumbent council is in some danger, they are printing huge advertisements saying, `Liberals want you to pay $200 more in water rates'. I have the advertisement before me; there it is in black and white. The same is on the television screen. I cannot produce that but it is all there.

The written policy of the Liberal Party, and the spoken policy, which can be heard in media interviews on radio and television, says just that. But what have members of the Labor Party said? They have said that it is going to go up $200. They know that that is an outright and deliberate lie. I would like Senator Sherry or some of his cohorts over there to explain that.

<PARA>This is sourced from a report of a Labor-controlled city council, yet it is being promoted as part of Liberal Party policy. It is an outright and deliberate lie. It does not stop in Townsville. As the shadow minister for local government, I have received complaints from other councils where, lo and behold, the Labor Party is up to its old tricks. The team currently controlling the Mount Isa City Council is called the United Progressive Council Team. The team is a front for the ALP, and nobody denies that.

The current mayor and deputy mayor are shown on a placard outside the trades hall in Mount Isa as being the chairman and deputy chairman of the local branch of the Labor Party. I do not think they are now, but the placard shows that they certainly have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else do we find in Mount Isa? We find that the Labor Party is advertising the council team and, among other things, it shows a candidate, Rod Wilkinson, as Alderman Rod Wilkinson. As some honourable senators will know, a person has to be an existing member of council to be called an alderman. Rod Wilkinson, nice fellow though he may be, is not an alderman. This is a deliberate and outright lie by the Labor Party in Mount Isa to make the people of Mount Isa think that their team is a team full of existing aldermen. The advertising goes on to suggest that this is a great team of elected aldermen who have been there for many years. Of course, with the ALP team in Mount Isa, very few of the current aldermen have ever been elected. They have been appointed, as people who were elected have resigned, by the Labor Party machine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the Mount Isa Labor Party has been running a television advertisement using Tony McGrady, the local Labor member and resources minister in the Queensland government. He is a popular and well regarded figure around Mount Isa. They have got him standing with the team, and the wording on the advertising more or less says, `This is your team for the council'. Tony McGrady used to be the mayor, but this advertisement is obviously putting across that Mr McGrady is still part of the council team. By using Mr McGrady, it is encouraging people to vote for the team and get them over the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and on with this, but my concern is more with the deliberate lies the ALP tells, prints or broadcasts at election time. I have moved motions in this Senate asking for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to investigate these misleading, deceitful and false claims used by the Labor Party in election advertising. It is not happening just with local government elections; the same thing is obviously happening with federal and state elections. The Labor Party does it with impunity. There is no way it can be called to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wonder how long the people of Australia are going to accept a government, a political party, that goes out of its way deliberately to tell untruths, deliberately to mislead, deliberately to deceive the public in paid advertisements, when the Labor Party knows that they are not true. I just hope that, somewhere alone the line, the press will be outraged. It is only when one can get the press outraged that the general body of the Australian public can understand the enormity and the widespread nature of this deceit by the Labor Party in its electoral advertising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I raise a matter of public interest, I would like to support what Senator Macdonald said about the behaviour of members of the Labor Party when they get their hands on the levers in local government. If the people of Townsville, in particular, do not want to believe what Senator Macdonald said, perhaps they would like to believe me. I actually lived in a shire in Western Australia which was controlled by the Australian Labor Party. I am quite happy, if I can find them, to table in this parliament my rates notices over the first three years I lived in that shire. Every year my rates would come in and I would get a beautiful glossy newsletter from the Labor mayor saying that my rates would never increase from year to year. Every time I got this glossy newsletter I would still get my rates notice. In the first year I was there my rates were about $500; the next year they were $800; and in the last year before I sold my property the rates were $1,400. That is fair dinkum evidence of what happened to the rates in a Labor shire in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the people of Townsville to heed the words of my good friend and colleague Senator Macdonald when they think about how they are going to vote on the weekend. I say to them, `Do not believe the Labor lies and do not risk the beautiful city of Townsville to a bunch of people like those in the Labor Party. They have shown year in, year out, right around Australia in local government, state government and federal government that they cannot be trusted with your money. So do not trust them in Townsville'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to raise today relates to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of today's date. It refers to a demonstration yesterday outside the state parliament of Western Australia by a bunch of people who are opposing the voluntary student union legislation that is going through that parliament. I have wished this legislation a speedy passage on a number of occasions in here, as I do today. It is interesting to see the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper because it repeats some of the disgraceful and disgusting lines that are proffered by people who support compelling young Australians to join a union against their will, and against their birthright of freedom of choice, when they go to a tertiary campus in Western Australia&mdash;indeed, in just about every state of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guild president at Murdoch, Adam Bandt, spoke to the gathering outside parliament yesterday and said, in what I think is a disgraceful piece of misinformation, that the legislation of Mr Norman Frederick Moore, the Minister for Education, is a transparent attack on students' rights to organise. I remind honourable senators that that legislation is to ensure that when students go to universities in Western Australia next year they will have the freedom to decide whether or not to become a member of the student union of their choice. That was a stupid and misleading statement. To compel, through act of parliament, young Australians at the age of 17 or 18 to join a union, against their will in many circumstances, to prevent them from having the freedom to choose whether or not to join, is the most fundamental attack on their right to organise that can possibly exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a voluntary regime, where individual students have the right to join a union or not to join a union, they have the ultimate right to organise. That is, they can create a student union of their choice. If they do not like the student union that is in existence, they can form other organisations that may compete against the other student union. They have the ultimate right to organise, the ultimate right to be involved in the democratic processes that elect the leadership of the union. If they do not like that union, they can run against those people in democratic elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me mention one of the other farcical things about the rallies that the students have held outside Parliament House. I had the misfortune to attend one of them a few months ago. These people who claim to stick up for student's rights are so much in favour of people's freedom of speech and freedom to organise that when I sought to address the meeting they actually tried to stop me. They did not want to allow anyone who had an opposing view to address the meeting. It was a public forum. That was quite incredible. I was stunned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of transgression of fundamental rights that one would expect in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. But it was outside the parliament of Western Australia. As a Liberal, I was stunned that a bunch of students who one would think would be upholding students' rights and freedom of speech&mdash;which people at Kent State University died protecting back in the moratorium days and the days of the protest against the Vietnam War&mdash;were actually stopping me and people like me who wanted to put an opposing view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I know you hold strong beliefs in this area and I am sure you would find their argument farcical as well. The argument they used was that, under the former state government's 54b legislation, people were required to get a permit to have a march. In fact, it was Sir Charles Court's government that brought in that assembly law, requiring people to get a permit to organise a demonstration. It was very controversial at the time, and I was quite proud that I demonstrated against that legislation of the previous state Liberal government of Sir Charles Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these people, who were not old enough to have demonstrated back in those days, in the early 1980s, used the permit they had got from the police department or wherever one gets them from, to say, `We got the permit so that we could have our public meeting. So we are allowed to speak and you are not'. I thought that was an incredible stretching of the 54b assembly laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to conclude because I envisaged that my friend and colleague from Tasmania Senator Abetz would be discussing a similar matter shortly. However, I want to address quickly what the federal government has done to make this whole situation worse. When the legislation of Mr Moore, the Minister for Education in Western Australia, passes into law shortly, students will have the right to choose whether or not to join unions when they turn up on campus at this time next year. I genuinely hope that many of them do join unions. A lot of people think that this law is being brought in to destroy student unions. That is not the case. It is being brought in for one reason, and that is to give young Australians the freedom to choose, which is their birthright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I genuinely hope that all of the students join the union next year. They will have the freedom to choose whether they will or not. If the guild or the student unions do things that are bad and unrepresentative and if they do not actually look after the interests of their members, many people will choose to save their $200 or $300 and not join. The student guild could become so unrepresentative, so stupid and so irrational and could prove to be so badly administered that the membership might fall to abysmal levels. The sad thing is that the federal government, through its amendments to the States Grants (General Purposes) Act and through its recent amendments to the higher education act, actually guarantees ongoing funding of these student guilds no matter how unrepresentative and no matter how stupid these unions happen to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the federal government have done by supporting the funnelling of federal taxpayers' moneys into student guilds should their membership and their income fall has virtually ensured that there is absolutely no incentive for student unions to go out and recruit people, to encourage people to join and be active participants in student politics on campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian Labor Party were committed to democratic involvement, freedom of association and getting young people actively involved in student politics and running their own affairs on campus, it would have not have brought in these stupid amendments which virtually ensure that the heads of the student unions can sit back and do nothing. They do not have to go out and sell their services. They do not have to go out and recruit. By doing this, the government has actually ensured that student unions will crumble. I think that would be very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat my heartfelt hope that all students will join the guilds, but will do so in the full knowledge that they are free to choose. I look forward very much to the day when Norman Moore's legislation is passed by the parliament in Western Australia. I am assured by both Mr Moore and the Premier, Mr Court, that that legislation will be passed in the first session of the new parliament. I will certainly be celebrating when that takes place, on behalf of those tens of thousands of students who will, for the first time in the recent history of Western Australia, actually have what should be regarded in a free Western society as a birthright, that is, the freedom to choose whether or not to join an association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on matters of public interest to support the matters raised by my colleague Senator Ian Campbell, who has a very proud record in supporting matters of human rights and individual choice. My attention was drawn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper by my colleague Senator Campbell, and I can indicate to the Senate that I am very concerned by the smorgasbord of elements who seem to have lined up behind compulsory student unionism. First of all, we have the president of the student union, or the student guild, who seems to make some cheap political point by parodying the Lord's Prayer, which is, in my view, tantamount to blasphemy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation here is that we have a smorgasbord of interests, one being this student union leader, who clearly is concerned about his little empire being taken away from him because he realises that, if the students were given a choice, they would desert. It is a very poor confession by Mr Bandt that he acknowledges, in effect, that if students were given the choice the student union movement would collapse. What he is saying is, `There would be no way we could get the average student to sign up with the student union I lead if they were given a choice'. That really is a very sad reflection on him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the Greens in Western Australia lining up behind compulsory student unionism and saying that the moves are leading the state towards fascism. How on earth can one assert logically that giving individuals the freedom of choice can be likened to fascism? Indeed, it is the exact opposite. What we in the Liberal Party believe in, and what the Western Australian government has clearly shown that it believes in, is the right of individuals to choose whether or not they belong to organisations. If that is somehow fascist, I really believe that I might be living in a different country or, indeed, on a different planet from the Green MLC referred to in the article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also amazes me that the Greens, who believe in the right to protest and doing things of that nature, now appear to have moved so far to the left that I am sure that, if they continue with their public utterances, they will move so much further to the left that they will fall off the political stage. </PARA>

Indeed, there is in this House a coalition between the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party. The sooner the people of Australia realise that the Greens are just the extreme left wing of the Labor Party, the better it will be for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that concerned me in this article was that the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said that the federal government would continue to give money to student bodies in Western Australia and Victoria despite state government moves to make them voluntary. The federal minister, in effect, has asserted that he will penalise the states though the States Grants (General Purposes) Act and would in effect give the states less money. That, of course, is a complete affront to states' rights and the right of the states to determine their own social policy in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what this is really all about is the federal Labor government once again giving money to an organisation, such as a student union, knowing full well that that money will be spent on behalf of the Australian Labor Party come the next federal election. Clearly, what Simon Crean, the minister, is doing is ensuring that the mates that supported the Australian Labor Party at the last federal election continue to be protected and provided with funds in the event that there is another election. It really is a terrible indictment of the federal government that it is willing to deal with taxpayers' money in such an outrageous way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party, including Senator Ian Campbell and, indeed, the Western Australian Liberal government, has a very proud record of giving people the right to choose. The people of Australia ought be aware that, in the case of compulsory student unionism, the situation is that, if one does not pay the fee, results are withheld. In other words, the fruits of one's labour are withheld and one is denied the tertiary qualifications and results for which one has worked all year. Of course, that is a great blot on our tertiary institutions, which ought to be, after all, the very havens of free thought and individual expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying that, no matter what the wish of the Western Australian people as expressed at the last election with regard to a policy clearly enunciated before the Western Australian election, it will go against the wishes of the people of Western Australia and cut back states grants, as a result, to support a student union which by its own admission, it would appear, will collapse because the students in the universities are no longer be willing to join the organisation because of the way it is run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure to have supported Senator Campbell in relation to this matter, and also to put on record my support for the Western Australian government in legislating to ensure that students are given freedom of choice as to whether or not they wish to belong to a political organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the last opportunity I will have before Anzac Day to deal with a matter relating to Australia's heritage, which is certainly very close to me and, I know, very close to many members, particularly on this side of the chamber. I do not want to make a political issue of this when I say `on this side of the chamber', because obviously many honourable senators on the other side of the chamber are also concerned about the heritage significance of Gallipoli and Anzac Day, even though that concern does not appear to be shared by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who somehow feels that Australia had no military heritage until the New Guinea campaign 27 years after the drama of Gallipoli.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to raise it is that at the end of January this year I was fortunate enough to visit Gallipoli and to see where these dramatic, incredible events actually took place. It is an experience that I will certainly never forget and an experience that I hope many Australians have the opportunity of having because it does dramatise the incredible difficulties and the extraordinary heroism that were required to overcome those difficulties. It gives one an immense feeling of pride in being Australian and in that part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What particularly impressed me about that visit to Gallipoli was to be informed by the Turkish authorities of the enormous number of young Australians who come to visit Gallipoli. The great majority of Australian tourists to that area are backpackers who have come to see this important part of their heritage. In fact, the younger generation of Australians appears to be far more alert to the significance of Gallipoli and Anzac Day and our heritage in this respect than the present generation. They certainly seem far more alert to it than our Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to note the number of tourist hotels or facilities providing accommodation to younger Australians. It seems that there is an `Anzac House' hostel or hotel in most of the small towns around there, particularly in Cannakkale which is across the Bosporus but which is the tourism centre for those people wanting to see Gallipoli. It also happens to be conveniently close to Troy which is certainly a place worth visiting. One comes across the evidence of civilisations so ancient and yet so significant and so well developed. As I recall, there are something like 11 Troys on the one site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wanted to take this opportunity to thank those Turkish officials who were involved in my visit, who not only facilitated it but who extended very kind hospitality to me. In particular, I would like to mention the Director of Tourism of Cannakkale region, Mr Nasit Bora Aydogan, who was a very kind and hospitable host. He arranged my bus visit to the battlefields where it is incredible to see the trenches&mdash;in very modified form, I guess, as 75-odd years of weather have obviously largely destroyed them. People can still see the outlines of the trenches and how close they were, particularly at the neck where hand grenades would be thrown from one trench to the opposing trench something like 10 metres away. The hand grenade would then be thrown back; it was an incredibly dangerous way to try to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That tour was uplifting and exciting, particularly to discover the significance the Turkish people themselves recognise in the Gallipoli campaign because it was there that Ataturk probably had Turkey's only victory in the First World War. It was a victory very hard fought against a very tough opponent, particularly in that rugged part of the campaign where the Australians and the New Zealanders were fighting but also in the other parts of the campaign where British and other Commonwealth troops were engaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turks have created some very significant memorials, not only to their own troops but also to the Australians and New Zealanders and other Commonwealth members who fought in that campaign. There are some touching memorials. The most touching, I suppose, are the gravestones of young Australians, some as young as 14, who had lied their way into active service. You see memorials to them and to so many other young Australians. I imagine that the young Australian backpackers who come to see this part of their heritage cannot help but be moved by noting the number of people of their own age or younger who died in that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Mr Aydogan, I want to say how grateful I am for the outstanding support and assistance he gave me and for arranging my visit. I also want to thank Mr Hanifi Araz of Anzac House, who organised a tourist guide, Mr Graham Lee. Mr Lee is an Englishman but he is cognisant of the significance to Australia of the Dardanelles campaign. He took me around. In fact, he helped me discover a bullet which still had some explosive in it. The explosive powder which we shook out of the bullet burnt with quite a fizz after all those years. It had rained quite recently and, when it does rain, all sorts of mementos are uncovered in those trenches, from bones to bits of pots and other evidence of people spending a long time in appalling conditions fighting bitterly in a very tough campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The respect which the Turks hold for the Australians is manifest. The fact that the Turks now venerate a campaign that brought about a revolutionary change in their own country is something of which all Australians should be aware. If it had not been for Ataturk's enormous popularity emerging from his successful Dardanelles campaign, a brilliantly fought campaign on his part, there is no doubt that Turkey would not have made the incredible leaps forward that did take place after the First World War. For example, Ataturk gave the vote to women long before many so-called civilised Western countries did. That is a matter of great significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank very much some people who facilitated the trip. One is Oguz Ates, who was the first secretary at the Turkish embassy here in Canberra. I am very pleased that I will have the opportunity tonight to have dinner with the Turkish ambassador, Ambassador Aka. Oguz Ates gave me the appropriate names and facilitated my visit by arranging for me to see, for example, the Turkish consul's tourism expert in New York when I was attending the United Nations General Assembly. She was a marvellous help in making the booking arrangements for accommodation and so on. Naturally, I paid for it, Mr Acting Deputy President. Otherwise I would be declaring an interest in the sense that I had received a benefit. That was very welcome assistance and I thank all of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing I should mention in passing before concluding. I would say to those who wish to go there that it is about a six-hour bus ride from Istanbul. If people go in mid-winter there is something of a problem. The Turks are still very enthusiastic cigarette smokers, it is quite cold in January, and the bus windows are hermetically sealed. My wife and I found that, in spending six hours in a 50-seater bus when there were 48 Turkish smokers, we tended to do a little bit of involuntary second-hand smoking. Apart from that slight inconvenience, it is a magnificent place, which Australians, if they get the opportunity to visit, should not miss. I am certainly very grateful to all the Turkish officials for their very kind hospitality. They took my wife and me to dinner and were magnificent hosts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also should mention the people of the Australian War Graves Commission who were very helpful in this matter. Mr Volkan Susluoglu was very kind and assisted in a significant way. I say to honourable senators, if I have not been able to encourage any other of my colleagues here, to try to go on this visit because it is very well worth while. If they are in Europe, on the way back from Europe, on a study tour or attending a delegation meeting in Europe, they should try to see this. It is vital, to my mind, that all members of parliament should be well aware of our heritage. It seems to me that some things that some members of the Australian parliament are saying indicate a lack of understanding and appreciation of the significant heritage factors&mdash;heritage milestones, if you like&mdash;that we do have in our short but very significant history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that people who denigrate the Senate necessarily do not understand the significance of heritage, but I think that an understanding and appreciation of heritage would give a far greater and much better balanced view of what some of the symbols of being Australian are all about, particularly the flag and so on. So I encourage, not only the people of Australia to visit Anzac and, if they can, to do it on Anzac Day, but also encourage Australians far and wide to share in this terribly important part of our heritage. I am very grateful to the Turkish authorities who facilitated my visit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind the minister that a week ago he assured the Senate that Mr Keating was not seeking to delay the promised inquiry into the ministerial conduct of Mr Griffiths and that such an inquiry would soon be established. I remind the minister also that on Sunday Mr Keating referred to `residual matters' which still need to be determined before he could act on the Griffiths affair. I therefore ask the minister: what are the residual matters to which Mr Keating referred? When will the inquiry be set up? Does the minister not now agree that, as two people close to Mr Griffiths have been charged, it is in everyone's interests that the outstanding issues concerning Mr Griffiths's ministerial conduct be resolved as soon as possible?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly in everybody's interests&mdash;not least those of Mr Griffiths&mdash;that any outstanding question marks be removed. As compared with the situation as I had it in mind when I spoke in this place last week, the problem is that there has now been a move, as Senator Hill intimated, to launch a prosecution not just against Mr Lennox but also against Ms Harrison. Associated with that is the further problem of some advice being received from the prosecution authorities that under the circumstances there may be difficulty in seeking evidence from not only the people who are the subject of the prosecutions but also perhaps Mr Griffiths himself as a potential key witness in those prosecutions. Working out the implications of that for the inquiry&mdash;an inquiry that everyone wants to see speeding on its way and addressing these other issues about the handling of bank accounts, ministerial propriety and so on&mdash;has been made rather more complicated by that development.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week's national accounts data told us that overall the economy grew at the very robust rate of 1.7 per cent for the December quarter and four per cent for the year. Buried in all of that information was data about the agricultural output, showing that the trend increase in farm output for the year was also a growth of around four per cent&mdash;the exact figure is 3.8 per cent&mdash;mainly from strong growth in crop production. That is the output side of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously farmers also want to know what prices they will receive for their effort. Yesterday's release of commodity price forecasts for 1994-95 from ABARE sheds a great deal of light on this important matter. ABARE makes the following points. A stronger world economy in 1994 and, more particularly, through into 1995 is expected to boost world commodity demand and prices. Commodity prices are forecast to rise by six per cent in 1994-95 compared with falls of eight per cent in 1992-93 and two per cent in 1993-94.</PARA>

For the base metals, the prices of lead, zinc and nickel are also forecast to rise significantly. That is good news, for example, for the partners in the McArthur River lead and zinc mine, which is now being developed in the gulf country of the Northern Territory after, I might say, a successful negotiation with the local Aboriginal traditional owners, despite all the scare tactics being run consistently by the opposition on that subject.</PARA>

I refer to the taxation statistics for 1991-92, tabled last week, which highlight that high income earners are paying less tax and middle income earners are paying more tax than a decade ago. I ask: why has the Labor government chosen to use tax concessions and credits to give preference to high income earners and speculative investors? What is the rationale for this conscious choice by the Labor Government? Did it really believe in the trickle down theory?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will answer the last part of Senator Kernot's question, relating to 950,000 Australians being out of work. As far as I recollect, if a person is on unemployment benefits that person is not a taxpayer; that person is part of the outlays side of the budget. The taxes raised in the community go to supporting that person on unemployment benefits and providing access to labour market programs to get that person back into the work force. For those on unemployment, the equality issue that Senator Kernot raises in the first part of her question is not appropriate. They are beneficiaries of the budget and of the massive expenditure that this government outlays on labour market programs, training and retraining aimed at getting them back into the employable work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to the first part of the question&mdash;the real content of Senator Kernot's question&mdash;as to whether there is indeed a degree of equity in tax collection between middle, low and high income earners. I have before me a brief from the Treasurer on the subject of claims that income inequality has increased under Labor, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the case. A study by Anne Harding and John Landt on Trends in Disposable Income in Australia found that since 1983&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the year in which we came to office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there has been a substantial income redistribution towards lower income groups.In 1992, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a publication on the results of a study which showed that the net effect of benefits and taxes in 1988-89 was to reduce inequality in the distribution of income by over one third.</PARA>
<PARA>So in relying on those two sources of external authority&mdash;an independent study by two recognised and respected academics&mdash;there has not been the redistribution away from lower income groups that is often alleged of the government. In fact, there has been a redistribution towards lower income groups. On the ABS figures the point is clear that, under the coalition government that preceded us, the reverse was true.

It is no longer satisfactory to rest on that kind of arrangement. It is very important that we establish processes for early intervention and even prevention in this area of child abuse&mdash;whatever that sort of child abuse is. We should be very celebratory that the Commonwealth and the states have reached this agreement. We look forward to the implementation of this strategy making a difference in terms of the protection of our children.</PARA>

Further, the Wilderness Society has not paid the statutory fee to the Tasmanian government to allow the Wilderness Society to run the raffle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and follows earlier questions in this chamber relating to tensions on the Korean Peninsula and issues of nuclear non-proliferation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;North Korea's nuclear program, together with its most recent refusal to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify the nature of this program, has obviously heightened tensions in the north-east Asia region. It is against this background that the decision has now been taken to deploy patriot missiles in the ROK. It is for South Korea and the United States to make their own decisions regarding their defence needs. The US has made clear that patriot missiles are a defensive system and that their deployment on the peninsula has been under consideration for some time. This move should, therefore, not be seen as an indication that the prospect of conflict on the Korean peninsula has come closer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on a number of occasions in this place, the DPRK nuclear issue is a matter of direct security significance for Australia. It is now before the UN Security Council as a result of the IAEA resolution adopted on 21 March. There is still time for North Korea to reverse its position in the dispute over full access by IAEA safeguards inspectors. We very much hope that Pyongyang will take this step. Failing that, we see a graduated series of steps likely to occur by the UN Security Council, starting with exhortatory action, moving forward towards more direct action, probably in the form of economic sanctions, as the need for stronger political action builds. It has to be stressed that throughout this process we and others will be very much seeking to keep available channels for dialogue with the DPRK open. We are encouraging Pyongyang to think very carefully about the risks of proceeding further down a path of confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me say this: there are ways that can be found to resolve this issue and to accommodate North Korea's own security concerns, as has already been made clear to Pyongyang.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer the minister to the comments of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals on Senator Richardson's paper on private health insurance. Is Senator Crowley aware of the restrictive trade practices being exercised by some private health funds? In particular, is she aware of the practices of the HBF in Western Australia, including demanding the right to access the private hospital's documentation detailing all operating costs and profit margins as well as details of the patients and procedures undertaken; restricting the level of fees a hospital can charge patients regardless of whether they are HBF members and indeed preventing any reductions for pensioners; and insisting the hospital discuss any `unusual fees' with HBF before a bill can be issued? Does the minister agree with these practices? Is it now government policy? Is it not a fact that Senator Richardson's package will worsen this situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2064" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the specific matters in relation to the HBF in Western Australia, but I can comment in general. Some health funds have attempted to adopt unacceptable restrictive practices. Health funds in Tasmania, other than Medibank Private, have sought to force hospitals to cease giving discounts to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Trade Practices Commission intervened, and that attempt has been stopped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently the MBF in New South Wales issued a circular saying that it was concerned that some hospitals were offering cheaper bed day charges to some patients. MBF wanted the hospital to increase charges for such patients as it undoubtedly saw such discounts as being at the expense of higher charges for its members. The MBF threatened to reduce its bed day benefits to the level of the lowest fees being charged by a hospital. This certainly would have left patients out of pocket. The theory seemed to be that this would create patient pressure to make hospitals increase charges for non-MBF members. Senator Richardson intervened and MBF decided to cease action on this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly it is unacceptable for private health funds to seek to stop a hospital providing lower fees for other people. It is also unacceptable for health funds to collude to achieve such an objective. However, it is perfectly reasonable for health funds to seek to get the best possible deal for members. Clearly, if a health fund simply lets private hospitals charge whatever they wish, fund members may have to pay for any undue generosity either through higher out of pocket costs or through higher premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health funds in Victoria have entered into preferred provider arrangements with hospitals which guarantee members on such tables no out of pocket costs for accommodation expenses. It is entirely appropriate for health funds to attempt to negotiate the best price for their members. It is also appropriate for private hospitals to attempt to negotiate the best prices from their perspective, but whether cost information is exchanged in such negotiations is a matter for the health funds and hospitals involved in those negotiations. The situation is not markedly different to the government wanting cost details in considering introducing new items into the medical benefits schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson's proposals are based on private health funds taking a greater role in negotiating on behalf of members. That is an appropriate commercial and consumer approach, but it is not in the interests of consumers to continue an arrangement whereby hospitals set whatever bed day charges they like, which people with insurance have to pay one way or another. Senator Richardson's reform arrangements will provide for an appropriate framework, while dealing with restrictive trade practices. Without pre-empting the consultation process, it is highly likely that the Trade Practices Act will continue to apply to funds and hospitals. Similarly, the reforms that deal with cases where a health fund owns the only private hospital in a town will probably be requiring such a hospital to offer no less generous prices to other funds than it provides to its own funding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The export access program continues to be successful and is getting more popular all the time. So far, the government has allocated $20 million to the program up till the end of 1995. This will allow 1,400 small or medium sized enterprises to be processed as part of the program. The funding support is for 25 project managers located in industry associations and overseas business offices in St Louis in the United States of America, Osaka in Japan and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 March this year, 485 firms had been accepted at a rate of about 50 to 60 a month. Over 170 firms had finished the program and had been issued with surveys. Evaluation of this important program is vital. We continue to evaluate the success of the program at all phases. The first 107 firms surveyed have shown spectacular results. Eighty-four per cent of those companies have successfully arranged long-term export business. These are ongoing relationships, not one-off contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred of the firms surveyed had already achieved $7.6 million in export sales and, within three years, they expect sales of $78 million. This is just for the first 100 companies processed out of the 485 firms which have now entered the program. These firms have demonstrated a commitment to exporting. Fifty have appointed agents or distributors, 16 have entered joint ventures and 13 have signed manufacturing under licence agreements. The licensing agreements alone will generate around $2 1/2 million in royalties over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the companies applying for export access have turnovers of between $1 million and $5 million per annum and employ between 10 and 50 staff. Sixty-eight per cent anticipate future job growth, 88 per cent intend to sustain export drive and 100 per cent will apply again to join the program. This is another example of the good relationship that this government has with the small and medium enterprise area of Australian industry, in that a program funded by the Australian government and administered and organised by industry itself has returned very good results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These results show that the McKinsey report of last year, which report outlined the need for our SMEs to get into exporting, is being successful. That is why in the last budget the government increased funding by another $30 million as part of a general assistance package to SMEs, including assistance in export access. It is a successful program. The government is very proud to be associated with small and medium enterprises in Australia.</PARA>

How can the government justify a 33 per cent increase in the cost of telephone calls from public telephones when Telecom has just announced a half-yearly profit of $1 billion, even though the latest Telecom quality of service report has shown a deterioration in the standard of service? Surely the minister has to agree that the Australian people should expect better service from a cashed up Telecom before it clobbers the poorer members of the public with a 33 per cent price rise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts announced yesterday that he received a revised proposal from Telecom for a 10c increase in the basic public pay phone call rate from 30 September of this year together with details of a transitional subsidy package to ease the impact of the increase on some 2.3 million low income earners. Briefly, this transitional package provides for the once only free issue of a special $4 phone card to approximately 2.3 million people who are eligible. To be eligible, people must be recipients of social security or veterans affairs pensions who do not receive the telephone allowance rebate on private telephone rental, or people on jobsearch, newstart or sickness allowance special benefit, or low income health care card holders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that ACOSS has said that the amount of the subsidy is perhaps not enough, but I would like to stress that that is only one initiative that has been taken in relation to the affordability of telephone services. The opposition is yet again suffering from very convenient amnesia on this particular issue. I am sure honourable senators on this side of the chamber would recall that the Minister for Communications and the Arts informed the House of Representatives last month that he had written to the Minister for Social Security requesting the assistance of his department in exploring a long-term solution to the problem of how to make it easier for low income earners to have access to home phones. This exercise will examine specifically the needs of low income earners in relation to telephone services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom's original proposal last November presented a sound but business-like case for the proposed rate increase. Public pay phone charges in fact have not been increased since 1986. Since that time the CPI has risen by 38 per cent but the average total cost to the user of the public telephone service has decreased by some 21 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time, pay phone serviceability has improved from 65 per cent to 91 per cent in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel, in its report to the Minister for Communications and the Arts on 21 January this year, recommended that the minister not disallow the proposed increase.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worthwhile highlighting the hypocrisy of the opposition. Those opposite are complaining about this increase, the first in eight years, but it is important that we place on record that it was the coalition that doubled the cost of pay phone calls from 10c to 20c in 1982.

In talking about the compensation package, and in relation to what ACOSS said, I ask the minister whether he really believes that the 10 free phone calls provided by the phone card to be distributed will really compensate low income earners adequately, particularly the unemployed who are desperately trying to find jobs and who need to make phone calls to find those jobs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The peace clause does not absolve the common agricultural policy from international scrutiny and challenge since the agricultural agreement in the Uruguay Round requires a major reduction by the EU in its levels of agricultural support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the peace clause was part of the Blair House Accord between the US and the EU and basically provided the EU with assurances that if it met its Uruguay Round agricultural commitments in respect of domestic and export subsidies it would be free of GATT action in respect of those subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential elements of the peace accord were subsequently written into the agreement on agriculture as part of the Uruguay Round.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is aware of concern by the local tobacco industry about Australia's commitments in the Uruguay Round, particularly the requirement to convert the local content scheme to tariff only protection when the Uruguay Round is implemented, probably in early 1955. The government is also aware that the industry is currently subject to an industry commission enquiry which will be submitting recommendations on the future tariff regime for tobacco. The industry's concerns have been understood by the government and I am confident that a solution can be found which will ensure Australia's Uruguay Round obligations are met and which will provide a continuing market for Australian produced tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1993 the US introduced new legislation which requires that local manufacturers use a minimum of 75 per cent locally produced tobacco. That legislation has not yet been implemented. It has been challenged by nine countries as being in contravention of US obligations under the GATT (Article III, National Treatment), and a panel has been established to investigate the complaint.

<PARA>As I said in my supplementary question, even Senator Robert Ray, who was no friend of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the Australian Labor Party's earlier leadership bloodbath, has by now so succumbed to the Prime Minister's imperial style that even he treats this extravagant waste of taxpayers' money as a matter for humour and levity. That clearly demonstrates just how out of touch not only the Prime Minister but also his ministers&mdash;indeed the whole Labor government&mdash;have become with the real attitudes and needs of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that not only has the sleeping facility of the Prime Minister's dog been heated at some expense to taxpayers but it also appears that the dog is being fed $28 per kilo meat at taxpayers' expense&mdash;another extravagance! The government and its ministers are so out of touch, as Senator Ray indicated in his answer, that it completely misses the point of this issue: the attitude of the Prime Minister&mdash;an attitude which says it is okay to use taxpayers' money to heat his dog's sleeping facilities. At a time when some 950,000 people are unemployed and thousands are homeless, many  without so much as a roof over their heads let alone money to put food on their table, we find the Prime Minister displaying utter contempt for them by abusing taxpayers' money in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting aspect of this issue is the way in which the government appears to have gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up this provision of the facility to avoid embarrassment. Senator Ray misled the Senate in the answer that he gave to me, and then used semantics to get around it. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> sought an explanation of this issue in a freedom of information request to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The newspaper asked that the freedom of information request be interpreted as broadly as possible. But again, some time after I had asked my question, that department was still denying that this facility had been provided at taxpayers' expense. So, clearly, there has been an attempt by the government to cover up this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amazingly, Mr Keating's imperial lifestyle obviously extends even to the family dog. This imperial hound living in the Lodge appears to live even better than the Queen's corgis. It seems that it is costing over $100 a week to keep this dog in the lap of luxury. Obviously the government has been embarrassed by the series of exposes on the Prime Minister's lifestyle. We have had the Thai teak table, the Gould bird print fiasco and, on top of that, we now find a dog living in the lap of luxury at taxpayers' expense. No wonder, when this embarrassment is exposed, the government wants to cover it up by telling lies to this Senate and not answering questions as they were asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw Senator Ray try to avoid the issue by saying that he had answered correctly when he said that no heating had been provided in the dog kennel. Firstly, I did not ask whether heating had been provided in the dog kennel. I asked whether it had been provided for a dog kennel, which meant it might have been in the kennel or it might have been in a room in which the kennel was located. This was predicated on the reasonable assumption that this dog kennel, apparently so lovingly hand-built by the Prime Minister, would certainly be the area in which Ruben was sleeping. It turns out Ruben does not like what his boss built for him&mdash;he is not sleeping in the dog kennel; he is sleeping in a vestibule entry to the Lodge. He is so disgusted with the kennel that they put his dog basket in this vestibule, and that is where he is sleeping. The fact that he was sleeping there led the Prime Minister to have the heating installed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To dismiss the issue as Senator Ray did, on the basis that he was correctly answering the question, clearly indicates an attempt to deliberately avoid the issue. The question was certainly broad enough for Senator Ray to come back and provide an honest answer by saying, `Yes, heating had been provided for this dog. Sure, it wasn't in his kennel but it had been provided where he was sleeping and it had been provided solely for the benefit of this dog'. Apart from storing a few pool chemicals and other items, the room's only other use is to provide sleeping quarters for the dog, so the heating has obviously been provided purely for the dog's use. Mr Deputy President, I come back to the only conclusion that can be reached on this issue: this government has completely lost touch with the Australian people, and its abuse of taxpayers' funds in this way clearly demonstrates that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very long time since I have seen Senator Chapman so animated about anything, which says quite a lot, I guess, about his priorities and those of the opposition on this particular matter. The animation, unfortunately, does not seem to have extended to his brain cells or to his judgment. I would remind him that on one famous earlier occasion another in a long line of failed leaders of the opposition actually lost his job when he said, `Woof, woof' in the Australian parliament, and Senator Chapman might recall that. I suggest that Senator Chapman is perilously close to suffering the same kind of fate if he pursues this particular idiocy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation about the heating is as follows: it is the case that an electric strip heater was installed in the rear vestibule of the Prime Minister's lodge to warm those coming into the inside of the house from a chill Canberra winter. Ruben the dog is an incidental beneficiary of action taken to warm people coming in from the cold outside. What Ruben has not been a beneficiary of is the largesse of the taxpayers so far as his food supply is concerned. Senator Chapman introduced today, following the extraordinary story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, or whatever it was, on the weekend, the canard that Ruben was being fed not only some exorbitantly expensive eye fillet&mdash;more expensive than I have ever heard of at $28 a kilo&mdash;but that he was being paid for by the taxpayer. He is being paid for, I am advised, by Mr Keating himself&mdash;by the Keating family out of their own income. That is an absolute piece of nonsense. Ruben is no different from any other dog in the country; he is being paid for by the family. No doubt he is very comfortable and very relaxed. So he is not a beneficiary of the taxpayers' largesse in any sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Mr Crouch has been a beneficiary of the largesse of Mr Connolly of the opposition on this, as on previous occasions, with his publication almost word for word of the press release, large chunks of which were read into the record as Senator Chapman's own deathless prose a couple of minutes ago. Mr Crouch has a conspicuous record in these matters. It is only a matter of time before we find him rummaging around the Lodge garbage cans, I suppose, trying to find yet another piece of evidence to sustain his particular conspiracy theory about fraud upon the taxpayer at the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing that has not been a beneficiary, I would suggest, from this particular escapade in which Senator Chapman has made a fool of himself is the opposition. Members of the opposition have demonstrated once and for all that the beneficiary has not been their reputation. They have demonstrated once and for all that they have no understanding of what the real issues are that worry and concern the people of this country. This search for the frivolous and the trivial, and being utterly misconceived and misinformed at the same time, is doing the honourable senator and his reputation no good whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Cook quoted from a study which he claimed has shown that the re-distributive effects of Labor tax policy in the last decade were illustrative of the fact that it has advantaged low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to place on record some quotes from another report, by Mr Phil Raskall, of the University of New South Wales, who has been surveying wealth distribution in Australia for the past three years. This is the report which Mr Martin Ferguson released and quoted from a couple of weeks ago. The major findings of this report can be summarised as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distribution of both income and wealth in Australia has become more unequal since 1981-92.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook talked a lot about assistance to low income earners. I think he overlooked the way in which the social security system is being used. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the social security system has helped to redistribute income and protect the lower paid and disadvantaged, inequality in the distribution of wealth and income has increased as a result of (amongst other factors)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;larger wage and salary increases for the higher paid and the greater access to tax minimisation strategies in designing remuneration packages&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is this latter point to which I have particularly drawn attention&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">&mdash;dividend imputation and the removal of the 60% top marginal tax rate which have considerably enhanced the wealth and income of the top 10% of income earners and families.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn to table 1.3 in this report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the early stages of the Labor Government, up to 1986-87, the personal income tax system was substantially more progressive than that under the later years of the Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor government started off with reasonable intentions, but, as the report shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . commencing in 1987-88, changes made severely reduced its progressivity to about the level that prevailed under the Liberal-National Party coalition.</PARA>
<PARA>The period 1987-88 was when Paul Keating was Treasurer. Despite what Senator Cook says, the biggest reduction&mdash;5.7 per cent&mdash;in average tax paid relative to income in this time has accrued to males earning three times average weekly earnings&mdash;just under $100,000. Whilst most other groups received a net tax cut in the period, the lowest paid&mdash;females on slightly under $11,000, half the average earnings for women&mdash;paid more of that income in tax at 10.1 per cent than in 1983-84. There is a clear conclusion that the personal income tax system has become less progressive under this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish with an example: in 1982-83 the average taxpayer in Paul Keating's working-class Bankstown paid 20.4c in the dollar. Over in John Hewson's higher-income electorate of Edgecliff they were paying 33.5c. A decade later, Bankstown residents were paying 20.9c and in Edgecliff they were paying 31.83c.

<PARA>The minister would not answer my question at all and sought to divert attention from it by launching an attack on me. So I will have to answer the question for her. The minister has refused to address a public meeting on the issue of the Childcare Rebate Act and the home child-care allowance and has now apparently arranged an alternative function. She has refused to nominate somebody else to represent the government's position on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees and I will speak in relation to our parties' positions, but the minister has refused to nominate anybody to represent the Labor government. The minister is treating with contempt those mothers who choose to stay at home to care for their children. She is simply not prepared to defend her government's policies on the issue of caring for children, whether externally or in the home. She is not prepared to front a group of several hundred people who are extremely concerned about this government's policies on this issue. The government treats mothers at home very differently from mothers who put their children in child care. This is causing unbelievable anger and anxiety in the community. The minister is refusing to deal with or front the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Carroll's campaign has engendered an unbelievable response. I will be tabling tomorrow a petition with over 9,000 signatures on it from people from all over Australia who are upset with current government policy. There have been thousands of calls to my office alone about this issue. There will be a rally in Adelaide and rallies around Australia on this issue. The government ignores this issue at its peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Carroll does regard Senator Crowley's personal treatment of her as contemptuous and rude. Senator Crowley did threaten Mrs Carroll over the home child-care allowance bill and suggested that mothers who stayed at home ought to be thankful that this bill had been introduced, although all it does is convert the DSR into a home child-care allowance and add a paltry $2.88 a week. It is ridiculous to compare that with the situation with the Child Care Rebate Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why these people are so incensed. They are very upset that under the Child Care Rebate Act there is a non-means tested $61.20 a week paid to a mother of two children who puts her children in child care, but a mother of two who stays at home to look after her children gets a very heavily means-tested $30 a week. The discrimination is as blatant as that. The government is placing twice the value on children who are put in external child care as those who are cared for at home. That is the nub of the issue and that is why people are incensed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister referred to my position. I think this raises a very important issue about the role of senators and the role of parliamentarians. My position on the child-care rebate is utterly irrelevant with regard to my responsibility to bring forward to the Senate the genuine concerns of thousands of people about a particular issue. We do have a responsibility to enable expressions of community concern to be brought to the attention of the Senate regardless of our particular positions on the issue. To suggest otherwise is nonsense. To suggest that whether or not I support the Child Care Rebate Act would influence the question of whether I table these petitions is nonsense. If everybody in the Senate supported the Child Care Rebate Act, the thousands of people out there who are concerned about it would never have an opportunity to put their views to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition in the Senate&mdash;including myself&mdash;were opposed to the Child Care Rebate Act in its original form. We sought to have it amended to provide for means testing. It is ridiculous that this child-care rebate will be paid regardless of income, that this money will be paid out of general revenue to millionaires, regardless of their means, whereas the home child-care allowance starts cutting out if a mother earns more than $282 a year. So we did oppose that element of the Child Care Rebate Act. We still believe it is wrong. We strongly believe the government's treatment of children, be they in external child care or at home, should be equal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Crowley lost the plot totally in the answer she gave to a question by Senator Minchin. She said, `If you want to go out and say to the women of Australia, "we won't pay you the HCCA"&mdash;which they are all looking forward to&mdash;and if you want to say to them, "we'll take away the HCCA", you go and say it, Senator Minchin'. All I can say is that it was bizarre. Senator Minchin was not saying anything about taking away the HCCA. I think what has happened is that Senator Crowley has now begun to believe the government's own PR machine. Before the last election, when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was giving one of his various speeches containing lots of promises which he has broken, he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, a Keating Government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse at home caring for children. The new Home Child Care Allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home caring full time for children.</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of people thought then that they were going to get an extra $30 a week. They were misled in some ways because it just slipped over like this; that is what they thought they were going to get. As Senator Minchin said, they get a paltry $2.60 increase under the home child-care allowance because the dependent spouse rebate that they were getting under the tax act now goes across to the Social Security Act. Our party has supported the home child-care allowance bill. What we have not supported and what we have tried to change is the fact that a number of the families listening to the Prime Minister give that speech would have thought they were going to get that home child-care allowance, but they will not get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who will not get the home child-care allowance include families in which the dependent parent or child is out of Australia for longer than 13 weeks; for example, exchange students, aid workers, missionaries, and young academics going on leave, say, to try to improve their understanding and knowledge for the benefit of Australia. Others who will miss out include families in which the youngest dependent child is a full-time student aged between 18 and 25 when the child earns less than $1,785 a year; a lot of young rural people; students who are not in a position to get part-time work to earn that much money; families in which the dependent child is a prescribed student; and families who are disadvantaged by a different definition of income in the Social Security Act from the definition that is in the tax act. They are the issues we have been trying to address. </PARA>

It has been said that the opposition supported amendments which mean that the home child-care allowance is under threat. That is absolute baloney; it is rubbish. We want amendments to address the issue of the families that are missing out on the home child-care allowance that they believe they were promised and that they would have been entitled to had the same test that applied under the dependent spouse rebate applied to the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley said, `You want to tell people you won't pay the home child-care allowance'. She has started to believe the sort of nonsense Mr Baldwin is putting around&mdash;that we are threatening the home child-care allowance. That is a load of rubbish. We support the home child-care allowance, but we do not support the fact that a number of families will be disadvantaged and will miss out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense for Senator Crowley to come here and say that Senator Minchin is going around saying that we will not pay the home child-care allowance.

Why does the government persist in the desecration of high conservation value, old-growth national estate forests for logging operations and for woodchips when this is actually a violation of its own policy?

Secondly, it has hoped that no-one will notice that its national forest policy is not being implemented.

<PARA>The Auditor-General's report No. 32 is an important report on whether or not governmental agencies are ready for accrual reporting. This report was foreshadowed yesterday in the Auditor-General's report No. 27 on ministerial portfolios, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many organisations will soon need to introduce accrual accounting systems, particularly as the level of audit qualifications indicates a widespread need for system development and improvement. In addition, the level of accounting skills in government departments needs to be addressed. The results of a recent ANAO survey indicate that the great majority of departments recognise the need to employ qualified staff in specialist accounting positions, but only 35% of these positions were filled by qualified accountants.</PARA>
<PARA>Only about a third of the accounting jobs in government are filled by accountants with any qualifications. This is an absurd situation. The Auditor-General was quite correct to say that this matter must be addressed, particularly when we are moving to a new form of reporting by governmental agencies&mdash;accrual accounting&mdash;which many of the professionals involved do not feel comfortable with, and will need to undergo a fair level of training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dramatise the sorts of difficulties this inappropriate recruitment puts governmental bodies under. It may well explain why this government keeps making such a terrible mess of so many of its accounting procedures. It also may explain why the government wants to limit the capacity of the Auditor-General to examine so many things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has been under non-stop attack by this government for continually pointing out the error of its ways, the mistakes it makes and the breaches of various governmental acts that are undertaken by departments. Often one wonders whether it is with the knowledge of the minister who could not care less, or whether it is a matter simply of gross incompetence, perhaps emerging from the fact that such a small proportion of accounting officers within the bureaucracy have formal accounting qualifications.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the organisational staffing requirements flowing from management reforms generally and the move to full accrual reporting in particular. These requirements include the short and long term need for accounting specialist expertise, appropriately trained support staff and the managers who possess the necessary knowledge/understanding of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of real concern that government accountants are apparently not qualified to cope not only with the situation at present but also with the need for significant change and reform in the methods of accounting and reporting that are now under way. The Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This lack of preparedness is illustrated by the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the proportion of specialist accounting positions filled by qualified staff was, in the ANAO's view, surprisingly low, especially in view of the fact that the majority of agencies themselves consider such qualifications desirable and most agencies reported no difficulties in filling such positions with qualified staff</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that the move to full accrual reporting will require significant changes to an agency's operations. Depending on the size of an agency, the changes are likely to necessitate revising the organisation structure and staff profile, providing adequate training and other support needs for staff and assessing the level of changes to be made to accountable reporting systems. There are indications that some agencies are not approaching the move to full accrual reporting with the importance it deserves. As a result there is a risk that problems faced due to a lack of preparation for earlier reporting reforms will occur again, and the potential benefits to be gained from full accrual reporting may not be realised.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that this is one of those reports from the Auditor-General that this government takes seriously because, unfortunately, this government does not seem to put the level of significance on the Auditor-General's reports as the opposition does. We can see that from the way the government tried to belittle the Auditor-General's report into the sports rorts. That report revealed that everything we had been saying for four years was totally right and there had been in fact a monumental rip-off for political reasons of the public purse by politicians in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General plays a vital role. This is a very important report.

<PARA>We have to be convinced that all these people will in fact meet these requirements and develop these skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see how it has been going so far. I commend the table on page 26 which shows the proportion of specialist accounting positions filled with formally qualified staff. The table shows: 57 per cent of chief finance officers were formally qualified staff&mdash;I admit that that figure is better than average; 36.8 per cent of financial accountants in governmental agencies were financially qualified; only 36.3 per cent of management accountants had formal qualifications; only 21.4 per cent of cost accountants had formal accountancy qualifications; only 28.2 per cent of accounting advisers had formal qualifications; and only 24.6 per cent of Acc and FMIS specialists were formally qualified. There was one area where 100 per cent of staff were qualified, and that was in the area of graduate accountants. Obviously, one cannot be a graduate accountant unless one is a graduate. The average number of specialist positions in government agencies filled by staff who did not have formal qualifications totalled 35 per cent. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that only 35% of specialist positions were filled by qualified staff at the time of the survey, a surprising result was that, for each type of position, a minority of agencies indicated difficulty in filling them with qualified staff.</PARA>
<PARA>That does strike me as extraordinary at a time when I would have thought plenty of people with these qualifications would be looking for jobs. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a substantial proportion of staff (between 30% and 48%) had no educational qualifications or formal training relevant to the functions they performed. Numbers of clerical accounting staff with relevant training and/or educational qualifications were low in most of the accounting/finance functions covered by the survey, with less than 50% for all but one function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant proportion of professional and clerical accounting staff reported a need for training across a wide range of accounting and finance functions.

<PARA>This matter is gone into at greater length in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to keep the Senate any longer except simply to point out that this is a matter of some significance as the government is moving more and more towards accrual reporting, as I believe it should. The question that the Auditor-General asks is: are agencies ready? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be that they are not as ready as they should be and that there is a lot of work to be done to ensure that accrual reporting will be a success. I hope the government knuckles down to recognising the need to take some fairly energetic action to fix up this matter that the Auditor-General once again, for the benefit of the parliament, has brought to our attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might give a little background. The government amendment sought to overcome a problem arising from the leasing method of calculating the appropriate amount in terms of the gross rental. The government amendment has actually been superseded as a result of a decision of the High Court not to allow special leave to appeal by Citicorp from a full Federal Court decision. The issue in that case was essentially that Citibank was assessable on the gross rentals received under the financed lease of cars but was entitled to a depreciation of limits, subject to the limitations contained in section 57AF of the cost limits. As a result of the decision of the Federal Court, reinforced by the decision of the High Court not to allow special leave to appeal to the High Court, the government's amendment is rendered unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a proposed amendment to clause 40. I want to say something about this amendment which has been distributed for a couple of days now. I hope that honourable senators have had a chance to focus on this amendment. In effect, the amendment was accompanied by an explanatory note which details why I feel the amendment is necessary. It is a technical amendment designed to correct an erroneous view of the law which is being put forward by the Commissioner of Taxation in draft taxation ruling TR94/D8 on child maintenance trusts. The commissioner has adopted an extremely narrow technical interpretation of the phrase `pursuant to' which would prevent any person in the country from ever enjoying the benefit of the exemption which parliament gave to the children's income from child maintenance trusts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be borne in mind that parliament made this decision and the effect of the proposed taxation ruling would be to deny the exemption in a way that was not intended by parliament. The purpose of the exemption was to prevent children's incomes from maintenance trusts being taxed at penalty rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government itself has acknowledged the absurdity of the situation in a press release on the matter. However, according to the press release, the government does not propose that the law be amended to give effect to the original intention of parliament in relation to child maintenance trusts established before 7 March 1994. This amendment should not cause people too many problems. It is, after all, an attempt to restore what parliament intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue I want to raise with the committee is the way in which the commissioner has used the ruling system to attempt to impose upon taxpayers a blatantly artificial and contrived interpretation of the law which deprives them of that exemption which parliament clearly intended to give them. If the ruling system is to be used in that way&mdash;that is, to impose upon taxpayers views of the law which are not soundly based&mdash;parliament may have to consider the question of whether taxpayers should be subjected to any detriment where they choose, on better advice, to prepare their tax returns in a manner at variance with what is, after all, only the commissioner's view of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the tax treatment of family income transfers generally, but that is not a subject matter with which the committee needs to be involved at this stage. I do flag that at some stage I will be raising that matter. I again say that this is an effort to overcome the effect of a ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation which was to deny what parliament clearly intended to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the commissioner's ruling is merely his view of the law. His extraordinarily narrow view of the phrase `pursuant to' may well be corrected by a court taking a purposive interpretation as in the Cooper Brooks case. However, it would be a waste of administrative and judicial resources to test by way of a set of legal disputes a futile interpretation of a law which no-one argues was the parliament's purpose. It would also wreak havoc amongst taxpayers. Parliament can correct this manifest error in administration and ensure that the intention of the law is fully carried out in regard to all child maintenance trusts established since the introduction of the original legislation. That is the purpose of my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I have gone no further than restore what I believe to have been the intention of the parliament, which was superseded by the Taxation Commissioner's ruling. I have not actually moved the amendment at this stage. I will do so, however, depending on any response that the parliamentary secretary might give to my explanation in foreshadowing that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The draft taxation ruling that Senator Harradine was referring to was TR94/D8 concerning child maintenance trusts. It has been suggested in relation to the draft ruling that perhaps the law may need some amendment. Adding to clause 40 is the basis for Senator Harradine's proposed amendment. My understanding of what he is seeking to achieve is that the underlying intention of division 6AA, which was always quite clear, could really be achieved. I believe that the announcement by the Treasurer was designed to make the necessary amendments. Perhaps he is seeking some sort of an assurance from the government. What stage are we at in relation to the issues raised by him? I think proceeding with his particular amendment is worthy of some assurance or comment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the problems with the press release of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is that it clearly is not the intention of the government to restore the benefit in respect of child maintenance trusts established before 7 March 1994. In other words, the Assistant Treasurer said that the Taxation Commissioner's ruling was really a nonsense&mdash;it was not in accordance with the intention of the parliament&mdash;but that the government would not do anything to restore the exemption from penalty tax on those child maintenance trusts which were established prior to his press release. What has his press release got to do with this?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that very often taxation matters are dealt with by the Treasurer from the date of a press release. We have been down that road for many years. We have dealt with that subject in debate on retrospective tax measures that have come before this parliament over a number of years. This is not a question of retrospective tax measures. This is restoring to taxpayers their rights in accordance with the intention of the parliament. For the government to say now, by way of press release, that it is going to levy penalty rates of tax against child maintenance trusts which were established prior to the Assistant Treasurer's press release is a denial of justice. It is certainly a denial of the intention of this parliament when it made that decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we get a response to the matter raised by Senator Watson, I indicate that I will be covering it to a significant extent in the comments I make in response to Senator Harradine's amendment. Firstly, the government will not accept Senator Harradine's amendment for two major reasons. One is that it does not believe that the detail of Senator Harradine's amendment is sufficient to cover the issue he is trying to address. We do not believe it is correctly worded or sufficient in its coverage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are concerned about the retrospective element. Senator Harradine has been critical of the fact that the Assistant Treasurer's press release, in announcing that this matter does need to be dealt with, is prospective. That is a little harsh in that the tax treatment of trusts established before the date of the Assistant Treasurer's media release will be appropriate. They are not disadvantaged if they have been established before the date of the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, as Senator Harradine has pointed out, has announced that normal rates of tax are to apply to arms-length rates of income for property transferred for the benefit of a child as part of a legal settlement following a family breakdown. This change is meant to apply to a range of such transfers of property which are not conditional on orders for dissolution or nullity of a marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's proposed amendment may not protect the position of all children for whose benefit property was transferred before the date of the effect of the government announcement. It may apply only to income from property transferred to provide for child maintenance. The most common situations in which property is transferred for a child's benefit in circumstances of family breakdown may not be dealt with by Senator Harradine's proposed amendment&mdash;for example, where parents cannot agree on the division of property between themselves but, nevertheless, agree to transfer some property for the benefit of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the date of the application of the changes that the government announced in that press release is something the government is prepared to consider when the bill is introduced for these changes and is put before the parliament some time between now and the end of this year. We are prepared to look at that operative day. At that time it will be necessary to consider the commissioner's view on the operation of the law as it stood before the announcement. At this stage, the commissioner has only issued a draft taxation ruling on which comment has been invited. Finally, it would also be necessary to consider the date of application of other changes announced by the government as part of that legislative package. I am not sure whether that answers Senator Watson's question fully. That is the government's position in response to Senator Harradine's proposed amendment. </PARA>

I remind the chamber that large companies will now be required to lodge their tax returns on 1 December instead of on 15 March. How far does this government intend to squeeze the cash flow of companies, given that corporations must now cope with initial tax, quarterly instalments and extra taxes arising from the fringe benefits tax changes on items which were not previously subject to tax deductions but which are now deductible and subject to fringe benefits tax arrangements?

The government in no sense seeks to put a cap on that amount; a person is either entitled to a rebate or is not. We find it rather strange that in this area the government may well be breaking totally new ground in providing a rebate but giving power to the minister to limit the total amount of that rebate scheme, and then setting up an elaborate structure by which people would have to reapply for the application of the rebate to their particular work. Clause B3 of section 159UA says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total of the amounts specified in certificates that the Minister approves in a financial year is not to exceed a limit set by the Minister (section 159UD).

It is a very old town which contains the oldest Catholic church, the oldest bridge, and the second oldest Anglican church in Australia, and a range of very old historic buildings. I used to live in one of them. During my youth my parents spent quite a lot of time and money doing up that old building. Later on when my parents moved to the north-west coast of Tasmania to the small township of Latrobe they had what would be regarded as an historic cottage and they spent some money and effort doing it up. I have been doing up an old terrace house, which is over 100 years old, in my new residence in Burnie. It was moved to there from a mining community on the west coast. I do enjoy and have a great love for our heritage, but there are limits to the extent to which we can fund these sorts of initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept Senator Coulter's analogy of no limits on rebates in the health area. Certain cost areas that affect our lives should not have a cap on the rebate, and medical costs are one.

The sub-division provides for rebates of tax for approved expenditure on certain conservation work on listed heritage buildings and structures, and expenditure must be at least $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the series of amendments that we have introduced is to reduce that minimum from $10,000 to $5,000 because we are concerned that there will be a lot of people who will spend amounts of money under $10,000 and who could be denied this sort of benefit. I am also concerned about the inclusion of these sorts of provisions in income tax legislation. In the interests of equity and fairness, I would have preferred these to be in the form of grants rather than rebates because lower income earners in our community who may live in old cottages will not necessarily get any financial benefit as a result of the measures that we will be passing today. Therefore, in terms of equity and fairness it would be more appropriate that pensioners and low income earners, who may not have a taxable income but necessarily have to spend money on upgrading their old cottages and buildings, should be entitled to something. </PARA>

At a time when the government is actually preaching tax simplification I ask the parliamentary secretary why these measures are included in a tax bill, especially when expenditure need not be related in any way to income producing activities of the taxpayer.

I make a point about lowering the threshold for conservation work to $5,000: the government has targeted work over $10,000 because it is balancing the overall goal of conserving a significant number of historic properties against the administrative costs of spreading the conservation dollar further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With due respect, Senator Watson, we do not know. Frankly, from my experience I do not think $10,000 would go that far, given some of the costs involved in buildings. At the recent heritage ministers' conference, the state and territory ministers, including the Liberal ministers, agreed to cooperate in managing a new Commonwealth tax scheme which promotes the conservation of heritage buildings and structures. However, the ministers were anxious to ensure that the scheme was manageable. It is important to monitor approved work to ensure the scheme does not encourage damaging or inappropriate work. The greater number of smaller projects will be difficult to oversee. Owners of commercial properties can already claim for maintenance work under other sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA></TALK.START>

For every $1 million in revenue forgone by the government $5 million is spent on heritage conservation work. It is very labour-intensive and has a very useful spin-off of being a significant contributor to employment. The government believes that the approach we have adopted in terms of administrative costs and ensuring that the work is done in a correct and accurate manner, is a preferable approach to a simple grants scheme where the controls and criteria might not be able to be applied as tightly as we would like. </PARA>

Senator Watson's amendment, if proceeded with, would have had the effect that during the coming financial year applicants for rebates on buildings which fell within the National Trust classified lists but outside the other heritage lists would be eligible, but the removal of his amendment and the substitution of the government's assurance mean that in the coming financial year none of those applicants will have that rebate scheme available to them.

<PARA>This amendment seeks to insert a new division into the legislation. As explained at the second reading stage, it is to provide a rebate scheme to those people who provide gifts of real property to natural heritage conservation organisations. It anticipates they would be registered and recognised in an appropriate way. As I indicated earlier, it gives effect to many of the things that, as I understand it, are quite dear to the heart of the opposition in particular, in that, recognising that government, with its limited resources, is incapable of providing the sorts of protection for important areas that it might otherwise wish to do, it is appropriate that private sources of funds be found to set aside areas which are recognised as important. If people are prepared to donate areas of land in these key areas, it is appropriate that government might, at a much lower cost to government, provide a rebate scheme for these sorts of donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out at the second reading stage that this is by no means unique. We are not breaking new ground here. This type of provision is already in the tax law of the United States and the United Kingdom. I think both those countries could claim to be, if anything, in terms of the Right-Left spectrum, even more conservative than the present Australian Labor government. So there is a precedent for this type of arrangement. It is an extremely valuable addition to this legislation. It would provide a mechanism by which other areas of land which cannot otherwise be put aside because of limited government finance could be put aside at much lower cost to government through such a rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I very strongly urge the acceptance of this amendment, which appears to be an extremely long amendment, but is simply a matter of crossing the t's and dotting the i's of what is essentially a rebate scheme for donations of land. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those greetings are a valuable reminder to me that we are all here, whatever our party affiliations and our party platforms, to serve a common purpose&mdash;to serve the people who elected us according to our own individual aspirations, insights and values. However vigorous and impassioned our arguments may be from time to time, it is good to remind ourselves that we are here about ideas and not about people in terms of those that we are contending against. I might mention in passing, in view of my past experience, it is not always quite clear that that is the case in the other place. I hope to keep that in mind and, if I do not, I am sure others will remind me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge the members of my own party organisation who in the preselection process renewed their trust in me. I appreciate very much the responsibility that goes with that trust.

I am sure that Pat Staunton and Franca Arena would verify that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last year I have had the pleasure of working with Australia's largest health care group, the Moran Health Care Group. It has been a delightful and, indeed, enriching experience. It has broadened my horizons, which were previously in medicine, academia and small business. One of the reasons I chose to work for the Moran Health Care Group was, indeed, the high regard in which I held the group and its chairman. My judgment, I think it is fair to say, was more than justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Doug Moran is a multimillionaire, he does not fit that mould. He is certainly a very astute businessman; he is not afraid to make tough decisions. But there is a compassionate side of Doug which many people have not seen. He has done many things for many of his employees who have been facing hard times. Not only has he not sought reward, but indeed he has gone out of his way to keep it secret in many cases. I know like many successful businessmen he has a lot of enemies, but he also has a lot of good friends, particularly amongst his employees. Contrary to the image put out about most millionaires, he is something of a rarity nowadays: he  is scrupulously honest. It has been a delight to work with him over the last year. I count Doug as a good friend, and I look forward to continuing that friendship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to express a warm word of thanks also to the electorate of Lowe, which gave me two most challenging and fascinating, I think it is fair to say, terms in office which taught me so much about the needs and the aspirations of an extraordinary and indeed very successful multiculture. I think that nowhere could I have been closer to understanding the true meaning of the expression `parliamentary service' than in the electorate of Lowe. It is an invaluable cross-section of all Australia. It provided for me a very valuable apprenticeship for a broader service and a vital lesson in concern and compassion, and the reminder&mdash;which more might be taken note of by the other side of the house&mdash;of the need wherever possible to assist, to beckon on and to uplift the dignity and self-esteem of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me the bicameral system is an essential part of the parliamentary process. I think in seven years time when we reflect upon the centenary of the Commonwealth Parliament we will pay strong tribute to the structure which was put in place by the fathers of federation. I guess we will also applaud the wisdom of the electorate which, although there was the opportunity via various referenda, has essentially made very few changes to the system. It is a unique system. It has built into it, in the House of Representatives, the vital principles of the Westminster system. It has recognised in the Senate the huge size and the huge diversity of this great country of ours, and the essential requirement of the protection of states which is necessary within our federation. Therefore the Senate was modelled on the American pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also remind ourselves that individual states demanded as an essential prerequisite for federation that there should be an upper house with equal representation for all states, and that the Senate should have the power to reject money bills. Without that representation and without that power I think it is fair to say there would have been no federation. Let me repeat, therefore, that without equal representation the two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, could have overtaken the smaller states in terms of the allocation of finances. I think it is also fair to say as a sequitur from that that if there were any serious attempt to change that system now there would be fierce protest not only from within this chamber but also from the general population at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The method of election of honourable senators is not prescribed in the constitution, of course; it is determined by parliament. The only experiments with the preferential system that I have found really proved to be very unsatisfactory. On one occasion there was a majority of 33 to three, which would create an interesting situation nowadays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, I think it is greatly to the credit of the late Arthur Calwell, one of the most respected of Labor leaders, who changed the system to proportional representation, which was a more equitable reflection of voters' intentions. It is true that using a proportional representation system does give the opportunity for independents and minor parties to emerge, and the magnitude of that opportunity depends upon the size of the quota required to elect a senator. That quota diminishes in size as the parliament gets bigger. I cannot refrain from pointing out that the increase in size&mdash;and therefore the increased representation from minor parties&mdash;is a result of the Hawke government changing the size of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1949 there have been lengthy periods in which the government of the day has not had a working majority, but it has not, by and large, led to stagnation or great frustration. Much rests upon the quantity and the quality of the independent contribution. I am sure that if there is ever a gross abuse of power in that regard there is always the judgment of the ballot box to remedy that or, in extreme cases, a double dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for all of us to make the system work and not to exceed that measure of power which the electors gave us. I have to say that I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should consider very carefully before making any legislative changes, whatever his temporary frustrations may be. By its very nature this place is a restraint on the absolute power or the absolute abuse of power by the lower house. The passage of legislation between the houses does provide that pause to take stock, to put to media and to public scrutiny a range of legislative procedures, and also for the Senate committee system to scrutinise and to review. After all, that is the Senate's essential role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to any observer that the real engine room of parliament is this place. This is the place where there is constructive debate, the ability to make sensible changes to legislation and, indeed, to have a very real impact on the country as a whole and upon individuals within our great country. For those who doubt me, I would have said this a year ago. I think I can say without being party political that probably every member of this house would share those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the recent comments from our Prime Minister that this place is composed of unrepresentative swill should be dismissed as the arrogant nonsenses that they are. It is so typical of the Prime Minister: if he cannot have his own way, he takes his bat home and tries to change the game. With all due respect, it is a power mentality associated with his particular faction in New South Wales, and not only the country but, I believe, the Australian Labor Party are the poorer because of that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I would not agree that every change imposed by the Senate was sensible or constructive, I think it is fair to say that overwhelmingly the impact of review in this house is a very positive one. Having experienced the process of review in the other place I think I can say without fear of contradiction, particularly within this chamber, that it is at best superficial and at worst non-existent. Of course, by and large the government does not want constructive input, it does not want review; it simply wants its own way, and power for its own sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always a matter of great pride, honour and privilege to be a member of this august chamber, but perhaps for me it is a little more special in as much as I am following in the steps of two illustrious senators. One senator I do not need to expand on; Senator Bishop left this chamber recently and her contribution is well-known. Her predecessor was John Carrick who, I am proud to say, is my father-in-law. I am delighted both on a personal basis and for the family that the baton has been passed on in this albeit indirect way. I have to say, and I think those who knew John Carrick here would agree, that if I can make a contribution one-tenth as worthwhile as that which he made, then I will have indeed achieved a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it would be interesting to look back at John Carrick's maiden speech, as first speeches were called in those days before political correctness took us over, to see what the issues were at that time and, with hindsight, to see whether they really were genuine issues. It is very interesting to see how many of them are relevant today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, he called in that speech upon the Commonwealth to initiate a comprehensive inquiry into the whole taxation system and its incidence upon the incomes of people because, as he said, `We' that is, the Liberal Party, `stand for progressive taxation and we should set up an instrument which translates theory into practice. This was in 1971, so we have come a long way since then, but plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose. I think most of us would agree that a review of the taxation system would not go amiss even now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said there should be a convention or a conference of the Commonwealth and the states to undertake a demarcation of roles. Very few people here would disagree with that. Indeed, those on the other side have even gone a short way&mdash;and I have to say a very short way&mdash;down that path. It sounds very familiar. He pointed out that we should try to decentralise some of the functions run by government in Australia in terms of the powers of government&mdash;an argument that, clearly, we on this side, at least, would support at this time. It is contrary to what the current government has been doing, which has been to centralise power and control in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also rejected the idea that profit and profitability were not ugly things or that we should try to raid profit all the time so that there would be less and less. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless industry is profitable there can be no industry except in a socialist state.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very interesting to look at what the ACTU was saying last week when company profits started to show an upturn for the first time in living memory almost. The first thing the ACTU said was that we would have to distribute those profits to the workers, otherwise there would be strikes and goodness knows what else&mdash;the veiled threats that we see so often. In fact, what we should be doing, of course, is seeking not only to make sure that the workers are looked after, but in particular to reinvest and increase productivity and our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He addressed the issues of a possible conflict between rural and city interests. I am sure my colleagues in the National Party of Australia will be interested in this. He pointed out then that 70 per cent of all rural costs were not on the farm, but were off farm&mdash;purchase of machinery and vehicles, tax, local rates and, in particular, freight. Again, it is amazing how, in 20-odd years, things really have not changed. He called for a national inquiry into freight costs which constituted 35 per cent of the costs of all goods at that time. I am not sure what the figure is now, but I suspect it is not vastly different. Bearing in mind that that was a speech given in 1971, he also showed some interesting foresight. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenges that are before us in the 70's and 80's are vastly different from those that we faced in the past. We talk about ecology and the quality of life. I do not see ecology as being the relationship of man to his environment. I recognise its importance but not its preeminence. The one challenge confronting this Parliament, the people of the country and the world generally, is the challenge of the ecology of the relationship of man to man. How can we reduce conflict on an international level, whether it be in industry, on the streets or in delinquency&mdash;the challenge is to be cooperative, not divisive.</PARA>
<PARA>How true those words are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that I was proud, not only to be here, but also to be representing the great political party of our generation&mdash;the Liberal Party&mdash;particularly in this year on its 50th anniversary. Looking back over its 50 years it is with great pride that I proclaim the membership of the party, and my absolute and unerring support for the philosophies which have done so much to create a better and healthier Australia in every sense of the words. Although the Labor Party has been doing its best to undermine some of our traditions and some of our qualities of life, it still is a great country in which to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time the Labor Party claims the high moral ground; claims the innovations and the changes, particularly those with a social element, as its own. I thought it was time somebody put the record straight, and to list and perhaps touch upon some of the achievements of the Liberal Party over the last 50 years. I remind the Senate that for the majority of the 93 years since federation, the Australian electors have supported governments of a liberal persuasion. Indeed, for 30 of the last 48 years&mdash;since the end of World War II&mdash;Liberal governments have prevailed at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a few months many people around Australia will join in the celebration of the 50th anniversary. Within those 50 years, a record number of enduring social and economic reforms have been implemented, falling within the liberal philosophy of governing for all people and not just for a section. The Liberal Party was formed within the vivid memory of the Great Depression and a world war, and it was very conscious of the country's very narrow basis in primary industry at that time, and the virtual absence of any worthwhile social security measures to assist and to protect against unemployment and ill health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Liberal governments of the 1950s and 1960s which embarked upon implementing unprecedented social reform policies, unprecedented economic development, unprecedented industrial expansion and great national security. Medical benefits, hospital benefits, pharmaceutical benefits, child endowment, home ownership available to the vast majority of average wage earners, a huge expansion of eduction funding at both school and tertiary levels, recognition of the needs of non-government schools, development of mineral resources, rapid expansion of secondary industry for both peacetime and defence needs, the realignment of our defence and our trade policies towards the USA and the Asia-Pacific region, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two very exciting decades of great vision and great reforms resulting in full employment virtually, low inflation, a record rise in living standards, world record home ownership, expanded education opportunities, and a much greater sharing of wealth between rich and poor which, as Senator Kernot mentioned today, is sadly not now the case under this current government. It is very interesting to contrast those achievements with the achievements of the last 11 years. We finished up with a fairer, a more just, a more humane and a more compassionate society. Sadly, over the last 11 years since the Labor Party came to power, that poverty gap has widened significantly, and the level of compassion and humanity in our society has declined significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very great achievement in our early and vital recognition of the relationships between Asia and the Pacific. It was in those years that those bonds were first formed. It was a Liberal government that negotiated the historic ANZUS treaty, which is the enduring foundation of our national security today. There followed the Colombo Plan, which brought so many Asian students to Australia to train and to become great ambassadors for Australia on their return to their own country&mdash;a policy which is still paying dividends in the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was our participation in SEATO, the Five Powers Pact, the Korean War, the Malaysian confrontation, the stationing of our troops in Malaya and Singapore at their own request, the many aid programs, the Australia-Japan trade agreement and much, much more. There was a full realisation of our future role within the Asia-Pacific region, and our sensitive assistance in helping to bring Papua New Guinea towards full nationhood.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of these very historic achievements, those who seek to portray the Australian governments of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s as being unmindful of Asia's potentials and tunnel visioned towards Europe, and the UK in particular, can only be branded as revisionists of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There remain the most precious of links with those countries&mdash;the great inherited principles of the Westminster system, the evolution of common law and the jury system, and the due processes of law accessible to all people. These links form the very foundations of our freedoms and are vital to Australians, whether they be born here, or whether, as in fact is the case, they form one of the essential attractions for migrants to come to our shores. It is as true today as ever before that, in John Donne's words, no man is an island. All nations, all people are now, more than ever, interdependent. Asia is very important to us, but not exclusively so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, human conflict is not confined to nations; it can be tried and exacerbated in the workplace by self-interests, whether they be management or worker oriented. There should be no place in Australia for class conflicts&mdash;the pitting of boss against worker in an adversarial system. For far too long this has been institutionalised by elements in our society in renewed centralised arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade Australia's living standards have fallen steadily. Unemployment has risen to record, chronic and intolerable levels. The country for so long has depended upon our primary industries&mdash;mining and agriculture. It has allowed our industrial added value industries to decline significantly. We are being out-performed by nations such as Japan, which have virtually no natural resources at all, whose wage levels are higher than ours, but which happen, because of efficiencies, to be much more productive than our industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is not to work longer hours; not to have lower wages or lower living standards, or to coerce workers into working harder by the threat of unemployment&mdash;the very real threat of unemployment, of course. The solution, in the end, has to lie in cooperation and preferably no confrontation between management and worker, with the government simply creating an environment which can ease the burdens of unfair taxes and charges on business, and remove unnecessary regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we give genuine incentives&mdash;bonuses, profit sharing and employee share owning&mdash;I have no doubt at all that the Australian worker will produce productivity and quality products second to none in the world. Sound trade unionism has played a valuable part in Australia's development. There is still a role for it&mdash;not a political role but a reasoned approach to employer-employee negotiations before moving on to sensible enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me clarify my position with regard to the trade union movement. There are a number of trade unions in Australia. Many of these are responsible bodies that represent their members fairly and adequately. But, sadly, there is a very significant minority of trade unions which are not concerned with maintenance of the condition or position of their workers but are concerned simply with utilising the unions as a power base to further their own ends and to increase their own political influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this at its extreme in the fact that no policy can be developed or implemented by this government without the blessing of the ACTU. It is the political master of this government. The ACTU represents a minority of people in this country. It has no mandate to control the agenda of this government and yet that is exactly what it does. Responsible trade unions are very beneficial, and have been beneficial to Australia and to the workers. But, sadly, the irresponsibility of a small number of trade unions has caused enormous damage to our standing as a nation, to our development as a nation, to the economy of the nation, and to the health of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not into union bashing but I believe very strongly that we should encourage sensible and reasonable trade unionism as an option for those who wish it but not as a compulsion for those who do not wish it. We should all, on both sides of this house, try to ensure that the union movement recognises, firstly, that it represents a minority of the Australian population and the only stranglehold it has is over the Labor government and, secondly, that responsible union practices would do a lot to encourage increased membership of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, my beliefs are those of the Liberal Party. They are that we believe in the supremacy of the individual. We do not believe in collectives. We do not believe in lowering the individual to the lowest common denominator. We believe in equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. We believe in smaller government, in getting government off the backs of individuals and businesses, in less power to the government. What an interesting contrast that makes to the current government, which is solely concerned with increasing its interference, increasing its centralisation and increasing its power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in change where change is necessary to improve society. Indeed, that was one of the reasons why the name `Liberal' was chosen in the first place: to reflect upon the need for change in society, but not change for change's sake. I do not and will not, for example, support changing our political system to become a republic. We have had a system which for almost a century has been the envy of the civilised world. It has produced stable government; it has worked well in every sense. Why on earth we would want to change such a system simply to satisfy the strange whims of the current Prime Minister is beyond me. There can be no sensible or logical justification for this, and I will not and do not support any such changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, why on earth would we want to change the flag? To me, the flag represents symbols of where we have come, where we are and hopefully where we are going as a nation. Why on earth would we want to change something which has been there for the best part of a century simply to satisfy the whims and petty jealousies of one individual? For those who say to me, `Why don't we change the flag?', I say to them, `Why don't we change the government and keep the flag?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever we look, this centralisation&mdash;this grab for power&mdash;is evident. In the education sphere, under John Dawkins as education minister, centralisation of control of our tertiary institutions occurred in an unprecedented fashion. I say in passing that I think it was very much to the detriment of the leaders of our universities that they simply buckled under and did not stand up for their freedom and independence more firmly. They are seeing and paying the price now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This grab for power is also evident in the health sector. It is an interesting contrast to compare Senator Richardson with his predecessor, Brian Howe, as Minister for Health. Brian Howe was and remains an ideologue who is and was committed to complete nationalisation of the health industry, and he had the decency to make no bones about it. He loathed everything which even reeked of private enterprise, individuality or freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, we have Senator Richardson who is much more subtle in his attack on the health system. His aim is the same. His aim is centralisation of control and effectively nationalisation of the health industry. Under the guise of attacking a few doctors who may earn inappropriately high fees, he will abolish the freedom of doctors to charge fee levels commensurate with their abilities. He will lower doctors to a common denominator where their fees will indeed be controlled either by the government or by the health funds working on behalf of the government. He will achieve this by getting virtual complete control over the private hospital industry, using the health insurance funds as the agents of the government. The health insurance funds will pay a price: their number may be reduced from 80 or so to about a dozen. I am delighted to see they are now objecting to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private hospitals will finish up in the same situation as nursing homes: they will be private in name only. They will simply be run by the government which will control financial inputs and outputs and, indeed, the day-to-day management of those hospitals. That will be to the detriment of the quality of care offered and certainly to the detriment of the freedom of choice offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other things are occurring in the system which relate to health quality. Among them is the imposition of what are called DRGs&mdash;diagnostic related groups&mdash;which essentially means that hospitals will get paid $X for treating a given condition, regardless of how long it takes. I have no problem with DRGs as a tool; they are a problem when they become a compulsory tool. If the health insurance system is changed so that there will be no option about taking out health insurance as we know it now, we will be able to take out health insurance only for a DRG. If we do not like the DRG system, then we will have to pay out of our own pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that lack of freedom of choice in terms of where we go and the amount we pay that I object to. I am sure we all object to that in terms of removing our freedom of choice. Many hospitals, for example, at present give discounts to pensioners and charge more to millionaires. I am sure that, in the egalitarian way of those opposite, they would agree with those sorts of approaches. Those sorts of approaches will almost certainly not be possible under the proposals that Senator Richardson has put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incentives from those sorts of systems are to cut corners and to send patients home early because that is the way hospitals make a profit. So what we are talking about here is introducing a bargain basement health system. Unless those proposals are changed, I think we will face a number of problems in our health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In nursing homes, for example, the government already has virtually total control and is misusing that control in a somewhat amazing way. The validation procedures, for example, which are currently being undertaken to validate payments made in 1986 and 1987&mdash;seven or eight years ago&mdash;are currently ongoing. Since that time nursing homes have often changed hands but the current owners are being held responsible for debts that may have been incurred or mistakes that might have been made in 1986 and 1987 by the original owner. Notwithstanding the fact that clauses were often written into contracts to say that if there are problems the new owners will be covered, the government has taken so long to carry out the validation procedures that many of those legal clauses are now out of time. We now have the situation where nursing home owners are going broke and owing, in many cases, millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line here is who looks after the patients? Either they go out into the streets or they are taken over by the government which means that the government has to foot the bill. In the end, that is a much higher bill than would be the case if the government were subsidising the private industry. It is very short-sighted. It is undemocratic in terms of the retrospective nature of the process. It is very sad to see that the government is still continuing with this line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potentially, Australia has every element available to it for its success and for increasing our living standards and competitiveness.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as I reach my conclusion, I would like to mention just one more comment made by John Carrick in his maiden speech. He said that he, as a senator, did not stand for any section of the community. The people he represented were not measured by the size of their pay packets, the colour of their shirt collars or the nature of their religious devotion. He said that divisiveness was the evil of politics and he hoped to do something about it. I think every person in this whole chamber would want to echo those sentiments. </PARA>

It is an experience of great pleasure and satisfaction to enter this chamber as both a representative of New South Wales and a representative of the Australian Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this state, which holds over one-third of our country's population, we are blessed by the scope and diversity of its natural beauty and the people who make up the state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I entered this chamber just a week ago I certainly did not feel alone. I felt the support and encouragement not only of my comrades in the chamber and friends in the gallery, but also of all the Laborites and supporters who have built the Labor Party since its inception 103 years ago with the first election of Labor Party members in New South Wales. I congratulate the Liberal Party on its 50-year anniversary; maybe in another 53 years we can expect something from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of the party I represent. The Labor Party is the oldest party in Australia and almost certainly the longest serving democratic party with elected representatives. The story of the Australian Labor Party is really the story of Australia. The party is a broad coalition but its representatives share a common goal&mdash;to pursue equity and social justice. I believe that this can be done when we care for and nurture the members of our community who suffer discrimination, deprivation, isolation and loss of dignity. To borrow the words of one of our Labor icons of oratory, Graham Freudenberg, `The Australian Labor Party is a collective memory in action', and I have a place in that action due to the support and confidence shown in me. </PARA>

As I entered the chamber, I could almost feel the strain and effort of those who came before me, who have pointed the way for me and have still served the Labor Party, the Labor movement and the people of Australia. It is through their effort and commitment that I am here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the union movement's importance in the nation's activities. The trade union movement has played a pivotal role in reforming the economy, but it still continues to play its primary role of protecting workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to acknowledge my enthusiasm at joining the Keating Labor government after its two years in office. I look forward to playing my part in a young, fresh, vital government&mdash;one that is steeped in the traditions of the labour movement but recognises the changing face of our community which gives a greater role to women and our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In thanking my pathfinders, I would like to pay tribute to the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, whom I have replaced. Kerry served the Senate as a representative of New South Wales and the Labor Party from 1975 to 1994, with a short break in 1978.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The spirit of what is good and decent in Australia, the notions of mateship and a fair go, are still the property of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry has now been given an opportunity to pursue his passion for democracy and human rights, particularly in the context of Australia's role in southern Africa.

I wish him and his wife, Julie, well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator for New South Wales, I wish to spell out the priorities that I will pursue. My priorities are clear. What New South Wales needs is jobs. The largest state in Australia and the most economically vital is suffering unemployment at 11.3 per cent. This problem is exacerbated in our young people's unemployment which, in January this year, was 26.9 per cent for those aged 15 to 19 and 16.5 per cent for those aged 20 to 24. In New South Wales there are 118,180 long-term unemployed&mdash;that is, those unemployed in excess of 12 months. An economic miracle has been performed by the Keating government by creating growth in the economy of four per cent while, at the same time, keeping inflation at 1.9 per cent for December 1992 to 1993, well below the OECD average of four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor government has been successful in creating the environment for economic growth, but the state government is not capable of responding except with circuses and the cutting of funding and services to the state's most needy. This has left high growth areas with inadequate roads, drainage and sewerage, and inadequate health and education facilities. People in New South Wales are now paying more state taxes and getting reduced services. At the same time, the state government is compulsorily requiring a policy of intensifying development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor governments were the pathfinders in creating policies of direct government intervention in the Labor market. The orthodoxy of federal governments prior to the war and, essentially, until 1972 was that the demand and supply of labour would adjust as it did with other commodities, and the suffering of those individuals affected was an unfortunate consequence. When the labour market began to deteriorate in the early 1970s, the Labor government rejected that philosophy by introducing the regional employment development scheme and the national employment and training program. In the 1980s, the Labor government instituted the community employment program. This program attacked unemployment at a regional level, while giving priority to the disadvantaged individuals in their respective communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though economic growth is a prerequisite to the creation of new jobs, it can certainly not be relied upon to supply the 321,500 jobs that are required at this time for the unemployed people of New South Wales to provide them with wages and the dignity that they are entitled to. In the financial year 1983-84, Australia enjoyed economic growth of 10 per cent and 232,200 jobs were created, including 113,257 from part-time, CEP or WPP placements. The recent green paper on restoring full employment pointed out that a rate of growth of 3 1/2 per cent would be sufficient to reduce unemployment to approximately seven per cent Australia-wide by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be entering the Senate during the development of the Kelty report on regional development and the upcoming white paper on employment and unemployment. The government is firmly taking the opportunity created by its economic policies to assist the unemployed. We can overcome the shortcomings of the inadequate state government by creating a direct linkage between the federal government and local regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a strong advocate of regional development and local building programs funding essential infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals or long-term industry projects where priority is determined by drawing on the expertise and experience of the local community. A proper regional development policy should be based on maximising the opportunities of regions created by local skills, the local physical environment and pre-existing industry and infrastructure. The policy should also set criteria to compare and set priorities between different regions. This strategy, I believe, is the second part of the answer to helping our unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also committed to providing support for families. In saying this, I want to state firmly that the family is that of modern Australia, not the hierarchical and repressive model of the family advocated by the opposition with a woman's role firmly delineated by her gender and the emotional involvement  of the man limited also by his gender. There are 4.7 million families in Australia. Eighty-eight per cent of all Australians live in a family&mdash;that is, a household with at least one other person that is related to them. In modern Australia, of the total number of families, only 1,908,000 conform to the profile of married mother and father with dependent children. That is approximately 40 per cent of all families. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All families are normal, no matter what their make-up. Love and mutual nurturing of its members is the determinant of whether a family exists, not whether it conforms to a stereotype. I view the changes happening within the family as a positive step. Individuals are changing the family to better cater to their needs and the needs of their family. This is a sign of a healthy society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are more able to take up a role that suits both them and the family, whether it means playing a major role as a homemaker or spending more time in the work force&mdash;or a balance of the two. Men have the opportunity for greater diversity in their lifestyles as well, by taking more part domestically and by opening up emotionally and having closer contact both physically and emotionally with their spouse and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families are becoming more democratised and the members, both adult and children, are having a greater say. This is a good thing.

However, at the same time it places greater responsibility and greater strains on its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Labor government has recognised this need by the introduction of family income support. The government has provided greater flexibility by provision of an allowance for home carers and the increased funding of child care. I believe that we should continue to concentrate on providing these safety nets and providing mechanisms that allow people to more easily balance their roles as worker and parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we should recognise the rights of the family and be prepared to provide even greater support and, further, that the family should be central to all policy formulation and legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes the payment of a bounty on the production of certain fuel ethanol in Australia to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is part of a package of lead abatement measures announced in the 1993 Budget which will complement initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's Environment Statement of December 1992 relating to a guarantee of the excise free status of alternative fuels for a further four years as well as support for new ethanol production technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ethanol can be blended with petrol and diesel to extend transport fuel and therefore reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Its octane enhancing properties may offer some potential benefits towards reduction of lead in petrol as well as increasing the sustainability of the energy sector through the use of a fuel based on a renewable resource. Ethanol also has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that $25 million be provided over the next three years for bounty payments at a rate of 18 cents per litre. $6 million will be dedicated to the first year of the bounty, $8 million to the second year and the remaining $11 million will be used for the third and final year. Where the money apportioned for either of the first two years is not paid out as bounty, it will be rolled over to the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be eligible for bounty producers must be registered under the scheme. Registration will be effected according to specified criteria under the legislation which will ensure that all registered producers will be able to make a significant contribution to the desired competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. Under the proposed scheme, all registered producers will be granted a production allocation which will guarantee them an amount of bounty on the condition that they maintain certain production levels and satisfy other specified criteria. The allocation process is intended to provide existing producers with incentive for capital investment whilst also allowing new producers to enter the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is confident that the measures in the proposed bounty scheme will encourage the establishment of a competitive ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia developed on an environmentally sustainable basis. The Government will also assist in overcoming the technical  and administrative barriers to the use of ethanol as a transport fuel with a $3.94 million Research and Development program over the next two years. That program will develop an ethanol fuel standard, extensively trial the use of ethanol blended fuels in vehicles and develop further improvements in ethanol fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this bill are expected to result in outlays of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$6 million in 1994-95;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$8 million in 1995-96; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$11 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits to civilian Commonwealth sector employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to allow superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS) and associated legislation. The bill also makes some technical corrections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government decided that its own superannuation schemes that were at least partly funded should comply with the occupational superannuation requirements in the SIS legislation in the same way as private sector schemes. Commonwealth schemes that are not funded will be required to comply, in principle, with the major thrust of the controls such as vesting and preservation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the SIS legislation requires that the rules of a superannuation fund may not allow the trustees of  the fund to be directed by another person, nor may any other person exercise discretions unilaterally. In addition the  rules of the fund should not be able to be amended without the approval of the trustees. All these rules have some exceptions spelled out in the SIS Act itself, and some to be provided for by regulations under that Act. The main exception relates to directions, discretions, etc that would affect the employer's contributions to the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the Superannuation Act 1976 provides that the Commissioner for Superannuation and a Board of Trustees share the responsibility for the administration for the scheme set up by the Act, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives the responsibility for administration of the CSS completely to the Board of Trustees. All discretionary decisions that were previously made by the commissioner will be made by the Board from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Finance also has a role under the 1976 Act. Some of the powers exercised by the Minister are to be transferred to the Board. However, other powers which relate to employer costs under the scheme will remain with the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain other powers were exercisable by the Board after consideration of principles issued by the Minister. In the case of these powers, the Act generally has been amended to  incorporate any principles that were issued into the legislation and any remaining discretion is to be exercised by agreement between the Minister and the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar amendments concerning the powers of the Minister are to be made to the Superannuation Act 1990. The scheme established under the provisions of that Act is already administered by a Board of Trustees so no transfer of power from the Commissioner for Superannuation is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise that no changes are to be made to the benefit structure or the scheme design of the schemes covered by the Acts that are being amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the technical changes being made is to allow certain delegated instruments to operate with retrospective effect and to put the validity of past instruments beyond doubt. These amendments are a response to concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The instruments would enable members to continue membership in circumstances where they may have inadvertently been forced to leave the scheme if there was no retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill also amends the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. This Act enables the Minister for Finance to exercise certain discretions to oversight and control superannuation arrangements established by Commonwealth employing authorities, other than the Commonwealth itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the SIS Act, the existing Ministerial discretions would be replaced with provisions preventing Commonwealth employers from establishing and operating superannuation arrangements unless they are able to satisfy certain pre-determined requirements. An added feature of these requirements is that they will impose an obligation on employers to report annually to the Minister in relation to those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. As none of the changes result in any change to the benefit design of the superannuation schemes involved, there is no financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WITNESS PROTECTION BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that the capacity to protect key witnesses is a vital component in dealing effectively with serious crime, particularly organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are numerous ways a person may become a witness. These include being at the scene of a crime (as an accomplice or innocent witnesses) when it occurred or becoming aware of criminal activity and reporting those concerns to the authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the case of serious or organised crime, often it is those persons who have been intimately involved with a criminal activity who are in the best position to provide direct evidence. Alternatively, they may provide information which corroborates evidence obtained from other sources, such as telephone intercepts. They need protection and this protection also needs to be extended to the families of such witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill arose from the Parliamentary Joint Committee Report on Witness Protection. The bill is intended to be the basis of complementary legislation by the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a number of years the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has operated a witness protection program. Programs are also operated by most police forces, including the New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian forces and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. In the case of custodial protected witnesses, the primary protection is provided by Corrective Services agencies in each jurisdiction. By law these agencies have the care and control of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of New South Wales the Department of Corrective Services has established a purpose built high protection prison within the Long Bay Correctional Complex for those prisoners in that State who require a high degree of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PJC Report recommended that the AFP should assume an expanded national protection role. In addition, the Report recommended that legislation should underpin the scheme and that there be improved co-ordination and co-operation between the various law enforcement agencies and their clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Commonwealth/State/Territory Steering Committee was established which identified the key issues which needed to be addressed in the model Commonwealth Witness Protection . The Steering Committee and its Subcommittees made an invaluable contribution to the development of the bill. In this regard I would like to acknowledge the co-operation and contribution made by the State and Territory Ministers and their agencies and officers to the development of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an interim measure, in 1989 the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 was amended to permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to enter into arrangements with the Commissioners of the State and Territory Police forces, the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority and Commonwealth and State/Territory prescribed authorities to provide services for the protection of witnesses. This amendment has enabled the AFP to expand its program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maintenance of the integrity and accountability of the program is of vital concern to the Government and the Commissioner. The AFP members involved with the assessment and placement of persons on the program are operationally a discrete unit. This means that the witness's police case officer is not involved in the decision-making process for placement on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that some of the key functions, such as removal and placement onto the program may not be delegated below the position of Deputy Commissioner of the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protected witnesses may be removed from the program for a number of reasons provided by the Act. For example, they may ask to be taken off the program. Another reason may be that with the passage of time and successful relocation and integration into a new community, they will no longer be in a high risk category. There are other provisions such as breaching the memoranda of understanding (such as taking unnecessary risks with their own lives) or committing offences while under the program. Any removal is subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The witness protection program currently operated by the AFP is for those small number of key witnesses and their families requiring a high degree of protection because of serious threats to their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its operation is based on relocation, change of identity and integration back into the community in his/her new identity, thus enabling the witness to give evidence without fear of retribution. It is proposed that the bill give legislative support to the AFP in the operation of its program. The processes and procedures set out in the bill have been honed and tested by the AFP in the operation of its current program. The bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to enable the arrangement provisions to be relocated in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is to operate a National Witness Protection Program (NWPP). The Commissioner will be able to enter into arrangements with State/Territory Commissioners of Police and Chairpersons of bodies such as the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Independent Commission against Corruption and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to enable protection to be provided for witnesses of these authorities. These arrangements will include the recovery of operational costs. Placement on the NWPP is voluntary and is not to be given as a reward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedures are set out for the placement and removal of witnesses from the NWPP; safeguards surrounding the procedures for the issue of new federal documents; procedures to ensure that people on the NWPP do not use the new identity to avoid civil or criminal liability and to enable foreign witnesses to be placed on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The placement of a foreign witness on the program is a further example of the Government's international co-operation in the fight against serious or organised crime. Such a person may be able to give vital evidence in an Australian criminal trial or need to live outside his/her country of origin pending and following the trial coming on for hearing. Special conditions apply to the selection and placement of foreign witnesses on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paramount consideration needs to be given to the protection of information held by the AFP on those persons on the program, if the witnesses are to be truly safeguarded. The wider the information net extends, the greater the risk that the integrity of the scheme will be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is for these reasons that the usual administrative law review procedures have been changed. Decisions made under the bill will be exempt from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This approach recognises the absolute security requirements of the program. Questions relating to freedom of information and archives legislation are proposed to be addressed by separate amendments to the relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP officers administering the program are subject to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. This means that complaints against them may be the subject of investigation by the Ombudsman. To facilitate investigation of such complaints the Ombudsman will have right of access to the relevant program documents. Where a person is involuntarily removed from the program or where a new identity is removed, these decisions will be made by a Deputy Commissioner to enable the person to appeal to the Commissioner against an adverse decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not have any financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President the more important features of the bill are:-</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commissioner of the AFP is to operate a National Witness Protection Program (NWPP) to provide protection and assistance to witnesses and their families;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it enables the Commissioner to enter into arrangements with approved authorities eg State Police Commissioners to provide protection and assistance and for this purpose the existing provisions in the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 are being relocated in the bill;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it provides the AFP with statutory procedures to govern the placement on and removal of witnesses from the NWPP, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding, new identities and the restoration of former identities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it will enable foreign witnesses to be placed on the NWPP. In such a case, the person will not only have to be approved for inclusion on the NWPP by the Commissioner, but have an entry visa. The foreign law enforcement authority will enter into arrangement for the costs of such matters as travel and protection. Where all these requirements have been satisfied, final approval for acceptance in the program is reserved for the Minister for Justice;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it establishes a Register of persons who are or who have been on the program, which must include certain information including the old and new identity as well as the criminal record of the person, if any;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it provides safeguards regarding the processes for issuing new identity documents and mechanisms to ensure that persons on the NWPP do not use the new identity to avoid civil or criminal liability;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is proposed that the bill form the basis of complementary legislation. To safeguard the integrity of federal documents, 12 months after the bill commences, federal agencies will not be able to issue documents for persons on State/Territory witness protection programs unless there is complementary legislation in place and there are arrangements in place with the State/Territory in question;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Ombudsman's powers to investigate complaints under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 are retained. For this purpose it is proposed that the Ombudsman has a right of access to documents and records held by the AFP in relation to the NWPP.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it creates offences relating to divulging information without lawful authority about the NWPP and persons who have been assessed for the program or who are or have been on the program;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commissioner and the Ombudsman are not required to disclose information or produce documents in proceedings in the performance of functions under the bill, unless it is essential to the determination of the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where in any proceedings the issue of the identity of the person on the NWPP arises, unless the court considers in the interest of justice otherwise, the proceedings must be held in camera and suppression orders issued.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the schedule to the bill includes an amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to provide that decisions made under the legislation will be exempt from the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will briefly outline the changes of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3 is operative from the first of September 1993. It designates Eritrea as a developing country under the Australian system of tariff preferences. This follows Australia's formal recognition of Eritrea as an independent country on the fourth of May 1993. Prior to that date, Eritrea was considered to be part of Ethiopia. This action will allow imports of Eritrean origin to enter Australia at concessional rates of duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments contained in this schedule give effect to the government's decision, as announced in the 1993/94 federal budget, to increase the customs duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene by 0.264 cents per litre. These changes will enable the civil aviation authority to recover part of the cost of aviation safety regulation from the industry. The balance of the industry's contribution will be phased in over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a complementary change contained in section six of this bill which inserts the tariff subheading for aviation kerosene in the table to section 26(1) of the Principal Act. As a result consumer price index increases will be applied to the rate of duty for this product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 of the bill will operate from fourteen days after the bill receives royal assent and creates item 63 in schedule 4 to the Principal Act. Reference materials are materials with accurately known composition which are used as the standard against which like materials, processes and apparatus are calibrated. Access to reference materials at world prices, without the added impost of duty, is important if Australian industry is to be internationally competitive. Most of the analytical standards used in Australia for a range of testing purposes are not produced locally and must be imported. Concessional entry can be best delivered through a new policy item. This approach has industry support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its 1991 Building a Better Australia statement, the government announced that commencing on the first of July 1992 it would phase out the bounty payable on the production of certain textile yarn over the following three years. In its stead the government would introduce from the first of July 1995 a 5 per cent tariff duty on the subject yarn. The amendments contained in schedule 5 put in place the new tariff rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes are of an administrative and technical nature and have no duty implications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment put forward by Senator Coulter has some attractiveness but before the opposition would agree to the proposal he put forward in the amendment, there are some down sides that I do not think have been fully appreciated.

That would bring to account the value of the property at marketable value. The cost base on which we will be entitled to a deduction under section 78 may be very low in some circumstances. Hence, in some circumstances there may be quite a horrific capital gains tax as a result of the differential between the market value following disposal of the property and the cost base which we are allowed for reduction purposes. I would like advice, not necessarily today, on the wider ramifications of the proposal in Senator Coulter's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting the amendments proposed by the Democrats. The package of amendments seeks to introduce a totally new policy on the donations of property in the form of land to environmental organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments have nothing to do with the measures contained in this bill. The amendments are being moved as changes to the division dealing with the  heritage conservation rebate. Deductions for gifts of property being land to conservation organisations have only the most tenuous connection to a rebate for expenditure on conserving buildings. In any event, and without giving any weight to the merit of such a proposal, a major policy decision such as this would have to be considered in far greater detail than the committee stage of a debate on a tax bill would allow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, we would need to consider the proposal in the budgetary context. There is a cost to revenue involved in this package that the Democrats are supporting.

I do not know whether, as Senator Coulter mentioned earlier on another matter, this is part of the budget proposals that the Democrats have put to the government.

As I understand it&mdash;and Senator Watson certainly knows more about tax law than I probably will ever know&mdash;those who are now donating land to these organisations are likely to suffer a capital gains tax impost and all this does is provide them with a rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will oppose clauses 80 and 81. We are dealing with part 4 which amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. During the evaluations of this original bill in relation to the superannuation guarantee certain undertakings were given as to the definition of wages as per the Income Tax Assessment Act. Over the years we have been accustomed in this place to the terminology called `bracket creep' whereby insidiously the effective revenue available to the Commonwealth is increased as a result of inflation. Personal income rises, but no adjustment is made to the tax rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to introduce the term `coverage creep' because this amendment puts beyond doubt the fact that the original definition of the term `wages' has been extended to cover contractors. It is a somewhat unfortunate extension. It comes under this broad heading of coverage creep because, as a result of efforts to ensure that contractors services come under the ambit of the PAYE system&mdash;certainly under the coverage of the superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;the concept of wages has been ever widening. This has lead to some pretty artificial arrangements that I do not agree with, particularly in the building trade. </PARA>

Because of the administrative complexities and costs, a large number of building contractors are asking people such as tilers and other contractors to incorporate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heartily agree with the comments of Senator Coulter. These provisions will clarify that payments made to contractors wholly or principally for their labour are salaries and wages for superannuation guarantee purposes. An employee is defined as including a contractor who works under a contract which is wholly or principally for the labour of a person. A contract is considered to be wholly or principally for labour if more than half of the value of the contract is for labour. It was clearly intended that payments for labour under such contracts be subject to the superannuation guarantee contributions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure a continuation of the Government's policy in the area of telecommunications pricing. It will inhibit the development of potential anti-competitive effects, and will strengthen mechanisms for enforcement of that policy. The policy was detailed in the Government's statement on telecommunications in November 1990, and remains an important part of the measures we have adopted to develop a competitive, world-class, consumer-oriented telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Policy Context</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before addressing the detail of the legislation it is necessary to put the proposed changes in context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing major reforms to the telecommunications sector in 1991 the Government paid particular attention to the need for long-term, commercially sustainable competition to develop in a relatively short period of time. The Telecommunications Act 1991 incorporates an integrated package of competitive safeguards designed to ensure that a dominant telecommunications carrier does not abuse its position so as to unfairly restrict the operation of new entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience with the current regulatory regime has been very positive. Competition between Optus and Telecom in the long distance and international markets means that today's prices are, on average, some 40 per cent lower in these areas than they were five years ago in real terms. Both carriers are facing price and service competition from Vodafone in the digital mobile market. And even in this increasingly competitive environment, Telecom has recently declared a record half-yearly after tax profit of $997 million. It has been able to do so because, as the Government expected, competition has not only lowered prices; it has driven up demand, and spurred Telstra to improve its efficiency and customer service faster than it lost market share to Optus. As a result, Australia now has a bigger, better, more efficient telecommunications services sector. The achievements are a tribute to the company and its workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, the Act as originally drafted has led to some unintended consequences that now need to be corrected in the light of experience in an increasingly competitive market. This is essentially "fine-tuning" of a system that is working well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Purpose of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms, the bill is intended to do two things.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it will remove any doubt that a dominant carrier can offer certain charging options that would otherwise be discriminatory and hence in breach of the Telecommunications Act. AUSTEL, as the specialist regulator, will have a role in determining whether charging options are discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it will enable AUSTEL to disallow tariffs that materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Why the Bill is Needed</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become increasingly apparent that a number of tariffs introduced by carriers since the advent of competition may breach the anti-discrimination provisions of the Telecommunications Act in a technical but unintended sense. Telecom's Flexi-Plans (providing usage-tailored discounts to both residential and business customers for a fee) and Strategic Partnership Agreements (providing large corporate customers with volume discounts) are the most prominent of these, although there are almost certainly others that are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now also apparent that there is the potential for some carrier pricing practices to have the effect of inhibiting the development of competition in telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These effects need to be addressed to maintain progress in competition, innovation and customer benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has consulted extensively with the industry to address this situation so as to ensure that, while the integrity of the package of competitive safeguards embodied in the Act is maintained, there is no inadvertent prevention of pricing initiatives that benefit consumers and that are not anti-competitive. This bill achieves these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What the Bill Does </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemption from Discrimination Provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently prohibits price discrimination by a dominant carrier, except where the discrimination is based on differences in costs. The bill retains the anti-discrimination provision, and recasts the exemptions so that the following types of "discriminatory" tariffs will be permitted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those that are generally available, that is, of broad appeal to customers and potential customers. Tariffs under which a service is available to be acquired on the same terms and conditions by major customer groups, such as business customers, residential customers or those in a class of persons determined by AUSTEL will be allowed&mdash;but those that are narrowly targeted, in such a way that competition is inhibited or the benefits of competition are narrowly focused, will not. This change will, among other things, effectively permit the majority of existing Telecom Flexi-Plan tariffs. There are currently some 2.3 million Flexi-Plan customers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those where discrimination&mdash;even if narrowly focused&mdash;is, in AUSTEL's opinion, justified by differences in the carrier's costs. Some Telecom SPAs would be expected to be assessed under this provision. This approach provides significant practical scope for Telecom to demonstrate its commercial case to AUSTEL as to the cost-justification of specific tariffs. The amendments will explicitly allow broad network cost savings to be taken into account and will provide considerable flexibility to accommodate the commercial realities of the industry;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those justified by the community interest in promotion of universal access to the standard telephone service. This would include, for example, existing community and pastoral call rates offered by Telecom; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trial programs, pilot programs and demonstrations, such as Telecom's current trial of calling line identification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of these types of tariffs will require AUSTEL to exercise some judgement as to whether they fall within one of the above categories specified in the bill. In view of the specialised nature of this area of regulation, and the need for swift action to enable commercial decisions to be made, the Government wishes these matters to be dealt with in substance by AUSTEL rather than the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Additional Pro-Competitive Measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is general agreement within the industry that pricing behaviour that adversely affects competition should not be allowed. The Government considers that AUSTEL, as the appropriate independent regulatory authority, should have the authority to act to stop such behaviour. This is particularly important for the development of the telecommunications sector, which is still in a transitional phase from monopoly to competition. This form of safety net is a logical complement to the broadening of exemptions from the anti-discrimination prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the bill proposes a new power for AUSTEL to disallow a tariff of a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market if it is "anti-competitive". To ensure consistency with the Government's overall pro-competitive regulatory framework for telecommunications, an "anti-competitive" test is defined quite specifically as one that would materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition in a market. This test, which only applies to tariffs of a dominant carrier, is deliberately different from those applicable under the Trade Practices Act. This reflects the still developing nature of competition in telecommunications, and the barrier to competition that would otherwise be represented by Telstra's incumbent position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the new power to disallow anti-competitive tariffs will extend to tariffs that are permitted by virtue of the new discrimination exemptions. That is, a tariff that is exempt from the anti-discrimination provisions, for example because AUSTEL considers the discrimination is cost-related, may still be subject to scrutiny and disallowance because of its "anti-competitive effects".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ministerial Direction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that AUSTEL's proposed new power be exercised in a way that is consistent, and is seen to be consistent, with Government policy. The bill enables the Minister to give directions to AUSTEL about how it is to perform its functions under the new tariff disallowance provisions. Such a direction will be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A draft Ministerial direction to AUSTEL has been prepared under this proposed new provision, and I will be seeking leave to table it at the conclusion of this speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft direction:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">requires AUSTEL to develop, in consultation with industry, a framework and procedures under which it would exercise its powers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">specifies matters that AUSTEL must take into account in deciding whether a tariff should be disallowed (such as assessing the overall effect on the market of the tariff), although this list is not meant to be exhaustive;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">requires AUSTEL to consider whether a tariff is anti-competitive (as defined in the bill) if specified circumstances exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to draw particular attention to the Government's policy on "bundling" of telecommunications services by a dominant carrier. "Bundling" occurs where a tariff contains components of different services (such as uncompetitive basic access and local calls "bundled" with competitive services such as long distance). It is Government policy that a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market should not be permitted to "bundle" telecommunications services where that conduct is "anti-competitive". The draft direction requires that AUSTEL examine all "bundled" tariffs and decide if they are "anti-competitive".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the Minister will be limited to spelling out policies and principles, and will not be able to direct AUSTEL to disallow a particular tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Period for Examination of Tariffs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present AUSTEL has only two days in which to consider a tariff filed with it under the Act before the tariff becomes operative. The new arrangement proposed in the bill is that a tariff for a basic carriage service by a dominant carrier does not come into force before the 15th business day after AUSTEL receives it, or an earlier date if AUSTEL so decides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two reasons for this change. The first is to ensure that a dominant carrier does not introduce an anti-competitive tariff and benefit from its effects before AUSTEL has had a reasonable opportunity to consider whether it should be disallowed. The second reason is to give AUSTEL sufficient time (if necessary) to apply all necessary scrutiny, including application of the criteria specified in the Ministerial direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Matters</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill repeals existing sub-section 184(3) of the Act because its meaning has been found to be uncertain in practice. The new provisions inserted by the bill clarify the Government's policy intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the measures in the bill displace the operation of the general competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and this is made clear in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed date of commencement for the amending Act is 15 March 1994. This is the date on which the Government announced the changes embodied in the bill. This fixed date is desirable to provide certainty to industry, including carriers and their customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Austel Resources</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Administering these new provisions will be a significant task for AUSTEL. It will need to exercise judgement in relation to exemption of tariffs from the anti-discrimination rules; develop a framework for exercising its new tariff disallowance powers; and scrutinise dominant carrier tariffs to determine if they are "anti-competitive".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is critical that AUSTEL be properly resourced, as the success of these measures will largely depend on AUSTEL's ability to administer them. The Government will be providing additional funding for AUSTEL in this regard for the period 1993/94 to 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should note that AUSTEL has proved to be a highly successful regulator of an industry that has undergone significant change in a short period of time. It has managed difficult and complex issues such as interconnection and the preselection ballot, as well as provided advice on a range of special issues, and done so in a professional and timely manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultation with Industry </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been extensive consultation with the telecommunications industry on these proposals. The bill's objectives have general acceptance, and the Government considers that the bill puts in place workable arrangements to implement its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Further Review</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longer-term operation of the price discrimination provisions of the Telecommunications Act, including the question of consistency with the general competition policy framework, will be given further consideration as part of the previously foreshadowed review of telecommunications arrangements to apply after 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 makes changes to the Migration Act 1958 which itself had a major overhaul in December 1992 through the Migration Reform Act. The bill deals mainly with consequential and technical matters arising from the commencement, now scheduled for 1 September 1994, of the majority of the provisions of that Migration Reform Act 1992. It also provides for consequential and technical amendments to the Migration Reform Act and to other Commonwealth legislation, including, in particular, the Australian Citizenship Act. As I said, these are consequential amendments rather than amendments of substance to that other legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of this bill which affect the Migration Act are several fold. Firstly, there is the creation of three new classes of visa to cover people legally in Australia but not eligible for a visa as proposed by the Migration Reform Act. In the three new classes there will be special purpose visas for non-citizens who have a prescribed status&mdash;for example, foreign armed services personnel in Australia on exercises. These visas will also be used to cater for unanticipated situations which require an immediate humanitarian response by Australia&mdash;for example, admitting an otherwise ineligible person to attend a funeral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second new class of visa is the absorbed persons visa, which is in recognition that an immigrant does not always remain so and at some time becomes `absorbed' into the Australian community. Such people will be deemed to be holding an absorbed person's permanent entry visa, making them legal non-citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third new class of visa called ex-citizens' visas arises out of the requirement for all non-citizens to have a visa to legally remain in Australia. These visas apply when a citizen renounces citizenship or loses it through other means. Without the ex-citizens' visas they would, under the present legislation, become illegal non-citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main provision of the bill which affects the Migration Act is to remove the dichotomy between approval and grant so that there is one decision-making process leading to the granting of a visa. The third provision is that protection visas may be granted as permanent visas. That reflects the decision of the government on 1 November last that persons recognised by Australia as refugees under the refugee convention would be granted permanent rather than temporary residence, which was the policy when the Migration Reform Act was enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes some amendments to those sections of the Migration Reform Act which do not amend the Migration Act. They are mainly technical amendments. However, the regulation making power in section 40 of the reform act has been amended to deal with some additional matters, and a new section 41 has been inserted to provide for transitional arrangements in relation to non-citizens who are illegal entrants because of section 20, which is to be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the bill also makes consequential technical amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts, primarily to reflect change to terminology introduced through the Migration Reform Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments, as I say, are basically of a technical nature. For that reason the opposition will not oppose the bill and its contents. But there are some important comments and criticism that I want to make which relate to the fact that the bill is before us at all. I say to those who have listened to my explanation of the main provisions of the bill that they may, like me, find them very difficult to follow. They contain phrases like `ex-citizens visas', `absorbed persons visas' and the like. They are phrases in regard to which the average Australian would say, `What is all of this about?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not opposing these provisions, as I say, they all stem essentially from a pattern that we have had over the last four or five years of increasingly subjecting migration policy and immigration to, in my view, a more and more legalistic framework. That has happened since the major redrafting of immigration policy in 1989 or so. The amount of legislation that we seem to require for the purpose of the administration and operation of our migration policy is a matter for concern and is something we ought to look at in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of the direction of migration policy with regard to its legislative requirements seems to pose some very important issues that we ought to look at in light of the experience we have now had over the last four or five years of an increasing trend towards such legislation. I refer not just to the acts of parliament themselves, but to all the paraphernalia of regulations and semi-legislative provisions that go with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point I want to make is to express again the concern of the opposition that this bill was required at all. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Migration Reform Act which was passed in December 1992 introduced some quite fundamental changes to the Migration Act 1958. Because it contained quite fundamental changes, the government proposed and the opposition accepted that there should be something like a 10- or 11-month delay before the act took effect. So the Migration Reform Act which was passed in December 1992 had as its start-up date 1 November 1993, with the major exception of the establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal which was scheduled to start, and did start, on 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In about September 1993 the government came back to the parliament and said, `We've put a bit of a toothcomb through the Migration Reform Act which we passed in December 1992. We reckon there are a lot of technical and perhaps some more serious flaws in this bill that we didn't detect. We can't give you now all the provisions and changes that we want, so we want to defer the implementation of the new provisions from 1 November 1993 until 1 September 1994. We'll draft all these technical and other changes that we think are needed and we'll introduce them into the parliament early in the autumn sittings in 1994 so that they can be passed, and then all the necessary administrative procedures, training of staff and so on will be put in place so that everything is up and running on 1 September 1994'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the government said when it introduced the migration reform legislation in November 1992, which was passed in December 1992, that the provisions contained in the legislation were urgently needed&mdash;it listed a whole host of reasons to support that view&mdash;the simple fact is the provisions of the Migration Reform Act, with the exception of the commencement of the Refugee Review Tribunal, will not come into operation until 1 September 1994, that is, almost two years after the act was passed. It is very difficult for anyone to accept&mdash;certainly I find it impossible to accept&mdash;the proposition that an act which was said to be urgent at the end of 1992 should not actually be implemented until almost two years later. It does reflect, in my view, yet another example of the incompetence of this government in the administration of its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government produces legislation which then requires such substantial amendment that there is a delay of two years before the start-up date, something is very seriously wrong with the operation of the government, particularly its administration and its legislative drafting. Nothing has changed since December 1992 to suggest that the provisions of this legislation are in any way less urgent than they were said by the government to be then. Indeed, in some ways there is perhaps a more urgent need for this legislation. Yet the government has been forced, by virtue of its sloppiness and incompetence in the first instance, to delay so significantly the processes of fixing up the legislation and then going ahead with its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst, as I say, not seeking to oppose the provisions contained in this bill, which hopefully will lay to rest the Migration Reform Act 1992 and the other consequential legislative requirements without further change, on behalf of the coalition I very seriously condemn the government and the successive ministers involved&mdash;Mr Hand and subsequently Senator Bolkus&mdash;for what can only be described as incompetence in requiring this further amending bill and, in particular, for the delay that it has caused. These delays have some significant implications. They mean, for example, that the very generous&mdash;many people would say overly generous&mdash;judicial review rights contained in the earlier legislation will continue until 1 September this year. That means many people who would otherwise have had, in my view, entirely proper limitations placed on their access to judicial review, continue until September this year to have the existing extremely generous access. Also, it seems to me the government has failed in this period to take advantage of the delay to reassess the judicial review provisions under the Migration Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament will need to keep a very close watch indeed on those judicial review provisions. I hope and expect that in the next year or so, following the commencement of the new more restrictive provisions, we will be looking to see that they have indeed operated effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the coalition supports this bill, but criticises the very serious delays it has caused in the implementation of changes to the legislation and to the administration of the migration policy&mdash;changes which were rightly considered to be urgent almost 18 months ago. By the time we actually get into the implementation of the provisions, that period will be almost two years. One can only hope that we will see an end to this tendency towards absolute incompetence and sloppiness across the administration of portfolios&mdash;a trait on the part of this government that is costing Australia dearly in a whole variety of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a lot of respect for members of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, but I believe that that department is in a considerable amount of turmoil and has been in that condition now for several years. The reasons are many and complex. On many occasions I have sought publicly to obtain the support of the Green senators and the Australian Democrats in this chamber for an inquiry into the operations and administration of the department. The longer the present situation goes on the more obvious it will become that such an inquiry will be beneficial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill we are discussing at the moment deals with a range of matters, particularly issues arising from the Migration Reform Act, and this legislation has arisen mainly because the principal act was not properly conceived. This has been made clear on a number of occasions, and Senator Short in his remarks also referred to that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) said in his second reading speech, most of the clauses are of a technical nature correcting drafting errors. However, there are matters of considerable concern in the provisions of the bill, although I will not deal in minute detail with the way it shows up the flaws in the Migration Reform Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the bill takes the same approach to the Migration Reform Act as was taken to the Social Security Act during the years of the Fraser government. It places the onus on the client to know their entitlements when applying for visas. Clause 15 of the bill is designed so that a person applying for a visa in class X, for which they are not eligible, will be dealing with an officer who will be under no obligation to inform him or her that they are perhaps eligible, or even definitely eligible, for a class Y visa. Clearly the government is wanting to make sure it can exclude as many people as possible from entering the country. That seems somewhat at odds with an aggressive tourism policy, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill makes provision in clause 8 for a special purpose visa to cover a range of people who would not normally require a visa; for example, permanent residents of Norfolk Island, diplomatic staff and various other groups. Under the Migration Reform Act, however, it is clear that every non-citizen requires a visa to be in Australia. In his second reading speech the minister referred to the act as requiring that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A non-citizen who does not hold a valid visa must be detained and is then subject to removal from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that the minister does not have discretion in this regard. As this creates an anomaly the government has decided on the special purpose visa, a move which seems to create some unnecessary work for the department of immigration but which is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not understandable, and is certainly not desirable, is that this government still cannot find it in its heart to create a temporary visa category of this type to allow a few asylum seekers out of detention and to be in the community while their applications are being processed. This is a situation of which the government should be deeply ashamed. Furthermore, in clause 39 the bill expressly states that the grant of such a special purpose visa does not invalidate any other visa which may be in existence. But why would a special purpose visa be granted, as defined in clause 8, if the person already holds another visa?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the bill makes provision in clause 37 for children of visa holders to be considered as holding their own visa, rather than being included on the parent's visa. One cannot help but wonder about the possible purpose this could serve. If the child's visa is dependent on the parent holding an effective visa, why bother with the separate one? Is this merely a means of imposing additional application fees on applicants or, even more seriously, may it facilitate detention and possible separation of child from parent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point relating to clause 55 causes great concern, and indeed offence. The explanatory memorandum states that the minister and the department will be under no obligation, in relation to a person who comes under the operation of subsection 54ZA(2), to provide information about visas, nor to give an opportunity for the person to apply for a visa, nor allow the person to access advice, whether legal or otherwise, in connection with applications for visas. This section applies to people who arrive in Australia without authorisation. No doubt this would be justified as part of our `right to control our borders'&mdash;the attempts to make sure that those fleeing persecution or oppression should not come here without our first having interviewed them `in the queue', wherever that queue may be and whether it exists or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked to support a new form of the old dictation test. In the old days people had to be fluent in English, or in whatever language the immigration staff at the border could come up with. Now we are insisting that those who come here in desperation must be full bottle on Australian immigration law, otherwise they will not be in a position to apply for a visa and they will be either locked up or thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the material with the bill says that it is not intended that this should stand in the way of an application for protection or for asylum as a refugee. But we should note the words in the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person indicates that he or she is seeking refugee status. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again we see that the initiative is to be placed totally on the applicant who is presumed to know Australian immigration procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago when a boatload of Chinese people landed on Christmas Island the department of immigration sent officials to the island to interview the people, and their boat was turned around in record time. We were later informed, through informal sources, that the officials had been careful not to use any language in the interviews that might lead the people to ask for refugee status or for protection. Is this the way Australia fulfils its obligations under the Refugee Convention or portrays itself as a humanitarian country? And there are other concerns. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying previously, there are concerns about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill other than the ones that I have already addressed. Clause 34 provides for the side-stepping of the requirement of the Migration Reform Act that any unlawful non-citizen be detained if apprehended by an official of the Department of Immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of the more interesting aspects of the recent committee inquiry into detention policy. It is variously estimated that there are between 60,000 and 80,000 unlawful non-citizens in this country. Obviously it is ludicrous to suggest that they should all be detained, but that is exactly what the Migration Reform Act requires. It is quite impossible to provide the necessary prison space for so many people, and in the material provided with this bill that is finally admitted openly. I refer to paragraph 79, page 19 of the explanatory memorandum with the bill. So these people will not be detained except for such period as it will take to fill in a new application for a visa to replace the one which has lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for a grant of a visa called an ex-citizen visa to a person who, while resident in Australia, loses Australian citizenship, either by renunciation or by forfeiture, through acquiring the citizenship of another country. I find it extraordinary that a country would grant citizenship to people while they are resident in another country&mdash;although I can accept that some countries may operate on such a basis&mdash;but even more so, that we could then bend over backwards to make sure such people are not inconvenienced in any way by their decision to relinquish their Australian citizenship. The mystery here is not that we should be helpful to such people, but the extraordinary contrast with our treatment of those seeking our protection and asylum when fleeing persecution or oppression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, clause 12 allows immigration officials dealing with visa applications to impose conditions on visas as they see fit. No doubt the minister will want to say that this will be subject to stringent guidelines and regulations. Fine, but the point remains that visa conditions will be imposed at the discretion of the person who is face to face with the applicant. What extraordinary power. Are we being cynical when we suggest that all sorts of injustices could be forced on people by this measure? This is the dictation test all over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short has indicated that the opposition will be supporting this legislation. I might be tempted to quote Senator Hill when he said, `Ah, the team is voting together again; the family of Liberal and Labor are voting together'. I have to inform the Senate that the Greens are not at all happy about this bill. We will not be prepared to support it, and we indicate that now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this bill because I approach it from a different perspective. The bulk of the constituents who approach my electorate office in Perth are in the migration area; they represent the largest proportional number of constituents who seek my office. Those people come to me for assistance in settling in Australia on a lawful basis. They want to comply with each and every aspect of the laws relating to bringing their relatives or friends to this country, not only for permanent settlement, but also for visits&mdash;in some cases for a relatively short time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I approach it from a different perspective. I approach it from the individual who wants to do the right thing by this country and its citizens and wants to comply with the laws of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS>, which was presented in this place some three weeks ago. This bill does not direct itself to each and every aspect of that inquiry, but it does relate to some very important aspects that the committee looked at. The committee made recommendations and suggestions to the government for further reform of this amending bill and the Migration Reform Act overall, particularly in the area of access to the judicial process and judicial review of migration decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was of great concern to the committee&mdash;and I think it ought to be of great concern to the community as a whole&mdash;that the majority of the cases that are currently being heard under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court are in the area of migration. Migration is an administrative law, but more and more we are finding a resort to judicial review, and the judiciary setting the standards for who comes into Australia, who remains in Australia, and under what conditions that is going to happen. I do not think that the parliament of Australia can afford to abrogate its responsibility and allow the judiciary to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Migration Reform Act, which this bill seeks to amend, judicial review will be limited to six areas: breach of procedural fairness requirements; lack of jurisdiction to make a decision; purported decision not authorised by the act or regulations; improper exercise of a power&mdash;this would include the exercise of power for a purpose other than for which the power was conferred; the exercise of power at the behest of another person; and the exercise of power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the case, and we have seen some examples of this even from the judiciary itself. Three other points are as follows: error of law involving an incorrect interpretation of the law or an incorrect application of the law to the facts; a decision induced by fraud or actual bias; and no evidence or other material to justify the making of a decision. Those are the grounds upon which failed applicants can go to the court for decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Migration went further and suggested that there ought to be further amendments to stop what is perceived in many sections of the community as a flaunting of the laws&mdash;both judicial and administrative&mdash;of this country in relation to migration to and settlement in this country. I understand that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, together with the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, is working on our recommendation that amendments be made to provide that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and section 39B of the Judiciary Act not apply to Migration Act decisions. We also suggested that a leave provision ought to be introduced to prevent frivolous and costly federal court applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a salutary lesson to each and every member of the community, and certainly elected members of parliament, to have a look at all of the cases taken so far by asylum seekers in this country. People should analyse how many of those cases have been successful; to analyse how many have been successful on minor points of law. It will be, I suggest, a very salutary lesson to find out that not very many of them at all have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst all of these cases have been going on, individual human beings have chosen to remain in detention in this country, thereby giving certain individuals in the community an opportunity to attack the government. They have not only attacked the government here in Australia but they have sought to attack the government of Australia and Australia in overseas forums as well. I suggest that that is inexcusable and ought to be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that advantage has been taken of the government on every occasion when it has made concessions to individuals in the area of migration. The government has been exploited, and exploited to the hilt, and that abuse has to stop. This amending bill will go somewhere towards halting abuses that have occurred in the past. Late last Sunday night I saw an example of the abuses as I perceive them&mdash;this is not necessarily a government response&mdash;on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Compass</EMPHASIS> program presented by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on channel 2. This program interviewed a former detainee and talked about the problems that he, as an individual, had experienced in detention in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC&mdash;a publicly funded body&mdash;had gone out, researched and arranged to talk with this particular individual and his family about how bad Australia is in its treatment of refugees. What was not made clear at any point during the program was that the individual concerned&mdash;I will not mention his name for privacy reasons, although the ABC was not quite as protective of his privacy&mdash;had made an application for refuge status, had been refused and had been given legal support at taxpayers' expense to make that application. When the initial application was rejected, the individual made an application for review, again with taxpayer funded legal assistance. That review was rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual then chose to return to Cambodia. He voluntarily returned to Cambodia because it was the end of the road for him here. He stayed in Cambodia for a period. He applied to come back here under the concession that was announced in October last year. That concession allowed Cambodians who have some links with Australia and who have been back in Cambodia for 12 months or more to apply to come back. He came back into this country legally and lawfully. He was interviewed as a legal resident in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of that was mentioned in the program. There was a real distortion of the facts, which gives no credit to the producers of the program who put it to air. It gives no credit to the ABC itself, which ought to be maintaining some standards about truth and accuracy in what it puts to air. I found that appalling, as I do some of the other public remarks that have been made about detainees in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little while ago Senator Chamarette made a short comment about a boat being turned around. Since the turn of the century Australia has never&mdash;maybe it happened before the 20th century&mdash;turned around a boat of refugees or people seeking asylum in this country. Senator Chamarette is not the only person who makes that statement; I have actually seen it in print. What is more, I have heard it from an advocate who gave evidence to a different parliamentary committee some weeks ago. I am taking steps to correct that. Those distortions and untruths serve no good to Australia, the asylum seekers, and people right across the world who need refuge in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of statements inflame sections of the community, some of whom are opposed to immigration policies in toto. In fact, some in the community want to send some of the immigrants who have settled here back to where they came from. I hope that, in the near future, reason and rationality will return to this debate before it gets out of hand. I have problems with some of the more outrageous comments made by those who support unlawful entry into Australia. I worry that they might get out of hand at some time in the future. I certainly will be working to ensure that that does not happen. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to make some very brief remarks with regard to this fairly scant report of the Nuclear Safety Bureau. In particular, I would like to refer to a couple of items relating to the visits of nuclear warships and other nuclear operations. Page 2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eighteen Abnormal Occurrences were reported to the NSB for the period 1 July to 30 September 1993 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The bureau said that the majority of those were level 1&mdash;level 1 is not the lowest level; it is an anomaly beyond the authorised operating regime&mdash;and that was the same number as in the previous quarter, but that there has been an increase in level 0 events, which are also anomalies but basically are considered to be of no safety significance. The bureau does not actually say the basis upon which they are considered to be of no safety significance, but I have never heard of a major nuclear accident being reported by a government as being of significance to the health and safety of those people living around it. I have concerns about the increased number of abnormal occurrences and why this should happen. On page 3 of the report the bureau states that, as a result of an emergency exercise prepared and coordinated by the Nuclear Safety Board, it has concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Ansto's emergency arrangements would protect, in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council . . . recommendations, on-site personnel . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that is enough detail. Any report will show some problems with the system. Apart from an average recommendation there should be a little more detail in a quarterly report about what kinds of results come up for an emergency exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps of greater concern is the advice to the Commonwealth on page 4. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSB provided comments to the Visiting Ships Panel . . . on revision of two documents covering operational aspects and environmental radiation monitoring aspects associated with visits of nuclear powered warships . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We are still hearing that insufficient notice is being given to many facilities that are supposed to be on alert when these ships come into port. Much of the information which should be available to communities who live in the vicinity of the ports visited by nuclear ships still is not supplied. So I am very keen to find out when these two documents will be available, especially with regard to such things as change in radiological criteria, port specific population and interpretation of meteorological data, because these are no longer subject to the kinds of excuses that have been used in previous times. </PARA>

One could assume that the only reason many of those pieces of information were kept secret was to keep them from the hosts of the visiting ships. It is time that such things as the visits of nuclear ships were considered in terms of their community implications, and that information with regard to the safety, precautions and monitoring of ships is made available so that people see that there is at least a perception that nothing is being hidden from those communities. </PARA>

<PARA>I have had a brief look at the review of the external earnings targets of CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS. The Greens are very concerned about the ethic involved with cost recovery as a major aim for these bodies. The reason why we are concerned is that the third term of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assess the appropriateness of external earnings as a measure of interaction between Government research organisations and industry by comparison with alternative performance indicators.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the recommendations referred to in the report is that the bodies themselves, in conjunction with the ministers, ought to be involved with setting out what is an appropriate performance indicator. We are certainly in favour of the communities and the scientific researchers being involved in looking at the appropriate performance indicators. We would certainly be concerned if performance indicators are moving to a greater and greater degree of cost recovery and towards how well people reach their external earnings targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seem to be some hints in the document. It is not surprising, considering a great many of the committee members were from ASTEC and that it was an industry loaded committee. But there is some concern shown that bodies such as the CSIRO, ANSTO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science are moving towards being a research and development facility for large corporations. One of the hints that this might be the case is that they are now trying to find some means by which smaller business and industry can also get a look into some of the services operated by these organisations. That is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that corporate requirements will be what drives bodies such as the CSIRO. In many cases the kind of research that comes out of an organisation such as that is something which has been followed along the line of curiosity. If we move only to what industry sees as its immediate needs at the moment, we may leave behind a whole range of options which may be of benefit to Australia as a whole. We question the logic of such bodies as CSIRO ending up competing in the marketplace. We feel that the role of government&mdash;and especially government research institutions&mdash;should be to provide that kind of research that is not available through the commercial marketplace. If we are gearing more and more towards providing a commercial service, the great risk is that those areas of research which would not be undertaken by any other means may be taken off the priority list. That would be a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there a greater necessity for government research bodies to do research and development for private industry? I think that is the kind of question that government ought to be asking. If it is necessary for this to happen, I guess that question needs to be asked: not necessarily how we get CSIRO, ANSTO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science to do the research and development for private industry, but how we can assist private industry to see the importance of doing their own research and development and allow these very important and unique bodies to conduct the kind of research which only government research bodies can undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also particularly concerned that such pressure on bodies such as the CSIRO now means that the kind of research that that body does is skewing in a certain direction. In recent times we have seen a lot of public press releases from CSIRO in relation to genetic research, genetic engineering and so on. That is very concerning. If that is what CSIRO is becoming because of this commercial pressure, maybe it is time industry was less involved and that scientists were more involved in what is needed for the sustainability of Australia&mdash;not necessarily how we can make money out of every piece of research that comes our way. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to support the constituents of Eden-Monaro and, in particular, those who live in the most southern part, in the towns of Bombala and Delegate, and their call for a Mobilenet service in their area. I have received over the past week petitions from this area with a total of 605 names supporting the introduction of cellular telephone services to their area. I am more than pleased to be given the opportunity to present these signatures to the Senate on their behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This isolated part of southern New South Wales has been waiting patiently for a transceiver to be installed on nearby Delegate Mountain. This would give a range of approximately 120 kilometres from Nimmitabel on the Monaro highway in New South Wales to Cann River in eastern Victoria. Mobilenet is something those of us who live in our cities or on major highways now take for granted. However, in Bombala, this service is not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upgrade of the Cann River Highway between the Monaro highway and coastal Victoria has seen an ever increasing number of travellers and truckies passing through the area. With future highway development it will become a major link road between Canberra and Melbourne with an estimated 4,000 vehicles per day. The local business community and the Bombala Shire Council believe that this vital Mobilenet link is essential for the safety and service of motorists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A public meeting to discuss the matter of Mobilenet was arranged by the hard working New South Wales state member for Monaro, Mr Peter Cochran. This meeting was to have taken place in Delegate last month. However, it was cancelled due to the fact that the federal Labor member for Eden-Monaro, Mr Jim Snow, was unavailable. This serious lack of concern for the rural community of his electorate by the local member for Eden-Monaro is only duplicated by the equal lack of concern by the federal government for country areas generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that the reason this area does not have Mobilenet facilities is that it is not commercially viable. I believe approaches have been made to both Optus and Telecom to provide a service to this area. Telecom already has a tower and building in operation on Delegate Mountain. However, it still asserts that it could not justify the investment of a free-standing base station. The advertising for Telecom suggests that everybody gets Mobilenet. In this case, in the words of Telecom's appalling advertisement, Chuckie got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another nail in the coffin of rural Australia and in particular the Bombala area. Services in this town, as in other rural towns, are slowly disintegrating. How can we put a dollar value on the safety of people in the bush? We will soon be left with ghost towns. Towns that once provided services and a business hub for their surrounding areas are now falling by the wayside. Modern technology is a fact of life in the cities but unfortunately this very often eludes rural Australia. Country towns are losing their hearts, their populations and their souls. There is a great concern about the great urban spread and its associated problems, yet we stand by and watch this sort of isolation continue. The federal government has a responsibility to ensure that rural Australia is not forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the Bombala Shire Council, its Mayor, Councillor John Baldwin, and the communities of Bombala and Delegate in their fight to be granted a Mobilenet service. I urge the federal government to take note of the signatures on the petition to the Senate and facilitate the provision of a Mobilenet service to the southern area of the electorate of Eden-Monaro. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I intend to say it. It is just that this is addressed mainly to the activities of Senator Richardson, hence my feeling that what I am about to say could be redundant as far as he is concerned, but certainly not as far as the Minister for Health is concerned. I intend to place on record my deep concern over the role of the Minister for Health&mdash;in this case, Senator Richardson&mdash;with regard to the display of tobacco advertisements in Hobart. Some of those advertisements have quite blatantly been in breach of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act of 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that tobacco advertisements that are less than 1.5 square metres, that are outdoors, and that are not related to sponsorship have been illegal since 1 October 1993. This means that bus shelter type advertisements and ads outside milk bars, newsagents and take-away food shops that are less than 1.5 square metres should have come down five and a half months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two cigarette advertisements that were on display in Hobart are now no longer on display. They were on display for five and a half months after they should have been, notwithstanding photographic evidence that was supplied to the then Minister for Health, Senator Richardson. That evidence was provided in late November, almost two months after the advertisements should have come down. They were on display for a month after I first raised this matter in an adjournment speech in February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were still on display even though, according to my information, somebody from a Commonwealth government department&mdash;I presume the Commonwealth department of health&mdash;visited the take-away food shop where these illegal advertisements were located and spoke with the manager. Three or four smaller advertisements were subsequently removed from display, but the two outside remained. Why did they remain on display? Is it that the Commonwealth department of health gave faulty advice that the two outside ads were not in breach of the act? To me the act is clear. If they are outdoor advertisements, not connected with sponsorship, and if they are less than 1.5 square metres, then they are in breach of the act. In my opinion the Minister for Health is being derelict in not properly administering an act for which he is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question to be asked is: why did the advertisements come down, if they had not been pursued by the Minister for Health? They came down because Mr Anderson and Mr Cumming, who provided photographic evidence to the minister in November, invited the media to come along on Wednesday, 16 March to see the two illegal ads. Of course the ads came down. It was not Senator Richardson who had them removed. It was not the Commonwealth department of health which had them removed. It was the community interest in and concern for this situation which sparked wide media coverage on 16 and 17 March. It seems as if that is the way to get some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do I have to do to get other illegal advertisements taken down? For example, there is a neon sign outside the Ship Hotel in Collins Street, Hobart. The sign advertises Peter Jackson cigarettes. When can the community expect the Minister for Health to order this advertisement to come down? Do I, or a concerned citizen, have to take the minister to court to get him to uphold the act? Do I, or a concerned citizen, have to take Rothmans to court to get it to take down its illegal advertisement&mdash;the Peter Jackson brand name belongs to Rothmans. I believe that under the Crimes Act, an offence that has a maximum fine of $12,000 for an individual can have a maximum fine for a corporation of $60,000. This means that Rothmans could be liable for a fine of up to $60,000 for each offence. I do not know how many offences of this nature have been committed in Australia but if we have several in Hobart we can assume that there are several hundred throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the other advertisements in other parts of Hobart? How many illegal advertisements are still on display after some months of the operation of this act? We have heard much in the past few months about ministerial accountability. This is a question of ministerial accountability. I remind senators that we should be using the term `mandate'. There is an obligation and responsibility to uphold the law. The law that ministers are responsible for administering should not be taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, as we have seen from the coalition so often, the assertion that if ministers are incapable of administering acts of parliament properly, they should not be ministers of the Crown. As I said at the beginning, many of my remarks may appear to be redundant in the case of this particular minister but I suggest that subsequent ministers of health, if the present minister does announce his resignation tomorrow, should see this particular area of responsibility as one of primary responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter should not be trivialised because it was a matter which concerned the parliament of Australia enough to originate, to debate and to eventually pass an act of this parliament. Having passed it, the minister responsible has the mandate to administer it properly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to deal with a matter of real concern and bring to the public's attention dealings in Tasmania's west coast mining tenements which are severely prejudicing the exploitation of Tasmania's mineral wealth. I refer to transactions undertaken by one Francis Corbett and Major Mining Ltd., which is now in liquidation. It is a matter which I trust will be fully investigated by the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the matter is as follows. On 19 May 1989, His Grace the Most Noble Duke of Avram, John Charlton, sold mining tenements to a company named Major Mining Ltd. This agreement was sealed by both parties. The chairman of Major Mining Ltd. bought the transfer with a personal cheque drawn on the State Bank of New South Wales on the account of F.J. Corbett. An Australian Securities Commission search disclosed that one Francis James Corbett was a director of Major Mining Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement between the duke and Major Mining provided for a right to repurchase the tenements in the event of Major Mining on-selling its rights. I refer to clause 6 of the agreement, which was written in by hand by Mr Corbett, the chairman of Major Mining. The clause states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purchaser grants the vendor the first right of opportunity to bid for the repurchase in the event of the sale of the aforementioned tenements.</PARA>
<PARA>In due course, Major Mining's chairman, Mr Francis Corbett, as a director, obtained a registered fixed and floating charge over the companies assets. He did not disclose this in the chairman's report, signed the very same day as the alleged charge was created. Major Mining, in due course&mdash;and, I cannot help but think, deliberately&mdash;went into liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears Mr Corbett, operating under the registered fixed and floating charge, sold off the major asset of Major Mining&mdash;namely, the tenement&mdash;to a new company, Allegiance Mining. This was done without reference to the duke or to the shareholders. Mr Corbett received the benefit in the form of cash and shares in Allegiance Mining stock, a company which was registered on 16 June 1993, but the allotment of shares was only lodged some three months later on 9 September 1993. I understand those dealings have been notified to the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corbett, now with a different christian name and different address, appears as a director in Allegiance Mining, according to Australian Securities Commission records. It appears, on a prima facie basis, that the duke has been duped by Mr Corbett. CRA, a well-known company, now has a controlling interest in these mining tenements. It is interesting to note that CRA was a joint venture partner with Major Mining Ltd prior to the sale by the duke to Major Mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising this matter tonight, I express my concern at the dealings and transactions with a Tasmanian resource which is, I believe, a very wealthy deposit of silver, lead and zinc. The people of the west coast of Tasmania are facing a bleak future. The mining industry is in decline.
