<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking in this debate last night I was considering several of the objections raised by the opposition senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration who were party to the dissenting report on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 . I was commenting on the setting up of a dual bureaucracy and I pointed out that there would now be a separate bureaucracy to manage the indigenous land fund in addition to the one that already exists under ATSIC. I had made several comments about unnecessary administrative duplication and waste at a time when all available money should be used to improve the appalling living conditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition senators on that committee also had very real concerns about the self-funding nature of the very large amount of money that has been put into the land fund. It is necessary that over the 10 years that this fund will operate the economic base of the fund be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans last night commented on the entrepreneurial nature of the funding proposal put forward by the Northern Land Council in conjunction with J. P. Morgan. Senator Evans should realise that it is necessary for this large amount of money to be managed properly to achieve higher returns other than by just investing in land so that there is less risk on the investment of the fund's capital. Land alone can be a risky investment and land values in Australia go up and down over time just like any other investments. People cannot maintain the economic base of this investment simply by investing in land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the long term, the amounts available for land acquisition and management will be considerably less if the government does not take considered action to consolidate the funding base. It is all very well for Senator Chris Evans to denigrate what he calls entrepreneurial action but, unless some action like that is taken, the economic base of the fund will simply be eroded. There must be a range of options considered to ensure that the land fund is managed responsibly. If it is not the J. P. Morgan proposals, which were put forward in conjunction with the Northern Land Council, there must be another range of options put forward. That is what the coalition wants to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have real concerns with this legislation, and those concerns have been expressed by my colleagues who spoke earlier in this debate. We have not been reassured by the hope-for-the-best attitude expressed by the government. It has dismissed our concerns by adopting the attitude of passing the legislation and then seeing what happens. We have already seen that with the native title legislation. That was passed in a flurry of enthusiasm and only now, and I believe for the next 10 years, will the real ramifications of this legislation become apparent. We do not want to see the same long-term effects happen with the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. There are too many generalities and too many unspoken assumptions, and there is too much emphasis on the words `may' and `might'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a genuine expectation that this legislation will make their lives better. Coalition senators have advanced reasons why there is a very real fear that this may not happen under the present clauses and the way they will operate. We will move amendments to ensure that the supposed spirit of the legislation will be carried through in fact, if that is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one denies that land is of fundamental importance to the Aboriginal people, and many government senators have cast aspersions on the feelings of coalition senators, saying that we simply do not understand this. I can assure them that we do. But any legislation to cover that importance of land to the Aboriginal people and their special relationship with the land must be drafted in such terms as can achieve the expression of that aim. We are not satisfied that this legislation is going to move on and do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw should note that there has not been one mention in my remarks of any country but Australia. He seemed to think that we were thinking of many countries but Australia in our consideration of this legislation. I care about this country and I care about the welfare, in the truest sense of the word, of all Australian citizens. In its present form, the land fund bill cannot provide for the land aspiration of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I will be participating in the committee stage of this bill to advocate amendments put forward by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Victorian, I am obviously not as intimately concerned with the provisions of this bill as perhaps are senators from Western Australia or the Northern Territory. But close to my home, at Lake Condah, I have seen the operation of land which was transferred to Aboriginal people early in the 1980s with no real thought as to the long-term economic consequences. I think many of the Aboriginal people in south-west Victoria would be the first to admit that the transfer of land to them by the government has not improved their economic wellbeing to the point where they would be happy with it, and not sufficient thought was put into the drafting and the preparation of the legislation which gave them that land to enable them to manage it properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very real fear that I have with this legislation is that, because it has not been drafted properly and because not sufficient thought has been given to the long-term consequences of this legislation, ultimately it will not work to the true benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is all very well for the government to feel that it has the interests of those people at heart but, unless a lot more thought is put into the way this legislation is drafted and the exact wording of the clauses, this will not happen; and Aboriginal people will be cheated of what they see as their highest aspirations towards the ownership and the management of land. The coalition feels that it has a responsible duty to point out the shortcomings of the government legislation, and that is the reason why we will be continuing to move amendments during the committee stage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 is a very important piece of legislation that addresses the need for all Australians to recognise the import of the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia that our forebears, in their settlement of this land over 200 years ago, did not come to an unoccupied land, a land which in Latin we term terra nullius&mdash;no land&mdash;but came to a land in which there were legitimate ownership rights for the indigenous Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision determined that there exists in this country a concept of native title and that that native title has been extinguished only when a government has issued freehold title or a lease. Those areas of Australia for which there has not been such an issue of title, an act of government, remain able to be claimed as native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens to be the case that in the last 200 years the majority of Australian land and the most economic parts of it have been alienated. Title is issued by government and native title is extinguished. It cannot be claimed. Therefore, to complete the Australian parliament's response to the import of this landmark decision of the High Court, it is appropriate for us to consider compensation and to consider justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those Aboriginal Australians who cannot claim native title because it is extinguished, it is appropriate that the parliament consider a land acquisition fund provided with taxpayers' money so that a board can buy leasehold and freehold land and make it available to those Aboriginal people in Australia who are unable to exercise any claim under native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the fundamentals of this legislation which, in its principles, is supported by every senator. As I understand it, I am the last senator, bar the minister in his summing up, to speak in this debate. I recognise that every senator who has spoken accepts the principle of just compensation and the principle which makes it possible for Aboriginal people of every kind in Australia to have access to land. There was a period earlier this year when there was such dissatisfaction within the opposition parties with the details of this bill, and with the original Mabo legislation that we debated for days last December&mdash;longer than any other bill in the history of the Senate&mdash;that they were saying they would oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After more careful examination by my colleagues, I am glad to say that the principle at the foundation of this legislation has now been accepted by the Liberal and National parties, and the matters of contention are now only on the detail of provisions in this bill. Therefore, there will be a substantial committee stage debate and there will be a number of amendments moved by my colleagues. It will depend on the outcome of the debate on the detail as to whether the Liberal and National parties will be able to support the third reading of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there has been no strong voice anywhere in Australia opposed to the principles of this land acquisition fund. The mining industry, the farming industry, and land owners generally, support the principles of this bill, so do the Aboriginal people themselves who have called for it, as do a number of interest groups such as the churches. I acknowledge that there has been no controversy in the community at large, but rather support for the principles of the bill. The details are another matter and we will come to them in the committee stage debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, it should be understood that this bill provides, over a 10-year period, about $1 1/2 billion for the land fund. In each of those 10 years there will be a drawing down of about $45 million which is about double the amount that the taxpayer has made available in recent years through ATSIC's land acquisition program. This bill doubles the current rate of moneys available for land purchase for Aboriginal people and will eventually shift that money from ATSIC to a new ILC, a board of seven persons. As I have said, about $1,289 million will be put into the scheme over a 10-year period starting with $200 million this financial year. Most of that&mdash;some $800 million&mdash;will remain in the fund at the end of the 10 years and, at that point, only the interest on the capital deposit will be able to be spent year by year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of seven members must include the chairperson of ATSIC and one other member of ATSIC. In all, out of the seven members, five must be Aboriginal. I accept that structure, but I would like to see an additional criterion that there be at least one person with explicit financial and land management experience included in the board. It is for the minister to appoint people and it would be very wise, whatever the fate of the amendment the opposition may move in due course, that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, will be to purchase land, to upgrade Aboriginal owned land, to manage land, and to set up national and regional land strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the three broad amendments that the opposition is proposing. The first is that we wish to have among the guidelines for the board an express weighing of the outcomes to be expected from the land that is to be purchased. We believe that the welfare needs and the economic capacity of the Aboriginal communities which have the land purchased for them should be enhanced and improved. It seems to me to be highly short-sighted if the government is trying to maintain that these land purchases should not address such a guideline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it would have been perfectly possible for the government to understand the goal of that first amendment&mdash;and I put it to Senator Gareth Evans in his summing up&mdash;and to say, `Of course, we understand the opposition's first amendment is not to change the notion of compensation which is at the heart of this legislation, but rather that, in the minds of the seven members of the board of the ILC, one of the guidelines for the purchasing of land will be to try to assess the priorities of land purchase so that they do improve the education, health and housing outcomes for Aboriginal communities, and improve their economic viability.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second broad amendment that the opposition is proposing is that there be accountability by the ILC for the way it puts in place the objectives set out in this legislation. We believe that that national land strategy should be so accountable to parliament that it is a disallowable instrument. We believe that there should be at least one board member who has business or financial skills and that the board in its strategy should be required to consult with the states, which of course have the major responsibility for the management of land in this country. I believe those are all perfectly reasonable improvements to this legislation that the government ought to genuinely consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third, and the last, of the three broad amendments the opposition is putting is that priority of purchase of land be for those Aboriginal people who cannot claim native title under the Mabo legislation or under the generality of the High Court's native title determination. I believe it is in the spirit of the legislation that this land acquisition fund is primarily to exist to enable Aboriginal people to gain land who have not got access to native title because native title has been extinguished&mdash;or for whatever other reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it quite reasonable the we require the seven members of this board to take that priority into account. We believe that there should an exclusion of the possibility of native title on the land that is purchased through the ILC and that land subject to native title should not be purchased except under very exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the government at this final stage of the second reading debate that the government can win the Liberal and National parties' support for not just the second reading but the third reading of this legislation if the government genuinely understands the goals that we are seeking with regard to, firstly, an estimated outcome of improvement for the Aboriginal people for which the land is purchased; secondly, accountability; and, thirdly, a priority for land to be purchased that is not subject to native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard in this whole debate any substantial argument against these three broad amendments. I am aware, though, of an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of two days ago which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund then is a matter of justice, not welfare. Aborigines are entitled to welfare because of the continuing social and economic disadvantage they experience. They are entitled to the land fund as just compensation for past dispossession and dispersal from their land.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that, and maybe Senator Evans will take a similar line with regard to the first of the opposition's broad package of amendments. I accept that the basis of this legislation is compensation. But why not, in the practical decision of determining the particularities of the compensation, have such health, education and housing criteria partly in mind or, as our amendment puts it, the economic viability of the community being improved, being enhanced, as a result of the practical decision about land? I concede that the superior principle here is compensation. We only ask that these other welfare and economic viability considerations be a part of the criteria in the particularities of deciding on land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only urge that the government does understand the goals and does address our genuine concerns. This would be a change of heart on the government's part, because when we announced our position the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, immediately, seemingly without any consideration of what we had said, slammed the opposition's position as lacking bona fides, as not being genuine and as being a stratagem to put up some barriers to the opposition's agreement to the detail of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, as a participant in the party room discussion on this matter, can only say to Senator Evans and the government that that is wrong. There is a genuine commitment by the Liberal and National parties to the fundamentals of this legislation, and there is a concern to have these three broad amendments genuinely considered by the government. Let them be considered on their merits&mdash;not dismissed in the way that was the initial response of the Prime Minister and the minister. Alexander Downer, on the day that we announced the package, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, we are happy to sit down with the Government and talk about the details of the drafting of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am disappointed Mr Keating has already rejected the amendments before seeing them.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, after the second reading debate, which is the stage we are at in the Senate, had concluded in the House of Representatives, a press statement released on 1 September by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, my good friend and colleague Chris Gallus, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Fund provides the greatest opportunity for dispossessed indigenous people across Australia to gain land. How can anyone not want to see the greatest degree of accountability to the Aboriginal people to ensure that their opportunity is not compromised by poor management or lack of guidance to the Board from the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition has sought to strengthen the accountability and expertise of the Board of the ILC so that the maximum available money is available for indigenous people to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has refused to discuss any of these amendments despite the fact that the Coalition supported the Land Fund Bill at the second reading.</PARA>
<PARA>Our amendments are genuinely intended and again I appeal to Senator Evans and the government to take them seriously, to argue them on their merits, and not to dismiss them out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes of this second reading contribution I wish to note that money alone does not bring the solution&mdash;I think we all acknowledge that. If there was time I would have quoted from an extensive article by historian John Hirst on page 25 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 July  where he puts forward four current fallacies, to all of which I am sympathetic. I think it is an essential article that needs to be read by all of us involved with Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to two fundamental issues that I addressed at the beginning of my speech: one is the issue of just compensation and the other is the important right of land ownership. In Australia&mdash;not least in the Menzies era of the 1950s and 1960s, not least in the Liberal and National Parties, and now common on all sides of politics&mdash;we have urged home ownership. We have urged Australians to have a stake in this country by owning part of the land. It was a constant goal of Australian governments through the 1950s and the 1960s&mdash;and remains quite bipartisan now&mdash;that all Australians ought to have the objective of owning their own home; of having a capital asset which is their security, but is also a stake in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far so good, as the person said jumping out of the 18th floor window. The bill before the Senate today represents an important historic step in relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It is the second stage of the government's broad response to the Mabo decision, and a very important element indeed in that response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As so many people have noted, the bill addresses indigenous dispossession by providing $1.5 billion over 10 years to set up a self-sustaining fund to provide land for economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits. The government is very conscious of the need for that land so granted and vested to be managed in an effective manner. The corporation that is proposed to be established to administer all this will therefore carry out the equally important function of promoting and supporting the sustainable management of indigenous held land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those senators from the government ranks who took part in the debate&mdash;Senator Coates, Senator Cooney, Senator Forshaw and Senator Chris Evans&mdash;and who made their normal constructive and thoughtful contributions. As to the Democrats, I thank Senator Kernot and Senator Woodley for their very thoughtful contributions. I notice that Senator Woodley in particular brought home just how recent some of the instances of dispossession have been. Senator Kernot expressed her party's concerns about the sustainability of the fund. That is an area where we do need to make sure we get it right and we will no doubt be discussing that in more detail in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Greens are concerned, I thought Senator Chamarette's speech was a rather unduly harsh judgment on the bill, particularly her criticisms of the level of funding. But at least it can be said that the Greens have some genuine appreciation of what the bill is about in terms of the significance to be attached to land ownership for its own sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the opposition is concerned&mdash;although we noticed some mellowing of the opposition position in the course of this debate, no doubt reflecting the dilemma that is being experienced, having moved from outright opposition previously expressed to the present position of support with significant amendments&mdash;the dilemma seems to be that, as so often with the opposition, we have a bit of a mixture of those who are more thoughtfully and constructively inclined on these issues and those who are less so. We have a bit of a mixture of the redneck `Why are you throwing more money away?' kind of response from some quarters, but a degree of social concern no doubt genuinely held from others on the opposition benches.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles, for example, made a very impassioned speech on health, education and issues of that kind. They are acutely important issues which the government frankly acknowledges need to be systematically and comprehensively addressed, but they are not what this bill is about. We acknowledge the problems that face indigenous people entitled to welfare. More needs to be done in the areas of indigenous health, housing, education and employment. However, programs directly relating to these areas and to improving them are already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While gains have been made, we recognise that there is still a long way to go; but we are doing our best to address them. What we do say is that it is not only through welfare programs that these issues can be addressed, but we have to get to the root cause of the poverty and disadvantage of indigenous people. That continues to be, to a very significant extent, their sense of dispossession and their resulting marginalisation from the social, cultural and economic life of this country. The main purpose of this bill continues to be to address that need&mdash;to return land in some reasonable way to indigenous people and, through that, give them access to the social, the cultural, the economic and the psychological support base that is necessary for true self-determination. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we say is that without land and without the justice that is associated with vesting some land back in indigenous people, any improvements in the socioeconomic status of indigenous people will be costly and extremely limited&mdash;as well as still having a whiff of paternalism about them. So what we say, and say again and again, is that to provide the means by which indigenous people can acquire land is not just more of the same, as is being sought from other sources, but is providing something much more fundamental: it is providing justice. The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 17 October put it very well when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To demand, as the Opposition does, that land purchased under the new fund be used to improve Aboriginal welfare is to confuse these two principles&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of welfare and justice. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also to deny that Aborigines regard their acquisition of land as a good thing in itself.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that is not a position shared by all opposition members who have spoken, but it is a recurring theme and it is one that goes to the heart of what this bill is about. We will obviously need to debate it further before this bill is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of further debate on the bill, it is proposed that we defer the committee stage until this afternoon to enable some more discussions to take place between the parties to see if we can find some common ground on some of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to describe in outline what the government's approach will be to the committee stage. There are some policy issues which are absolutely at the heart of the bill as it is constructed and on which we simply cannot accommodate amendments. We will identify those as we go through the bill. Equally, on the financial provisions&mdash;except perhaps at the margin; we will need to debate that further&mdash;we can, for fiscal responsibility reasons, make no significant changes to the legislation in that respect. That has to be well understood, particularly by the Greens, who have been advocating massive increases in expenditure in addition to that which is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a third category of possible amendments: those which do not go to the heart of the policy of the bill or to the heart of the financial arrangements of the bill but which are aimed at various ways of improving the bill, making it work better and better reflect the aspirations which, at the end of the day, it may be we all share. There are some amendments on the opposition's list which might conceivable fall into that category. There are certainly some on the Greens' list which fall into that category. And there are some amendments on the Democrats' list which, on the face of it, have the potential for some reasonable discussion of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach is simply to respond reasonably and persuasively, I hope, to every amendment that anyone wants to bring forward. Frankly, while there is no room for manoeuvre on basic policy positions, nor on basic financial issues, there may be some room for discussion and amendment in that residual area. We could adopt a very hard-nosed approach to this and say, `Go jump in the lake. See you in the House of Representatives and then see you back here in three months time.' That is a course not without its attractions, given the obvious support that this particular legislation has in the community at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the second reading debate on the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 was adjourned last night I had just mentioned that the bill had been sent for consideration by a Senate committee. During the course of that consideration a number of important issues were brought before the committee by people who sent in submissions. Amongst those issues were the extent to which Australia Post is deregulated, price determination of postal services and the maintenance of competitive neutrality, the balance between community service obligations and profit making within the postal system, and the boundary of reserved postal services, together with the relationship between document exchanges in Australia Post. It was with those particular issues in mind that the report of the committee was brought before the Senate. Also, many other very interesting matters were brought forward by those people who gave evidence before the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the extent to which Australia Post is deregulated, in submissions before the committee and in evidence to the committee, industry representatives called for even greater competition by broadening the scope of the bill and reducing the range of reserved postal services. In response to this matter Australia Post and the Communications Workers Union cautioned that any recommendations being made to extend the legislation should be monitored so that the recommendations did not go past the government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry representatives also raised concerns regarding the optimal point of interconnection between private mail organisations and the postal services market. It was pointed out to the committee that the bill exposed interstate line haul steps to competition but not the intrastate line haul or distribution. Mayne Nickless in particular viewed the intrastate work as the component of total costs most likely to benefit from competition and argued, therefore, that this segment be opened to competition. Naturally enough, Australia Post representatives recommended that intrastate line haul not be opened to competition in order to maintain clarity and simplicity in the Australia Post price structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the price determination of postal services and the maintenance of competitive neutrality, industry emphasised the need to ensure that Australia Post services which were exposed to competition did not accrue any ongoing advantage via cross-subsidies from the remaining protected services. Mayne Nickless also submitted to us at the hearing that Australia Post was entering the competitive market with an entrenched advantage due to some very strong legislative rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess one of the most debated areas is the balance between community service obligations and profit making within the postal system. As Senator Bolkus said in his second reading speech in clarifying the government's position, the government's ongoing support of community service obligations was one of its key arguments in restricting the level of competition to which Australia Post is exposed. In order to maintain uniform pricing and universal access to postal services, the government reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining many of Australia Post's activities as a reserved service. Even those of us on this side of the chamber are well aware of those community service obligations. As a matter of fact, I am one of the recipients of that community service obligation in that I, too, have roadside delivery of my mail at home and I am aware of Australia Post's community service obligation to people throughout Australia. So the balance between community service obligations and profit making within the postal system is an issue which must be looked at very carefully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht can draw his own conclusions. In talking about profit making within the postal system, Australia Post seems to be doing very well at present. Maintaining that balance between those community service obligations and profit making within the department is something that we certainly took into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most industry groups expressed concern that the proposed legislation failed to clarify the boundaries of reserved postal services. In particular, we had evidence from Streetfile&mdash;which, I might say, came under some concerted attack by government members of the committee. But even Streetfile, in its submission to the committee, acknowledged that it was very much aware of Australia Post's community service obligations to deliver a letter and it works within that component of Australia Post's business. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that none of them are here but I guess that is because their position is not strong enough to defend. Streetfile submitted that there is an arbitrary inconsistency within the bill with regard to the packaging of magazines, books and catalogues. According to Streetfile, the bill allows private mail organisations to deliver magazines and books in opaque packages but not catalogues or leaflets, which must be sent in transparent packaging. Streetfile was at pains to tell us that it felt that that was an inconsistency in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even more importance is the relationship between document exchanges and Australia Post. I do not know whether I have generated some interest from Senator Murphy here but I am pleased to see that he is here, as he was part of that committee. In general, industry groups welcomed the government's recognition of the services provided by document exchanges&mdash;something which had not been officially recognised in the past. However, they were opposed to the provision which prevents couriers acting as third parties transporting material between document exchanges and client companies. Clause 11 of the bill allows couriers to perform such a role only when they are delivering to an Australia Post office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard evidence from Ausdoc, the major document exchange in Australia. It is a company which employs some 560 people and uses a significant number of subcontractors. Ausdoc was concerned that document exchange business also includes courier business, which comprises more than 50 per cent of its business operations. Ausdoc, for the record, has in excess of 15,000 document exchange members and operates more than 400 exchanges throughout Australia, including many in country and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When asked by some members of the committee how the company fulfils any community obligations at all, Ausdoc's representatives said that the company serves something like 90 per cent of the population. It does not include a lot of very small, remote and more sparsely populated areas, but the document exchange was not set up for that purpose. It was designed to be a speedy, daily service&mdash;a same day service for city businesses in many instances&mdash;and always gave a very prompt and secure service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, when lawyers, accountants, insurance companies and so on used Ausdoc, it did not carry many documents. Obviously the volume of business and the number of documents that it had to carry are directly related to the number of members of the exchanges, and those numbers have increased dramatically. Years ago, when the exchanges first started, it was very easy for a staff member to go to the exchange to pick up a few envelopes or documents and take them back to the office. However, now with the big increase in the use of document exchanges, often the volume of documents is too much for a person to carry, so for those reasons bundles of documents are carried by courier to the various businesses. Talking about the document exchanges and using post offices, most only use a DX number anyway, so it will involve extra work and costs for businesses to use document exchanges if this bill passes as it is currently set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area about which Ausdoc was particularly concerned was the definition of an organisation. The bill does not treat a company and its subsidiaries as a single body; it treats state government departments as separate organisations. Ausdoc noted that the implication is that, given that Australia Post has a reserve on mail services between organisations, private contractors are limited to providing services within an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position is that, while the bill seeks to clarify which services and types of mail are not reserved to Australia Post&mdash;for example, catalogues and leaflets&mdash;the effect of the bill should not be to restrict current practices. To this end, the coalition will move amendments to ensure that there is no inconsistency between the current practices and the clarification of Australia Post's reserve services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to contracting out and document exchanges, industry participants who spoke to the committee expressed concern that the bill does not go far enough, because document exchanges will not be permitted to provide end-to-end services between individual members' addresses or exchange services. Ausdoc, which is a national document exchange service, expressed concern that provisions applying to document exchanges and internal mail will reduce its ability to continue to provide the current level of service. We think there is sufficient concern to warrant amendments to the bill to ensure that the current practices and services provided by document exchanges are not restricted and that the work that they currently carry out will be able to be continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final concern in the minority report of coalition senators referred to postal services in rural and remote areas. As I said earlier, my concern is that rural and remote areas should continue to receive at least an adequate postal service through the community service obligations. This bill provides an opportunity for the government to expand Australia Post's postal services, through its community service obligations, to customers in rural and remote areas and communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill, the government has chosen not to follow through with the Industry Commission's recommendation that when roadside delivery is only once a week, this service should be expanded to a minimum of two mail deliveries per week. In 1992 just over 3,000 households, or 0.1 per cent of all households, did not receive at least two roadside mail deliveries a week. While that does not seem a large number throughout Australia&mdash;and I concede that it is not a large number&mdash;for the more than 3,000 households that are not in receipt of mail once a week, it certainly is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government's decision not to adopt the recommendation sits very oddly with its claim in the 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS>: `Every effort is made to provide at least two services per week to rural householders, even in the most remote areas.' I do not think that is too much to ask. For those of us who are used to receiving at least five mail services per week, it is very hard to visualise how difficult it would be to receive only one. It is difficult for those people living in rural and remote areas, involved in primary industry or isolated because of their residence. They have every right to be able to conduct their business in a normal way and in a normal fashion by receiving at least two mail services per week. To this end, the coalition will move amendments to make sure that this takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After receiving the submissions and hearing the evidence, the committee has produced both a majority report and a minority report which reflect differing points of view. The coalition will be moving amendments when the bill comes to the committee stage. Those amendments reflect the concerns that were expressed to us by people who are involved in the industry. In most cases, we are not asking for any increase in the current services that are available to people who are operating in competition with Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to make sure that the current practices that exist are not restricted by this bill; in other words, that it does not make it more difficult for people operating under the current guidelines to continue with their business. I speak particularly in relation to Ausdoc, Streetfile and people who gave evidence to our committee. These matters will be debated at length in the committee stage. We certainly look forward to that debate when it takes place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief comments in relation to the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994. This bill is designed to encourage competition in some areas of postal services while ensuring the maintenance of some reserved services for Australia Post. The bill also contains provisions to enhance reporting mechanisms to improve accountability. I believe that in this instance the presentation to the postal industry was more a case of, `You accept something a little less draconian or we'll put something worse in.' That was the basis upon which many people ended up agreeing to a system which nobody is particularly happy with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson is concerned about the lack of postal services in rural areas. However, the general doctrine of the coalition is based on the user pays principle&mdash;privatisation and corporatisation. If we extend that to the limit and we continue to eat away at a government provided service which has equity and access built into it, it is inevitable that the service will degenerate to one of user pays. The service will be very inequitable and access to it by many people across Australia will be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have serious concerns about the rationale behind this push for increasing competition for some of the services currently provided to the community by government enterprises. Surprisingly, the opposition has not been critical of the government for not going far enough in this bill, citing the Business Council's call for the Hilmer report proposal to expose government enterprises to competition as being the top priority for economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that both the government and the opposition are committed to this competition policy and this commitment is often pursued at the expense of proper service standards for the community. A classic example at the moment is the work being done through the Council of Australian Governments on a review of Commonwealth-state service provisions. The review is largely being undertaken by Treasury officials from the Commonwealth and the states. It is a telling fact and is indicative of the lack of commitment by the ALP or the opposition parties to a qualitative assessment of services in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In sectors such as education and health, as well as communication, decisions based on narrow economic criteria are the norm. At the state government level, particularly in my state of Western Australia, governments close down schools in the name of better economic management without considering the impact of such a closure on the local communities. This is particularly important in rural areas where the local school is often an important focus for many community activities and assists in maintaining connections between remote families. If, however, there are not sufficient students at the school according to the bean counters in the education department or the Treasury, the schools are forced to close down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous examples where this blind adherence to economic fundamentalism or competition policy is resulting in great costs to both the community and to many families and individuals in those communities. The potential implications of this bill and also of the opposition amendments are of concern in this regard as they are continuing this push for greater involvement of the private sector in service provision and of a reduction in public sector services on the basis of economic cost cutting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an inevitable consequence in the push for privatisation and corporatisation that in order to sell off more and more of the farm we have to sell off the more profitable and marketable sectors. It is inevitable that what is left under government funding becomes less competitive in comparison to those areas which have been sold off. The more we do this, the more we leave government open to an unfavourable comparison and push government sectors into becoming a mirror image of the private sector. This ignores the fact that the reason there are government services is that there are some things that only governments can provide. The marketplace does not produce the access and equity principles by itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other implications that I do not think have been thought out well enough in the deregulation of courier deliveries. There are already numerous examples within the city of Perth of couriers on bicycles and other forms of transport who, to speed things up, grab hold of the back of buses or engage in fairly dangerous delivery methods in order to be able to make money. The rates and conditions of those couriers are very low because it is a very mobile employment sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that what we will get here is an informal economy under the guise of competition, such as that pursued by the people one sees in any suburb delivering leaflets for very low rates of pay. Basically, we are getting a black economy of below award rates for people working at exploitative rates in order to provide so-called competition to the government services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Democrats have proposed a series of amendments in relation to performance standards. The Greens will support these amendments as we feel that they provide a greater guarantee of proper service to the community than is available under the government's bill or under the opposition amendments. In that context it is pleasing to see that the Democrats' amendment incorporates a role for the Auditor-General in determining the extent to which Australia Post meets the prescribed performance standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that the Democrats have proposed an amendment that will, in part, avoid the ludicrous situation that would have arisen as a result of the government's bill where newspapers, magazines, catalogues or leaflets would have had to be wrapped in plastic. If we think about the number of these items delivered per day, per week, per month to millions of people in Australia, we quickly come to realise that there would be millions of unusable, torn plastic packets. That material would end up on the garbage tip and cause local councils huge problems and incur them in great costs. Therefore, we are pleased to see that amendment because we had already expressed a similar horror to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disposal of plastic is already a huge problem for this country, and we certainly do not need that problem exacerbated as a result of a government initiative that was not properly thought through. It is another classic example of the narrow sectoral approach to public policy that had dominated this government's term of office. Structures must be put in place to facilitate interdepartmental scrutiny of all proposed legislation and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, however, whilst the Greens will be supporting the amendments proposed by the Democrats in order to improve a bill which we do not accept in principle, we will oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 makes a number of changes to the operation of the postal system in Australia. Yet despite that fact if one could summarise this legislation it would be to say that it is more notable for its omissions and for what it does not do than for what it does do and for the changes that it makes. That reflects very poorly on this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, various government ministers go around this country saying, `We need a more competitive economy. We need to make our economy, our businesses and our productive and distribution processes much more competitive so that we can compete in the international marketplace and give our domestic economy much greater potential for wealth creation.' In a number of areas the government has introduced deregulation to improve competition. The ones that readily come to mind are the deregulation of the financial system and the deregulation of wheat marketing, and there are a number of other areas. But every time an issue of deregulation comes up that impacts on some of the union mates of those opposite, that issue hits a brick wall. Government members utterly refuse to proceed with deregulation when it is against the interests of their union mates. Of course, that is the achilles heel of this government. That is its weakness and that is why we find that, despite the government's claims, the economy of Australia is not performing to its optimum level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time government members come to an important area of deregulation that impacts on their mates, they refuse to proceed. That is clearly evident in areas like the labour market and industrial relations, where further reforms are necessary, and it is reflected in this area of the postal services of Australia, as contained in this legislation. That is the great failure of this government and it is a failure that is reflected in this legislation. It is a significant failure because it is contrary to the recommendations of the Hilmer report, which was released at the end of last year and which advocated increasing competition, particularly with regard to government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers in this government&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the Premiers Conference in Darwin&mdash;have been lecturing state governments on what they ought to be doing with regard to state government instrumentalities such as electricity authorities and other state government instrumentalities to make them more commercial and competitive and to provide better service and pricing for the private sector. Yet when it comes to one of their own instrumentalities, they are not prepared to do what is necessary in that regard. Of course, I am referring to Australia Post. This legislation fails in that it is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Hilmer report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also fails in that it does not implement the recommendations of the Industry Commission. This government asked the Industry Commission to inquire into postal services. The Industry Commission undertook that detailed examination and came down with specific recommendations. In this legislation, which represents the government's response to the Industry Commission report, the government has failed to pick up a number of the significant recommendations of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of its general approach and rhetoric, this legislation fails. In terms of its response to the Hilmer report, this legislation fails. In regard to its response to the very specific Industry Commission report inquiry into postal services, this legislation fails. It was in part a result of that that this legislation was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for examination and report. Senator Ferguson, Senator Panizza and I are members of that committee and, therefore, have comments to make with regard to the findings of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the specific features of the bill: it reaffirms Australia Post's community service obligations to provide a letter service in Australia and a letter service that connects to overseas countries. It makes some amendments to the exemptions to Australia Post's reserved services. It introduces a requirement by the minister to have regard to movements in the CPI when approving or disapproving changes to the rate of postage for standard postal articles, as determined by the board. It also introduces a new part which contains some enhanced accountability and reporting provisions with regard to safeguarding the confidentiality of mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are a number of shortcomings with this legislation. They have been raised by particular members of the community and were highlighted in the Senate committee's inquiry. Among those concerns are: the extent to which Australia Post is deregulated by this legislation; the issue of price determination of postal services and the maintenance of competitive neutrality; the balance between community service obligations and profit making within the postal system; the boundaries of the reserved postal services; the relationship between document exchanges and Australia Post; the definition of an organisation; and the definition of a letter. They were particular matters that were looked at in some detail by the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to international postal services, this legislation removes from the definition of services which are reserved to Australia Post&mdash;those services over which Australia Post retains a monopoly&mdash;the carriage of letters between Australia and places outside Australia. But Australia Post retains the exclusive right to carry letters within Australia, irrespective of their origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we in the opposition welcome that partial deregulation of international mail services, we are concerned about the continuing determination of the government to maintain the monopoly over the domestic carriage of international mail. It needs to be remembered that international mail represents only about six per cent of Australia Post's total revenue, while the domestic addressed letter service provides 55 per cent of its total revenue. So for the government to have gone that little bit further and totally deregulate the international mail service would not have been overly onerous in terms of its impact on Australia Post's revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more important are the changes which this legislation makes to the exceptions to reserved services generally. The most important of those is the exception of the carriage of letters within Australia for any charge or fee which is set at a minimum of four times the rate for a standard postal article. Currently, private sector mail operators can carry mail that weighs at least 500 grams and for which they charge a fee of $4.50 per item. This legislation reduces that monopoly which Australia Post has on any letter that weighs less than 500 grams and for which there is a charge of less than $4.50 per item. It reduces that weight requirement to 250 grams and reduces the fee to $1.80; that is, four times the current standard letter rate of 45c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is certainly some improvement on the current situation. It does introduce a degree of greater competition, but it falls well short of the recommendation of the Industry Commission. In fact, the preferred recommendation of the Industry Commission was that the weight limit be reduced to 250 grams and that the price of a postal item be reduced to the current amount charged for a standard letter&mdash;45c. The preferred option for the Industry Commission in its recommendations to the government was that there be virtually open competition with regard to standard letters in the postal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even the Industry Commission recognised that that was a bit too much for this Labor government to swallow and that its rhetoric about introducing greater competition and deregulation would never be matched by its performance if the Industry Commission were to provide the government with only that recommendation. So the Industry Commission provided the government with a fall-back position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fall-back position was that the weight of a postal item which would be subject to competition from the private sector be reduced to 250 grams&mdash;that was in its preferred option as well&mdash;but that the fee to be charged be reduced to $1.20 from 1 January 1994 and thereafter progressively reduced at a rate of 10c a year for five years until the minimum rate charged whereby private sector firms could provide a postal service would be 70c. That would still be some 35c above the minimum charge that Australia Post could apply, and thereby there would still be a significant gap between the minimum charge that private sector postal service providers could charge and what Australia Post could charge. There would still be a significant degree of protection for Australia Post's monopoly. Nevertheless, this would move us much more towards a competitive and efficient system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission recommended this on the basis of very sound evidence. The New Zealand Postal Commission provided evidence to the Industry Commission that the current margin which it has, of 35c, is quite adequate for it to be able to compete against those in the private sector who want to provide mail services. Seventy cents is the charge at which private sector operators can enter the market in New Zealand as against, as is the case in Australia, the current standard letter rate of 45c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That margin is provided in New Zealand. The New Zealand Postal Corporation told the Industry Commission that it provided an adequate degree of protection against the private sector; yet, in Australia, the government would not accept that margin. In fact, in this legislation the minimum charge which the private sector must offer for a standard letter is $1.80. That fee is four times the standard letter rate offered by Australia Post, despite evidence from New Zealand that 35 cents would provide an adequate degree of protection for its core letter service from potential competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are effectively seeing the total exclusion of any private sector participation in the delivery of normal letters. That will have cost consequences for Australian business. As I said earlier, this government goes around touting itself as a government that wants to see Australia's economy operate as efficiently as possible, and wants to see our cost structure reduced so that we can become more and more internationally competitive&mdash;and that is important. If Australia is going to increase its export earnings, and if Australia is going to replace more and more of its imports with goods and services produced in Australia, it is essential that we have to introduce much more effective competition into our economy to reduce our cost structure and thereby reduce prices that the providers of those goods and services charge their customers. At the moment we are simply off the pace; we are falling behind the international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that arises in relation to this legislation concerns the delivery of catalogues and leaflets. The current blanket exception from reserved services for catalogues and leaflets is to be removed and is to be replaced by an exception for unenclosed catalogues or leaflets; that is, catalogues or leaflets that are distributed loosely to post boxes at residences; catalogues that are enclosed in an opaque cover but not addressed to a particular person or address; and catalogues or leaflets that are enclosed in a transparent cover and which may be addressed to a particular person and address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these provisions in this bill is that catalogues and leaflets that are not enclosed in a transparent cover, but are addressed to a particular person or address, will be reserved to carriage by Australia Post; in other words, Australia Post maintains its monopoly over these items. Evidence presented to the committee indicated that this is more restrictive than the current practice. This was disputed by Australia Post and by the minister. However, the practice has been that a number of the direct mail organisations&mdash;and the one that gave the most significant evidence to the committee was the firm Streetfile to which Senator Ferguson earlier referred&mdash;had delivered catalogues and leaflets in opaque envelopes in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this legislation further widens the existing monopoly of Australia Post over these items. We believe that is unsatisfactory. In regard to this particular issue we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage of the legislation to attempt to ensure that existing practices in regard to the issue of catalogues and leaflets continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that arises concerns document exchange services. To our great concern, evidence presented to the committee indicated that the legislation will reduce the capacity of document exchange services to provide their current level of service because they will no longer be able to provide a courier service between their clients' offices and the document exchange service centres. A further concern in relation to this issue is the definition of `organisation ` in the legislation. There is concern that the Victorian government, under the new definition of `organisation', will be prevented from continuing to use a non-Australia Post carrier for its interdepartmental mail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely unsatisfactory that, in a climate where we are supposed to be increasing competition, this legislation actually reduces the area of competition applying to Australia Post. In the committee stage, the opposition will be moving amendments to deal with that problem and to allow a much freer operation of document exchange services and a wider definition of `organisation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue of concern is the bulk interconnection service. Under the legislation, private mail operators will be able to interconnect with the Australia Post system at designated mail centres and to obtain a discount from Australia Post based on the transport costs per letter that Australia Post has not incurred because it has not been required to carry the letter for the whole of its journey. In evidence before the committee, it transpired that these discounts would apply for only interstate bulk mail deliveries on the part of private operators and that intrastate deliveries would be excluded from this provision. That these discounts would apply only if the bulk mail had been transported interstate and not intrastate by private mail operator was even of concern to the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mayne Nickless raised concerns about this issue before the committee and in particular highlighted that the greatest cost benefits that could be gained by private sector businesses that have the need for bulk mail services would be in the intrastate delivery sector rather than the interstate sector. So again the government is not allowing businesses that are dependent on and are substantial users of that mail service to benefit from the maximum possible cost reduction in this area of their business operations. There is significant concern about this that we will seek to remedy through amendments to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other particular area of our concern regards the capacity of the minister to sack members of the board. We believe this is an inappropriate power for the minister to have. Therefore, we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to remove this power from the minister, because we believe it is unsatisfactory that the minister should have that power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I wish to raise is with regard to the service that this legislation will provide to rural people. The Industry Commission report recommended that where roadside delivery is only once a week, it be increased to at least twice a week. It is interesting to note that in its 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS>, the government boasted that every effort is made to provide at least two services per week to rural householders, even in the most remote areas. Certainly this ought to be part of Australia Post's community service obligation, yet in 1992 it was estimated there were 3,152 households not receiving this service. In our amendments to the legislation in the committee stage, we will seek to require that the government provide two services&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994. This morning we resumed the second reading debate on this bill. Senator Ferguson resumed his earlier remarks and Senator Margetts of the Greens (WA) has also contributed to today's debate. We have just heard Senator Chapman's speech, and at this point it is appropriate for me, on behalf of the government, to reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the speeches from the coalition take the theme that the government has not gone far enough in this legislation. However, from the Greens the theme is that the government has gone too far. It is not surprising that we in the government say that we have gone the appropriate distance, and I want to seek to set that out in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 gives effect to the government's response to the report of the Industry Commission following its inquiry into mail courier and parcel services in Australia. An appropriate way for governments to enact legislation is to ask the Industry Commission to inquire and present a report. The government then considers that report and frames legislation accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no obligation on a government to accept all of the recommendations of an independent inquiry. Governments should discriminate and take a view that is wider than the narrow focus of such an inquiry. They should take a wider and more community appropriate view of the recommendations. I think that is what the government has done here. It has balanced the need for efficiency and competition against the need for Australia Post to provide a community service, particularly to those in the community who, either by virtue of the fact that they are resident in rural areas or are at the low income spectrum of the community, want their needs met on a basis equal to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some interest that Senator Chapman, in arguing the theme that we have not gone far enough in accepting all of the recommendations of the Industry Commission, cited the example of New Zealand. If I understand what Senator Chapman was putting, he regards New Zealand as a country that has gone far enough&mdash;certainly, further than Australia&mdash;in this respect. But I have some information about the experience of the New Zealand experiment that might be of interest to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand's reduction in price protection for its postal service&mdash;from 10 times to two times the standard letter rate in one step&mdash;resulted in the closure of 600 post offices over five years in a country of 2 1/2 million people. That was a radical step and one that provoked a reaction in the community that was quite sweeping and dramatic. It resulted in a reduction in New Zealand Post's net income from $31 million in 1988-89 to $5.4 million in 1991-92, and the imposition of an $80 annual fee for rural deliveries. The New Zealand government announced in June last year that the second stage of its postal reforms would not proceed because there were no demonstrable benefits from further change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In managing change, we have to be concerned with the reactions to the actions we take. In the case of New Zealand, it went, as the opposition would describe it, far enough, or further than we did. But the reaction to the closure of 600 post offices over five years&mdash;namely, loss of revenue to the New Zealand postal service and higher charges on rural deliveries&mdash;suggests that we in Australia should learn from that lesson and respond in a more balanced way than the New Zealand government did to the so-called reform of its postal service. That is what this legislation does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to increase competition in the postal sector but has adopted a phased approach to doing so. Its approach is to safeguard the basic letter service so that it continues to cost the same to send a standard letter&mdash;currently 45c&mdash;anywhere in Australia. Its approach is to ensure that the benefits of competition are passed on to the consumers and businesses in the form of price restraint, with standard letter prices subject to a price cap, while at the same time encouraging competition in value added services, such as bulk mail, document exchanges and express mail, and working towards the changes recommended in the Hilmer report on national competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post will remain in government ownership as a statutory corporation operating a national network but it will face competition in new areas. We believe that competition will sharpen its responses and provide greater efficiency in the economy. For example, Australia Post currently competes for about 40 per cent of its revenue while, as a result of the government's decision, it now expects to compete for about 50 per cent or even higher of its revenue because it will be exposed to greater competition in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This competition is expected to provide the impetus for Australia Post to continue to improve the services it provides to businesses and to households&mdash;but, importantly, without jeopardising services to rural areas, and, importantly, without requiring the closure of corporate post offices around Australia. There is no broad community support, in the government's view, for ending Australia Post's reserved letter service at this time. The Industry Commission was unable to identify the costs and, importantly, the benefits from full deregulation of the postal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a phased approach has worked in the telecommunications sector. So it has worked elsewhere. We are not adopting a model that has not been tried elsewhere. This is a model that has been tried and proven elsewhere. The telecommunications sector is a key example. In that sector there have been significant decreases in prices across the board. Both business and residential customers are benefiting from that. New services have been introduced, service quality has improved and the telecommunications market has grown significantly as a result. Consistent with the approach adopted for telecommunications, remaining limits on competition in the postal sector will be reviewed in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduced by the government represents a total package of reform of the sector. Nevertheless, individual aspects of it have come under scrutiny and some pressure has been brought to bear for amendments to address the particular concerns of some interests. I know the Democrats have some amendments, as has the opposition. I will go to those in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for the reason that some aspects of the bill have come under greater scrutiny that the government did not want to amend specific aspects of the package but it has agreed not to oppose some of the amendments put forward in the interests of ensuring the passage of the bill, but only where the effect is consistent with the overall approach that we have adopted. The most significant area in which we have accepted an alternative approach is in relation to catalogues and leaflets. The government will not oppose the proposed Democrat amendment to the bill because it essentially maintains the status quo under the 1989 act and accords with current practice.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was never the intention to deregulate advertising mail; the proposed amendment maintains that position, neither liberalising nor clawing back current legitimate activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendment, catalogues and leaflets continue to be exempt from Australia Post's exclusive right to carry letters under section 29 of the act, irrespective of whether or how they are wrapped or whether a name and/or address is stamped, stuck or printed on any of the catalogues or leaflets or any of the wrappers of the catalogues or leaflets. Australia Post will still have reserved to it the delivery of all letters, including generic or pro forma letters which contain identical text sent to more than one person by use of that person's name or address. A leaflet or catalogue that is carried with a letter of a kind which is not exempt under any paragraph of section 30 will continue to be reserved by Australia Post, as under current legislation. The amendment will not prevent the enclosure or attachment of a single sheet&mdash;for example, a flysheet or address slip&mdash;with a catalogue or leaflet, the sole purpose of which is to direct the item to a particular person or address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendment is unacceptable because it would effectively deregulate the sector, which was never intended by the government. The opposition amendment requiring two household or roadside deliveries per week which claims to be in the interests of rural dwellers would have the effect of widening the gap between those receiving minimal service and those receiving none. It could even adversely affect those currently getting by with only one service per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrat amendment requiring notification by Australia Post of instances where it has become necessary to destroy an item of mail that is physically offensive is also being accepted on the ground that it ensures accountability of the actions of employees rather than impacting on the power to destroy articles where and when warranted. </PARA>

He talked about 600 post offices being closed in New Zealand; to the best of my knowledge, that is almost exactly the same as the number of post offices that have been closed in Australia. I happen to have some personal experience because my own post office was closed a month ago, which is why I am so concerned about roadside deliveries because I am now a recipient of roadside deliveries which, thank goodness, are made five days a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has moved this amendment because it seeks to enhance the community service obligation under section 27 of the principal act. This amendment has the effect of ensuring that all households to which a roadside mail delivery service is available receive such a service at least twice a week. This is in line with the recommendation contained in the Industry Commission's 1992 report on the efficiency of mail, courier and parcel services. In its report, the Industry Commission estimated that such an extension would benefit an estimated 3,152 households which currently receive only one service per week. In its submission to the Industry Commission's inquiry, Australia Post estimated that providing these households with two services a week would cost at least $3.7 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS> the government claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every effort is made to provide at least two services per week to rural householders, even in the most remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess it is reasonable to assume that the cost of such an extension would now be less than that estimated at the time of the Industry Commission inquiry. The Democrats have indicated to us that they will not support this amendment because it does not look into households that currently do not get any mail deliveries. By not looking at the households that do not get any mail deliveries at present, they are not helping any of those households that are currently getting only one mail delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in business in some of these rural and remote areas who received only one mail delivery a week would know how difficult it could be and how this could impact on the success or otherwise of their business. Only recently, we went to centres of Western Australia where not only Australia Post but also telecommunications and other communications are a problem. They cannot even use a fax service because the line will not carry a fax and there is no radio in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think because of the community service obligation, at least to many of these places, it is important that those who are currently getting one service a week should at least get two services a week. If the Democrats are fair dinkum in their attitude towards rural areas, as we have heard that they are at great length from Senator Woodley in his many speeches in this place, I think they would support a situation where those people, as is claimed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS> 1994 and as recommended in the Industry Commission's report, receive at least two services per week. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ferguson said, the problem with the opposition's amendment as we see it is that it does not take into account those customers in rural and remote areas who have no service at the moment. If this came in, those customers would not get any service until Australia Post was able to give them two services. If it came to the point that those ones on the margin who get no service at the moment might be able to get one service a week, they would not get that service until Australia Post was able to give them two services a week. So we think it is more important for people on the margin who have no postal service at the moment to get that one service as soon as possible and, on top of that, that the minister set performance standards. That will later be one of our amendments to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendments come forward in this chamber one at a time, but they represent an overall view of the amending party. Taking the overall view, the opposition is saying that the revenue base of Australia Post will be reduced by greater competition. But this amendment imposes further costs on a reduced revenue base by directing certain things to happen, which removes some discretion from Australia Post to deliver the most efficient postal service for all consumers in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think that we cannot have it both ways. We cannot try to reduce the revenue base and then impose more costs and say that we are concerned about having an efficient postal service in this country. However, with specific recognition of this amendment Minister Lee, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, indicated to me that there are some remarks that I should make. Perhaps I should read from his note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not accept the coalition amendment. It is inequitable in the treatment of households currently receiving less than two deliveries a week in that it proposes no increases for households currently with no roadside delivery services available. It would not necessarily achieve its intended outcome of taking away from Australia Post the discretion of determining service frequency because Australia Post would continue to determine those households that receive one delivery per week, and it may run the risk of preventing Australia Post from introducing one service per week in places where it now offers none but where costs may preclude its offering two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has confirmed that service standards to rural and remote areas be maintained and agreed that a letter service continue to be made available at a uniform rate of postage to all Australians wherever they reside. To safeguard rural postal services, the Minister for Communications and the Arts announced in a joint press statement in February this year a parliamentary review of Australia Post's community service obligations, which is to be completed once in each parliamentary term. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to contribute to the review, which will provide these communities with an opportunity to have a direct say in their postal services. In addition to the mechanisms already available to the minister to change CSOs, the government considers this to be the appropriate policy for ensuring that services in rural and remote areas are adequate, equitable and up to date. For those reasons, we are opposing the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support opposition amendment No. 1. As Senator Ferguson has already indicated, it would require Australia Post to provide at least two roadside services per week in rural and remote areas where currently one is provided. The arguments that we have heard from the Democrats on the one</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>hand and from the minister on the other do not in any way negate the arguments as to why this amendment ought to be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from Senator Vicki Bourne on behalf of the Democrats that this amendment should be rejected in favour of their amendment, which would seek to have performance standards set by the minister apply with regard to mail delivery services. Of course, we do not know what those performance standards might be, and our capacity to control them would certainly be significantly limited, whereas this amendment moved by the opposition writes into the legislation a specific requirement that where there is one roadside delivery service per week, that be increased to two. This was a matter to which I referred towards the end of my remarks during the second reading debate. I indicated that, according to the Industry Commission report, there are 3,152 households in this situation. So it is an increase in the obligation on Australia Post to which Senator Cook referred, but it is a minimal increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard Senator Cook's argument against this amendment. It was&mdash;I hope I am accurately paraphrasing it&mdash;that if we require this service to be provided to those recipients of Australia Post services that currently receive one roadside service per week, it will be a disincentive to Australia Post to provide one service a week where it currently provides none. I do not believe that is an adequate response to this amendment. Clearly, with the relatively few number of households that are in this situation, to have that relatively modest&mdash;I stress `relatively modest'&mdash;increase in the obligation on Australia Post to provide a better service to these people is really no argument for not providing it to those who also receive no service in the current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that the community service obligation on the part of Australia Post is important, particularly in rural and remote areas. I guess that, in discussing this amendment, we could open up the whole issue of the way in which community service obligations ought to be provided. The minister, in his remarks closing the second reading debate, referred to the New Zealand experience, attempting to argue against the points that I made earlier with regard to the Industry Commission's evidence taken from the New Zealand Postal Corporation as regards the adequacy of its minimal postal charge of 70c for private sector competition as against the standard letter rate charged by the Postal Corporation in New Zealand of 45c; and he ascribed to that reduction to 70c in New Zealand the closure of post offices, the introduction of a fee of $80 for certain rural recipients of New Zealand postal services, and so on. As I said earlier, there is a significant margin of 35c provided in the New Zealand situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the community service obligation be maintained. The point is how it should be maintained, I guess. Should it be maintained by all of the users of postal services paying more than would be a competitive rate for the services they use and thereby subsidising Australia Post's capacity to provide its community service obligations perhaps to areas that are non-profitable? In other words, should the cost of those services to rural and remote areas in Australia be borne by the people who use the postal service, thereby increasing their costs of operation, or should it be borne by the community at large? Let us remember that it is described as a `community' service obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if there is a difficulty in this area, it ought to be provided by the community at large rather than by costs being imposed on one section of Australia Post's service users. The best way of achieving that would be for the community service obligation to be met directly by subsidy from general revenue so that the community at large is providing the service which is regarded as an obligation on that community rather than the users of the service. That is simply another point with regard to this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as the minister says, the imposition of this particular amendment would possibly prevent Australia Post from providing one service per week to areas that currently receive no service per week, then the government ought to take up the responsibility of ensuring that that event does not occur and that, indeed, one service per week is provided to those people. It does not negate the opposition's argument that, where there is currently one service per week, two should be applied. As I said in my second reading remarks and as Senator Ferguson mentioned a few moments ago, the government boasts in its 1994 addition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every effort is made to provide at least two services per week to rural householders, even in the most remote areas.</PARA>

Certainly, we are quite adamant&mdash;given the report of the Industry Commission in 1992, which made the recommendation, and, as Senator Chapman said, given that in the government's 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS> it says that every effort should be made to provide at least two services per week to rural householders&mdash;that this amendment should be carried. </PARA>

The explanation that we received from the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) is quite extraordinary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to ensure that people who now get just one roadside service a week should get two. Surely that is part of the process of better assisting the body corporate of Australians. Instead, the minister merely says, `We are going to maintain the standard of service that exists at the moment and improve it in some areas.' But the problem is that in rural and regional Australia, the standard of service in many cases has declined over recent years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get some facts into the frame here. Australia Post provides a letter service to some 7.4 million addresses. All Australians have access to the postal network, although delivery of letters is effected in different ways according to where people live. At an annual cost of $39 million, roadside deliveries are provided by Australia Post to about 355,000 rural and remote households, with a vast majority of them receiving five deliveries per week. So point one is that just about everyone gets a roadside delivery and that, among those who do, nearly all of them get it five times a week. It is not as though we are talking about every single person in rural Australia; we are talking about a fairly narrow group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that this point is not legitimate, but I am saying that, in terms of proportion and in context, it is not as significant as Senator O'Chee held it up to be. He raved on a little about this government not caring about rural Australians and so on. I will not paraphrase his terms; they were a bit of a joke. The point is that that is not the context in which real life is carried on and that is not the priority assigned here for rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me mention one of the other facts. Approximately four per cent of Australian households receive fewer than two deliveries per week&mdash;that is, four per cent overall. Of these, some 3,150 receive one delivery a week and about 125,000 in rural and remote Australia receive no delivery per week to their residence. But they do get deliveries. Where is their mail delivered? It is delivered to a community mailbag or to their post office box in the nearest town, or it is delivered by aerial drop to their neighbour, to whom they drive across to pick it up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept the coalition's amendments. The proposed new section 30(1B) is unnecessary. The meaning of `goods' in section 3O(1B) of the act, which the bill does not propose to amend, is not weight limited only; it therefore normally includes newspapers, magazines, catalogues and books. However, the amendments could have the effect of suggesting that there are limits to the operation of that section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the proposed new section 30(1C), the amendments seek to introduce the concept that catalogues and leaflets do not convey a unique message or information other than the names, addresses or salutations. Effectively, this amounts to a new concept of defining a letter on the basis of the uniqueness of the message, something that has not been adopted anywhere else in the world and which conflicts with the current definition of a letter, which is not being amended. The test of uniqueness is very stringent, is not defined and may have unforeseen consequences.

It is clear, we believe, that not too many National Party members have been consulted by Senator Alston on postal matters. What Senator Alston is proposing in all of his amendments is to substantially reduce the revenue stream available to Australia Post to provide postal services to Australians under its community service obligations. Australia Post estimates that up to $100 million in advertising mail would be put at risk, or $100 million worth of revenue would be put at risk. At the same time, he wants to add an inequitable community service provision that reflects a lack of understanding about how community service obligations are to be delivered. This policy of the opposition, as I say, we suspect has not been considered after any detailed consultation with National Party members, who have a particular interest in preserving postal services in rural areas. </PARA>

We would be funding a direct allocation in the budget for community service obligations if that $100 million in revenue went to the private sector. In the end, quite rightly, the opposition would be talking about the service that Australia Post provides, particularly in rural areas, where everybody accepts that the services are less profitable and may even run at a loss in a number of areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his response to the opposition amendment, Minister Schacht has again raised the issue of the community service obligation. There was some reference to this during the consideration of an earlier opposition amendment. He makes the point that if Australia Post's revenue were reduced by what the government claims would be $100 million if this amendment were passed and therefore it did not retain its monopoly over certain catalogues and leaflets, that loss of $100 million would have to be made up by the government to ensure that the community service obligations were maintained. I suppose one could question whether $100 million would be lost. No doubt, to try to convince the government not to accept this amendment, it probably overstated the amount of revenue it would lose. Notwithstanding that, let us remember that Australia Post, as I understand it, currently makes a profit of about $247 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assume that a substantial amount of that profit goes back to the government. I interjected when the minister said, `This $100 million comes to us.'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister says that it would have to come from the government to fund the community service obligation. I just said there is a profit in Australia Post, currently, of about $247 million. Even if we take the $100 million off, Australia Post will still be making a profit of $147 million after it provides its community service obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, Australia Post is meeting its community service obligation and still making a profit of $247 million. So even if we take $100 million off Australia Post, which I doubt will happen, Australia Post will still be making a profit of $147 million after it provides for all its community service obligations. To say that this amendment will mitigate against Australia Post's community service obligation is clearly nonsense. But let us assume for the moment that it does. As I said in the debate on the earlier amendment, one could have a debate about whether the community service obligation ought to be met by Australia Post generating the revenue to fund that or whether it ought to be met by the government itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that, with Australia Post funding the community service obligation from within its own revenue, in effect Australia Post is imposing a tax on the users of its service to the extent that it requires money from one area of its service to subsidise its community service obligations in other areas. So there is already a tax inherent in Australia Post's operation. Over and above that, of course, it provides further tax because a substantial amount of these profits is paid back to the government as revenue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a dividend but, in effect, it is a tax on the users of Australia Post's services. If Australia Post was purely providing a government business enterprise service, it would be budgeted to break even; if it was really providing a service to the community it would not make a profit and pay a dividend back to the government, it would break even. Then one gets into the debate of whether we ought to have the government maintaining this monopoly or not, but we had that debate earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A component of tax is therefore already built into Australia Post's operation but it is paid only by those people who use Australia Post. As I said in the earlier debate, one can argue about whether that is an appropriate way of meeting that community service obligation or whether the community at large ought to meet that obligation by Australia Post reducing its charges by that amount and by having the community service obligation funded directly by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to that, the minister also said that if one hives off this $100 million to the private sector, then not only would Australia Post not be able to deliver its community service obligation&mdash;a point which I think I effectively rebutted in my remarks of a moment or two ago&mdash;but also the government would have to find the funds to meet that community service obligation. That completely ignores the fact that, if this $100 million is hived off to the private sector, those private sector organisations would make a profit on which they would pay tax which would provide some of that revenue to the government to fund that community service obligation. So there is simply no argument in the community service requirements of Australia Post for this amendment to be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation as it stands is completely arbitrary and illogical because a private sector operator of postal service articles can deliver a brochure, catalogue or leaflet addressed to an individual and a particular residential address if it is in a transparent envelope, but not if the article is in an opaque envelope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material in the envelope could be exactly the same. If it is in a transparent envelope, it can be personally addressed, but if it is an opaque envelope, it cannot be personally addressed. If it is in an opaque envelope, it can be delivered only by Australia Post, not by a private sector postal service provider. There is absolutely no logic in that at all, because the nature of the document that is being delivered has not changed. All that has changed is the wrapper around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved these amendments so that any item can be delivered either by Australia Post or by a private sector postal service provider, provided the item is identical in all respects; in other words, it does not contain a unique message. It is not a letter which has varying content from one recipient to another. The contents of the item being posted are universal to whomever it is delivered. The only difference is that one is addressed to Mr Bloggs and one is addressed to maybe Senator Schacht. That is the only difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no logic in reserving that service to Australia Post. So we have moved amendments Nos 2 and 4 to ensure that a broader range of service providers can deliver these sorts of items, because the items are identical, the only variation is the addressee. The reason that we have done this is that the evidence presented to the Senate committee on this matter was that the legislation as drafted simply was not keeping up with technological change and the efficiencies that can be offered with these sorts of services. The sophistication of computers, which can personally address items, is ignored in the legislation as it stands. On the one hand, we find the government talking about information superhighways and all the other developments of high technology which it wants this country to embrace yet, in this legislation, it is preventing that from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne referred to direct mail letters. Again, in a situation where such a letter is identical for every recipient, other than its being addressed to an individual person&mdash;but the contents, the message and words in the letter are identical&mdash;there is no reason why a private sector mail service provider should not have the ability to deliver letters which are in the nature of advertising material. They are not personal letters, in the real sense, in that the content varies whether it is addressed to Joe Bloggs or Senator Schacht. The wording of the letter is exactly the same, except for the addressee. No restrictions should be placed on who can deliver those letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of these reasons, amendments Nos 2 and 4 that Senator Ferguson has moved on behalf of our shadow minister, Senator Alston, ought to be supported and passed by the Senate, so we get a more rational basis for the items that are reserved to Australia Post. In these amendments, we are not arguing that there are areas that ought not to be reserved for Australia Post. We are arguing about the nature of those items that ought to be reserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, material that is in the nature of circulars, catalogues and advertising material, irrespective of the person to whom it is addressed, which is not unique&mdash;save for the fact that it has an individual name and address on it to ensure that there is an individual recipient&mdash;ought not to be reserved to Australia Post.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make just a couple of further comments on this amendment and on some of the broader issues. It is true that last financial year Australia Post made about $247 million profit, of which $62 million was paid as dividend to the Australian government as the shareholder on behalf of the Australian people. The rest of it was retained earnings to be used for reinvestment and to maintain and expand the service so as to provide the quality of service that the Australian public expect and, quite rightly in my view, demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has said&mdash;there is certain validity to its point in a way&mdash;that the government should forgo the $62 million dividend and that that be used to cover basically the cost of what I said was the $100 million forgone revenue. The opposition has to understand that what we have been trying to do over the last few years in Australia Post under our reforms of GBEs is change the culture away from that of being seen as a Public Service government department. These organisations need to be run on commercial lines. The staff should be able to get some credit, status and congratulations, in a sense, from being able to perform well in a commercial world. Like any other company, these organisations should have ability to pay a dividend to their shareholder. The dividend they pay is a measure of their success in the overall running of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson has been a critic, to some extent, of another government area that I am responsible for&mdash;the Australian Customs Service. The Conroy review last year was all about culture change, and so on. We have had a significant culture change in Australia Post. I have only to go back 20 years to see the horrendous industrial relations problems in Australia Post. There were endless strikes. I am not apportioning blame to management, employees or the unions, but it was an endless dispute affecting the good standing of Australia Post, and the public were sick of it. There was a reduction in services. More and more services were being limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years there has been a revolution in Australia Post in the services that it provides. Australia Post postmasters are now business managers. They are encouraged to go out and find new business and share in the profits, et cetera. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, you have. One of the consequences is that Australia Post should pay a dividend to the government because that is a measure of its success. If Australia Post does not pay the dividend because it is used for community service obligations or whatever, or in the old days in the form of a revenue gift to the government, I really think that is a bad sign for the culture of what we are trying to inculcate into Australia Post and other GBEs in other forms. I accept that members of the opposition have been supportive in many of these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition also has to balance this up a bit to show that there is a way in which Australia Post can provide some of those community service obligations by their own cross-subsidisation. If we are utterly ruthless about cross-subsidisation and eliminate it all, no matter how we pay back in increased community service obligations, I suspect that within the organisation people operating in the community service obligation area often will be seen as second-class employees. They will be seen as not providing the profit within the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone is seeking a promotion or a staff transfer and that person is put into the area of providing services to country areas, a losing area, one has to rely on the parliament appropriating money under the community service obligation every year for the area of that person's activity; whereas the future career prospects of the people who are down in the business district of a major capital city, where there is profit and where they are doing very well, will be measured differently or they would perceive that to be the case. So I think those opposite have to be a bit careful in effecting a holistic approach to Australia Post. </PARA>

Those two major reforms have improved out of sight the provision of Australia Post services to the Australian public. I think everyone would recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both management and employees in Australia Post have to be given great credit for the way that they have gone about accepting the need for a substantial cultural change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an amendment that the opposition regards as most important to maintaining the provision of an existing service that is provided to people who use document exchanges, especially when we consider the volume of documents that are carried by document exchanges. In its submission to us at a public hearing, Ausdoc told us that it has in excess of 15,000 document exchange members, operating in more than 400 exchanges throughout Australia, including many rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that document exchanges be allowed to continue the existing practice&mdash;a practice which has not affected Australia Post to any great extent. As I said earlier, Australia Post still managed to make close to $247 million in profit last year. The work that is done by document exchanges is absolutely invaluable to their users. It is a daily service. It allows lawyers, accountants, insurance companies, and a lot of other business enterprises which require documents to be delivered with much speed, to carry out their work efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence given to us people have said that in the long run Australia Post will not gain any benefit from the government not allowing this amendment to go through. As far as document exchanges are concerned, there are no addressees on the envelopes, there are only document exchange numbers. It would be an added expense for businesses to have to either collect documents from the exchanges or arrange for documents to be collected. By not allowing this amendment to go through the government will be placing an impediment on business, particularly those which require the use of document exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This method of transferring documents has grown over a number of years. Document exchanges are reliable, secure and speedy, providing a same day service.

The provision of an end to end user service is absolutely imperative if this service is to work as well as it should in the interests of the people who want to use it. They want to use this particular type of service because it relates to a specific sector of industry which requires the transfer of documents and the transfer of information on paper to be done in a very speedy way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why the Australian Democrats will not be supporting this amendment.

Such a service may be very attractive to the metropolitan carriage of addressed bulk mail, such as routine accounts and the like. This could result in considerable loss of business for Australia Post; it is estimated that it could be as high as $250 million in business mail.

We are not taking away from Australia Post anything that it currently does. In fact, if this amendment is not passed Australia Post will not pick up any additional business.

Firstly, it will enable a more efficient use of document exchange services by those mainly professional organisations&mdash;lawyers, accountants and so on&mdash;that use this form of communication between their offices.

This also is a very important amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker&mdash;or, to use his correct title, the Hon. Frank Walker, QC&mdash;has announced an inquiry into the system of honours and awards in Australia. He has appointed a committee of what he describes as `eight distinguished Australians' to conduct the review. Mr Walker said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move follows criticism that the present system fails to recognise properly large sections of the community including women, migrants and the less affluent.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Walker says that statistics support such criticisms. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has come to ask all Australians if they are satisfied with the present honours system introduced in 1975 when the Order of Australia, Bravery Decorations and the National Medal were created.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . . . . . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government wants to hear all points of view before deciding if changes are necessary to better reflect the contributions made by all sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Australian community in fact knows very little about its honours system, and that is a pity. Indeed, I believe one of the reasons why women, migrants and the less affluent have not been reflected in the system is the lacklustre effort by a succession of Labor ministers to inform the Australian community about the honours system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women and the Order of Australia</EMPHASIS>, released by Senator Reynolds in 1990, was that women's organisations have a unique responsibility to alert their members and encourage them to increase their nomination rate. I do not know if this report was followed through by Minister Walker or his predecessors. Certainly there was no mention of this report in Mr Walker's press conference. Indeed, the Reynolds report may point to the answer to one of the problems identified by Mr Walker. If nominations are not received, then the Council for the Order of Australia or the Decorations Advisory Committee, however composed, may find it difficult to address concerns about the numbers of women and migrants. It is interesting to note that in 1991 Mr Whitlam rejected any suggestion of quotas in the Order of Australia, saying that a political decision to set up quotas would `insult women'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry can be used as an opportunity to build community awareness and address any problems relating to fairness and access, and examine the actions of the government in properly informing the community about the honours system. Society should bestow recognition on people who have made a special contribution to the community. Let me state what I see as the key principles which underlie any honours system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the system must be seen to be fair and equitable. This avoids controversy regarding entitlements to awards. The transparency of the system by which awards are made helps build confidence in the Australian honours system. In relation to our system, it has to be said, there is very little controversy about awards when they are announced. This is in marked contrast to the United Kingdom, for example, where I understand almost every announcement of a new series of awards seems to lead to widespread public debate. It is important to underline that any individual or organisation may recommend any Australian for an award in the Order of Australia, thus making the process of appointment to the Order of Australia totally democratic and as egalitarian as most members in the community would want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and related point I would like to make is that it is important that there should be a non-partisan approach to an award system. There is little point in every incoming government proposing major changes to the system. In this regard, it was clearly a mistake that Minister Walker made no attempt to consult with the coalition about the review, its terms of reference or its appointees. Indeed, there was no attempt to inform my office about the announcement. Even the courtesy of sending a press release was missing. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry says, `Oh,' but a system of awards and honours is not a partisan project. It is a thing for all Australians and I would have thought that normal courtesies were appropriate. Indeed, it was a journalist who was kind enough to inform me about the announcement and send me the release. This might seem cute politics to Mr Walker but it is really a poor way to start such an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, a system of awards should be non-partisan. Any attempt to use it for divisive political purposes will probably help ensure that any proposed changes are stillborn. There have been attempts to politicise the Order of Australia. In 1984, for example, there was a recommendation that awards should be recommended to the Governor-General by the Prime Minister and state premiers. Fortunately, this was overturned, thanks to the good work of the Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs. As Sir David Smith said in a speech in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . various attempts to compromise the independence of the Order by political intervention have failed . . . that the Order has achieved the degree of public acceptance that it enjoys today, is due to the efforts of our three Chancellors, each of whom has responded to the challenges which the Order has faced during his term of office, each of whom has taken seriously the responsibilities placed upon him by the Constitution of the Order, to be responsible for its administration.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought Mr Walker's comments as relayed on the Channel 9 news were singularly unhelpful in this regard. I must say that the minister's comments at the press conference can only arouse suspicions that there is a political agenda in the review&mdash;the desire to promote Labor's republic. I hope that is not the case and I would welcome his assurances on this matter, and the assurances of the chair of the review committee, that there will be no attempt to use the honours system to advance a political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What on earth did Mr Walker mean when he said that we need `a modern system that Australians own'? Who else owns the Australian honours system? Does he not know that the Australian honours system, the Order of Australia, was introduced by Mr Whitlam? The Labor Party may keep changing its mind about awards, but this I do not think reflects public opinion. Mr Walker must be the only person in the world who thinks the Australian honours system is owned by somebody else. I wonder if he knows that the system is administered by the Australian Honours Secretariat and that the awards are recommended by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the terms of reference Mr Walker states that, except for the Order of Australia, the Australian system largely mirrors the British system. Let us face it, that is a pretty major exception for this review, which is in large part about the Order of Australia. When this is added to the fact that the defence decorations are also purely Australian&mdash;with the notable and honourable exception of the Victoria Cross&mdash;one wonders what Mr Walker is talking about. One of the functions of the committee I believe should be to inform Mr Walker about a few basic facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle underlying an honours system I would have thought was the need for continuity. Continuity helps build respect for the system of awards. I think it is correct to say that the Australian honours system did take some time to achieve full community acceptance. Indeed, I think the standing of an honours system in part reflects its history. This does not mean that we should not have some finetuning. Of course we should. But to revamp radically a system which is barely 20 years old, as in some banana republic, could demean the honours which have already been awarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of observations I would like to make about the inquiry itself. I think there is a concern about the composition of the board. There is one senior public servant on the board, Michael Clarke, the Executive General Manager of Mr Walker's own department, the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sherry" NAMEID="ZW4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is not known to me. Senator Sherry says he is a good man and I am sure he is a most worthy person but the minister puts public servants in a very invidious position by appointing them to such inquiries. Public servants could be placed in positions where they may face a major conflict of interests between the views which may emerge from an inquiry and those held by the minister. I believe it would be best if we have people on the inquiry who do not have this potential problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Walker's press statement announced that the inquiry is to be chaired by Ms Claire Petre, a senior officer in the New South Wales Community Services Commission and a board member of the Administrative Review Council. We had to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that Ms Petre was a member of Mr Walker's staff when he was the New South Wales Attorney-General. I think the fact that this was not included in Mr Walker's press release has come as a bit of a surprise and led to some comment. To put Senator Sherry's mind at rest: this puts a special onus on Ms Petre to ensure that the committee is seen to be independent of the government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`And it will be,' says Senator Sherry, and I hope that is the case. As I mentioned earlier, there have been efforts to politicise the award system and this committee should be particularly careful to ensure that the barriers to politicisation are maintained. Judging from the minister's press release, there does not seem to be anybody on the committee who has a specific expertise in the area of honours. There seems to be no-one on the committee who has a close and detailed knowledge of the present system. I would have thought that at least one person on the inquiry should have such specific expertise. I think it has to be said that there are some concerns about the committee. The appointments that I have raised and the apparent lack of expertise in honours systems mean that the inquiry has not had a particularly good start if it is going to build community confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear whether bravery decorations are included in the review. The press statement mentions bravery decorations but one reading of the terms of reference seems to suggest that they may not be included. I will be seeking further information from the committee on this matter. I think the minister himself has made some extraordinary comments which can only cause concern. Mr Walker describes these awards as not reflecting modern Australia. It is funny that no-one suggests that the Legion of Honour, which was established by Napoleon and survived the restoration of the Bourbons and a further four French republics, does not reflect modern France, a country whose artworks are so much admired by Mr Keating. The Order of Canada was created in 1967. Of course, that was one of the models for our Order of Australia system. I understand no-one is proposing any changes to the Canadian system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not believe that our system happens to be wrong if it has a link to the past. Indeed, the French believe that this link is one of the strengths in their system. We must ask ourselves: are we not undermining the credibility and acceptance of the honours system if it keeps changing? Is not the better answer to promote and improve our existing system? Mr Walker revealed his true colours when he said, `I think the Governor-General has been doing a pretty good job so far in handing them out, but personally I would like to see a president doing it.' In the speech referred to above, Sir David Smith points out the important role the Governor-General has played in maintaining the system free of political interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked by a TV interviewer whether political honours would be included in the review. This does not seem to be the case. It is a little rich for the Hon. Frank Walker, Queen's Counsel, to be critical of the British origins of awards. His two titles are rich in British history. If my memory serves me correctly, he was particularly anxious to obtain both the `Honourable' and the `Queen's Counsel'. The committee should avoid the plague of political correctness which is sweeping the land and the related sin of hypocrisy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter concerning Comcar driver Mr Dennis Reid and a letter which he had published in the Queanbeyan newspaper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South East Magazine</EMPHASIS>, on 20 June 1994. The issue is an important one because it concerns the right of public servants who work in and around Parliament House to make public political comment even though they are in these positions. Mr Dennis Reid is also a local government councillor of some years standing on the Queanbeyan City Council and is a former deputy mayor. The letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South East Magazine</EMPHASIS> under the heading `A hard act to follow!' reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee and Bob Katter both National Party members are a hard act to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Katter National Party MP and O'Chee (boy wonder) have, in my opinion, abused Parliamentary Privileges by their continued attack on retired Senator Graham Richardson over his issuing of a Shoalwater Bay Sand Mining Licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have they a problem with the sand mining operations, that employ workers, or are they both `cupboard greenies' which we know lurk in the depths of the Nationals?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dennis Reid</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queanbeyan.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is strongly worded but that is not something unknown to people in public political debate, as senators in this chamber should know, and the sentiments expressed obviously could elicit a strong response. For the record, it will be apparent to senators that I do not agree with some of the implications of Mr Reid's statements in the letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the point. The issue is whether Mr Reid is entitled to make public political comment critical of parliamentary representatives even though he is employed as a casual Comcar driver and, in that position, is called upon to drive senators and members of the House of Representatives. Clearly, I would submit, the answer is yes, with only two exceptions which demand confidentiality. The first and foremost exception is information gathered from a conversation overheard in the car while transporting parliamentarians&mdash;or anyone else, for that matter. The second concerns matters which are confidential to the department served by the public servant&mdash;in this case Comcar or, in the broader context, the Department of Administrative Services. This latter area has been challenged to some extent by the whistleblower concept. However, that is a development which is irrelevant to the particular case I am raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly clear that neither exception applies in relation to Mr Reid's letter and I am surprised that its publication attracted a complaint&mdash;in this case, from Senator O'Chee. To his credit, Mr Bob Katter did not lodge a complaint, as far as I could ascertain. I am somewhat surprised that Comcar management found it necessary to invite Mr Reid to a meeting where he was met by three high-level Comcar executives. From all accounts Mr Reid&mdash;not unnaturally, I would suggest&mdash;was a little taken aback and queried, `What is going on?' or words to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to my letter to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) requesting confirmation of the right of public servants, including Comcar drivers, to exercise their right as citizens to engage in public political debate, the minister wrote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was explained to Mr Reid very clearly that he certainly has every right to speak publicly or write letters but should understand that this could be perceived as a conflict of interest and in breach of the code of ethics to which public servants are expected to conform. In the case of drivers, this is particularly sensitive as an observer is likely to assume that he or she had the opportunity to have heard the information in the course of their employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted by the confirmation of public servants' rights but more than a little concerned by the implication that the exercise of these rights had best be avoided because someone could perceive such behaviour as a `conflict of interest' and `in breach of the code of ethics' of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lay some stress on the word `perceive', because clearly in this case there was no breach of confidentiality. The matters raised in Mr Reid's letter&mdash;it does not matter whether one agrees or not&mdash;were on public record and clearly not overheard in the car. Yet somehow the suggestion is made that writing such a letter is behaviour that is undesirable and had best be avoided. I believe that the vast majority of members of this parliament would join me in rejecting such an implication. The minister's letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Reid was given the opportunity to discuss the situation with management but in doing so raised some separate concerns which need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the outcome of the review, it is not appropriate to call on Mr Reid for work.</PARA>
<PARA>In the event, Mr Reid lost six weeks work. Not unexpectedly, the review that was carried out during that period confirmed what should have been obvious from the start&mdash;namely, that there was no evidence of a breach of confidentiality. In these circumstances I trust that Comcar management will find a way to compensate Mr Reid for this loss, in accordance with the suggestion made by his union representative that Comcar should do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me add a personal testimonial. I have had nothing but first-class, highly professional service from Mr Reid and, without exception, from all of his colleagues, be they casual or permanent drivers. I value that service very highly and regret the signs, which are becoming frequent, that the government is trying to starve Comcar out of existence. I hope I am wrong in that&mdash;it would be a most regrettable loss. This case is a good example. Even though I believe that Comcar management erred on the side of being overzealous, I believe also that it did so out of a desire to provide the best possible service to us at all times. It is, however, up to us parliamentarians to restore the balance&mdash;eagerly guarding our own rights, we must ensure that we do not trample on the rights of others, including the rights of those who assist us in our work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, let me give a bouquet not only to Comcar drivers but to all parliamentary staff. Having completed his law studies in Germany, my nephew Reinhart Liese is spending the current fortnight in my office looking us over. He has some knowledge of the workings of the German parliament and has offered the view that our staff is more efficient and more courteous than in the Bundestag, in Germany, and our parliament is functioning better than the Bundestag. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to give the fourth speech in a series dealing with the information superhighway and its implications for the future development of the Australian economy and Australian society. This parliament and the government must act decisively on a regulatory regime to focus and shape the new information age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege this time last week of attending a conference at the Australian National University on this subject. Listening to the government regulators and the people from Telecom, one would wonder whether they are aware of some of the vital issues that are facing us with the development of the information superhighway; and this is reflected in government action in this area. What the Labor government has done, particularly under the leadership of Senator Collins and Mr Lee, is just react to events as they happen. The government has a number of measures in place at the moment, but it is all happening too late, because by its very nature this technology is developing so rapidly that it is staying well ahead of the regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ad hoc fashion in which the government is regulating this area is something we have seen before. Last year we had the pay TV debacle, media ownership rules and the problems with Telecom, and now, most recently of all, we have the problems with the ABC. These problems suddenly burst out into the public presence and the Senate scrambles around and sets up inquiries like the pay TV inquiry and the ABC inquiry. I can see that we might need to be in a similar circumstance very soon with the information superhighway if the government does not move into top speed in doing something about the regulatory framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has rather belatedly signalled a development in the area. He has set up the Broadband Services Expert Group, but that group is still deliberating and has not reported yet. He admits that technological change is upon us, and in his arts policy yesterday he more or less admitted that the technological changes are running well ahead of public policy. We have at the moment a whole set of regulations in different industries that are no longer appropriate. We have converging industries, and rules such as cross-media ownership should be revisited because in converging technologies they may no longer be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw in the United States how far ahead of us the Americans are in this area. Not only are they moving rapidly to get the regulatory framework in place, but also a number of states have set up model developments which have the infrastructure well placed to deliver services right across particular states by the end of this century. I refer particularly to North Carolina and Iowa. In the case of North Carolina, all the population will have a nodal point from which people can access information on the information superhighway within 20 miles of them. Al Gore, the Vice-President of the United States, has been a major leader in this, and has called on all states to do this by the year 2000. They are moving&mdash;they are under way&mdash;and we are not seeing that sort of thing happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what the Broadband Services Group recommends. It has brought down a preliminary report and it is starting to discuss some of the major issues; but, unfortunately, while this process has been going on the technologies of computing and broadcasting and telephony are converging. The big companies that are involved&mdash;and I referred to this at some length in my last speech&mdash;are positioning themselves extremely well in the market to take account of this. It is quite possible that by the time we have a regulatory framework in place, it will be just too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. In recent times, the big Packer-Murdoch-Telecom conglomerate suddenly broke up and the new Packer-Murdoch-Optus-Continental conglomerate was created. As well as international interests, two of the huge media magnates of Australia have come into this system. Guess what they have decided to do with their system? They have decided to make it a closed shop. They have said that only their services and the services they designate are going to run on it. Yet, in the United States, at the conference we attended last week and, indeed, in the Broadband Services Expert Group report, we are told that one of the central concepts of this sort of approach is open access. Given that we are only going to have two networks in this country&mdash;basically one dealing through Optus and one dealing through Telecom&mdash;one of them is already locked up. What is going to happen with Telecom? We do not know. We certainly do not know from this government because we do not have any guidelines or public policy principles that will show us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has all been coming for 10 years. It has all been seen for 10 years. We can look to other countries to see what has been happening there. We have a department of communications in this country, and yet there was no real recognition in the 1992 broadcasting act that this was all about to happen. However, two years down the track, it is all upon us. If the government had looked overseas, it would have seen it coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The marketplace, in its own right, is actually starting to respond and starting to get something right, even if the government cannot. It is very interesting that one of the huge computing networks that is now developing is coming out of the university sector, such as originally happened in the United States. The university sector has created AARNet, which is a link of the major university computing systems across Australia. The growth of that is now moving expedientially, as more and more people want to get onto the system. This is really the only viable network in this country. As it was said at the conference last week, AARNet is the only game in town. Not only a whole lot of Public Service providers but also private providers want to get onto this system. However, it is financed by public money; it was supposed to be free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the government in this sort of environment? We really need regulation, direction and leadership in this but the marketplace is scrambling around out there in a regulatory framework that is totally inappropriate with converging technologies. A number of basic principles of regulation need to be laid down. Uncertainty or bias in new regulations could inhibit investment and stall broadband network content. That sort of bias needs to be taken out of the system. Everyone agrees that the principle is universal access to information service for all customers and service providers. Before the government has even really got to the legislation, this has been seemingly trumped already by one of the big conglomerates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where private sectors cannot deliver, there is a real role for the government, for the community service obligation. We have had very little discussion of this. How is the community&mdash;particularly in remote rural areas and in some urban areas where there is very little access to this sort of thing&mdash;going to be guaranteed access? That is a fundamental principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another principle is that we must encourage investment in this sector, and not just through the mega corporations that I mentioned before. Smaller companies should be allowed into the game. When two mega corporations run it, they can, as the Optus consortium has done, start to lock out small investment and private players. If this principle is followed, that should not be happening. It is a tragedy that it is happening, because in this country now we have a lot of people who could potentially build industries on this information superhighway but, because the regulations are too late, they are going to be cut out and industry that could grow is not going to grow at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great need, therefore, to avoid the concentration of power and the development of a duopoly structure. We must try to avoid the haves and have-nots in rural and regional Australia, and I referred to this in detail in an earlier speech. Yet, as one of the senior executives of Telecom said in one revealing comment, `Yes, we are first linking up all the high density areas. We are working in Mosman; there are a lot of units there. We are getting that all linked up.' The most revealing comment he made was, `When we get the money and profit back from that, we are going to plough that into the next stage.' So the aim is to borrow as little as possible on what is pretty much a sure bet in terms of business development and to start ploughing money back in. That is going to be a very slow process. It is going to leave behind the people in the country areas in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not even really started developing the issue of privacy on the information superhighway. There are some very sophisticated electronic tapping devices with which people can delve into companies and what is happening in private conversations and what people are doing on the information superhighway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our President this morning set a precedent by sending a birthday cheerio. I would like to follow that precedent by sending one to our Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, who I note is at the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in rising this afternoon was not to sing birthday greetings but to debate and discuss the area of competition and market policy as outlined by the Hilmer report&mdash;in particular, as it relates to state governments. The federal government has been grossly hypocritical in its approach to this matter. While seeking to coerce and cajole the state governments into adopting an appropriate competitive policy, it is sheltering its mates from the sort of competition and commonsense approach that one would expect from Labor if it were fair dinkum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Tasmanian senator, I am proud of the reforms that my state government has implemented under the excellent leadership of Ray Groom. The Tasmanian Liberal government is well down the reform track. The government has reformed my own profession. There is no longer compulsory membership of the Law Society of Tasmania; that profession has been deregulated. Other examples include the corporatisation of the Forestry Commission, the TT-Line and the Government Printer. My government has sold off the Tasmanian government insurance office and has transferred the government pathology services to the private sector. It has also undertaken considerable pro-competitive reforms to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer report on principles of the national competition policy were initially considered at the last COAG meeting in my home state of Tasmania, in February this year. More recently, on Friday, 19 August 1994, a follow-up COAG meeting was held in Darwin. Micro-economic reform was one of the key items for discussion. It was quite clear that the Commonwealth would reap significant benefits from such reform through increased economic activity in the private sector and, as a result, increased taxation receipts. All that the states sought was a fair share of any such revenue increase to offset any loss of revenue that results from increased competition for state owned enterprises. It was, therefore, vital that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) provide an appropriate formula to share the financial benefits of the Commonwealth national competition policy reforms. Clearly, what the Prime Minister did was present the policy and seek to cajole and blackmail the states into supporting the proposal without giving the states the appropriate rewards for such an initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the federal government itself has not seen fit to move on a number of important areas of micro-economic reform to ensure proper competition. For example, I can refer to the legal services provided by the Attorney-General's Department to the other areas of government. Although the government is paying lip-service to this issue, it is quite clear that it is allowing the Attorney-General's Department to enter into long-term agreements with other Public Service departments for ongoing provision of legal services, even after the cut-off time for the freeing up of legal services to the private sector. It was clear from the outset that the government would play lip-service and continue to provide protection for the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware of the fuss that has been made lately about how the Attorney-General's Department is to be opened up to competition with private law firms and how the Commonwealth and the state governments are determined to expose themselves to the discipline of the Trade Practices Act. They even set up a separate entity called the Legal Practice to compete with the private sector for the business of the various Commonwealth departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date for all this to take effect is 1 July 1995. The cabinet had wanted it to happen this year but a report from an  interdepartmental committee that just happened to have a majority of officers from the Attorney-General's Department on it surprisingly persuaded Cabinet to wait until next year. In the meantime, I have learned that people from the Legal Practice have been going around signing up departments for the exclusive provision of legal services to the various Commonwealth departments and agencies. Of course, if companies were to do this kind of thing, they would most likely be in breach of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked for a copy of these agreements, but was told that to be given them would seriously erode the Legal Practice's competitive position. Then I put a question on notice to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as a follow-up. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the part of the Department known as The Legal Practice sought authorisation from the Trade Practices Commission for it to enter into contracts, arrangements or understandings with the Department of Defence and a number of other Commonwealth departments or agencies, or otherwise sought a ruling for the commission in relation to the matter; if so, when were the relevant authorisations or rulings provided; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA>What was the answer? I will read the relevant bit, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the arrangements between the Legal Practice and the Department of Defence and other Commonwealth departments and agencies in relation to the exclusive provision of legal services I am advised that no authorisation has been sought from the Trade Practices Commission because it is considered that the Trade Practices Act 1974 has no application to those arrangements because they are, in effect, internal administrative arrangements for the provision by the Commonwealth of legal services to other emanations of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should consider carefully the implications of this answer. What the Attorney-General is saying is that competition is okay for everyone else but, when it comes to the Commonwealth government's lawyer public servants, different rules apply. These collusive agreements are just `internal administrative arrangements for the provision by the Commonwealth of legal services to other emanations of the Commonwealth' if we are to believe the Attorney. That is, I suppose, one view of the law. But I invite the Senate to consider what the Trade Practices Act actually says. Section 2A states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in so far as the Crown in right of the Commonwealth carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Act applies as if . . . the Commonwealth, in so far as it carries on a business otherwise than by an authority of the Commonwealth . . . were a corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing in the act about emanations of the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister representing the Attorney-General (Senator Bolkus) who gave this advice, and whether he stands by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More to the point, I remind the government of the competition principles agreement. Clause 3(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of their public sector ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's reply to my question flies directly in the face of this principle. It reveals a situation where the government says one thing about competition&mdash;and what everyone else should do&mdash;but something else about all its so-called commercialised activities. It shows that the government is anything but fair dinkum when it comes to opening Commonwealth services to true competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the area of industrial relations we see exactly the same sort of policy being pursued by Labor. A major area in glaring need of greater competition is our highly regulated and anti-competitive labour markets. Since its re-election in March 1993, the Labor government has reduced competition in the labour market areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles which the Prime Minister so rightly asks the states to embrace and which are contained in the Hilmer report were totally absent when his soulmate Laurie Brereton wrote the Industrial Relations Reform Act last year. That act, along with other initiatives, was an absolutely unprincipled cave-in to the vested interests represented by the ACTU, which is the senior partner in the Labor government. It was simply an election payback for services rendered and moneys provided. The removal of sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act further highlights that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where the federal government has failed with regard to competition is its operation known as Asset Services. At the many national organisational meetings within the building and maintenance industry in Australia, concern has been voiced at the insidious competition by Asset Services against private enterprises. Asset Services competes with the private sector for the installation, maintenance and alteration of buildings, without being required to submit competitive prices. That is, government instrumentalities are accepting prices direct from Asset Services without any further prices being required or obtained from competitors in private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This practice, quite frankly, is unbelievable. Yet it is being allowed to be perpetuated by the Labor government, the same Labor government that seeks to sermonise, lecture and pontificate concerning the way the states ought to operate themselves. No private enterprise in Australia is put in this sweetheart position of giving prices to one of the Commonwealth or State government agencies without having to compete with other contractors. This is an unbelievable, uncompetitive and unacceptable position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the public record from the general manager of Asset Services Australia that Asset Services does not pay payroll tax. Asset Services does not pay fuel excise tax, Asset Services pays no sales tax on vehicles where the client department is exempt and Asset Services pays no financial institutions duty cost to its bankers, the Reserve Bank. In all these areas it has an unfair advantage over its private enterprise competitors. Private enterprise is loath to invest and compete when it does not get asked to price, and if it is asked to price it cannot win. In these circumstances, how can private enterprise accept any responsibility towards increasing employment? In the true Australian tradition, all that is being requested by private enterprise is that Asset Services be made to give other Australian firms a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the Prime Minister's call for the states to get with it and become competitive. Why does he not do it with his own enterprises over which he has control; why does he not do it with the trade union movement over which he has control; or do they control him? Labor calls on the states to cut expenditure but itself expands expenditure. Mr Keating and the Labor government need to learn that what is good for the state goose should also be good for the Commonwealth gander. At the end of the day, national leadership is shown not by the way the Labor government forces, blackmails and cajoles the states into submission, but rather by the actions it takes for and on its own behalf in relation to the areas that it appropriately has jurisdiction over. Labor's actions speak a lot louder than its words. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Early this year the Brisbane retailer McDonnell and East closed its doors for the last time after a century of trading in Queensland. The last of the employees had to endure not only the pain of losing their jobs and livelihoods but also the prospect of receiving only a minor fraction of their superannuation entitlements. While the purpose of superannuation is to provide an adequate income in retirement, this nest egg may also be a financial safety net for retrenched employees who are faced with bills and mortgages to pay but have no income with which to pay them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, 35 former McDonnell and East employees were faced with this very situation but the superannuation safety net for them was missing. The question here is: who is responsible for the $500,000 deficiency in the superannuation fund? This amount represents 65 per cent of the benefits owing to those 35 unfortunate members. How was the fund allowed to get into such a seriously underfunded situation? It seems to me that either no-one was minding the shop, or those who were supposed to be minding the shop were not doing their job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us then take a look at who should have been minding the shop. There are generally at least five parties who play a direct role in managing and investing fund assets, or oversighting those activities. So which of the five parties have failed to do the shop-minding job in the McDonnell and East case? I have been following media reports on this case and honourable senators will not be surprised to learn that not one of the parties involved has stood up and said, `Sorry, it's our fault.' On the contrary, they have either remained silent or have denied responsibility for the funding shortfall. The responses of the trustees and fund manager to media reports are particularly interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1990, all the assets of the North Quay Ltd&mdash;owner of McDonnell and East&mdash;in-house superannuation fund were transferred to division one of the Norsec superannuation benefit plan. The trustee of Norsec at that time was Burns Philp, but was replaced by Permanent Trustee Company Ltd by court order in October 1990. Permanent was the trustee at all times after that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chamber can therefore imagine my surprise when I found that in a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 14 February 1994 the managing director of Permanent Trustee claimed that his company is not trustee of the superannuation fund that held the assets of the McDonnell and East members, but rather the assets were held in the North Quay superannuation fund and the trustees are the officers of North Quay Ltd. That fund had invested assets in the Norsec fund. This may sound very confusing&mdash;it is. As far as I know, the so-called North Quay superannuation fund does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite clear that North Quay was a participant in division 1 of the Norsec superannuation fund. The McDonnell and East employees were members of that fund and, as such, Permanent Trustee Co. Ltd had trustee obligations to those members. The 35 former McDonnell and East employees who have suffered substantial losses can take little comfort from the knowledge that the trustee which was supposed to be exercising all due diligence and vigilance in carrying out its functions and duties in watching the rights and interests of the participants and members appears to deny that it ever had such a responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction of the fund manager to a further media report is even more interesting. The fund manager was Northern Securities Management Ltd until 1993, when its name was changed to Peregrine Investments Management Australia Ltd. An article published in the May 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS> suggests that, contrary to earlier reports, North Quay's financial difficulties were not the main cause of the superannuation fund deficiency, rather the shortfall was largely attributable to the nature of the investment strategy adopted by the trustee and fund manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on information and documents presented at an Industrial Relations Commission hearing, the authors of the article state that, for the period since North Quay joined the Norsec super plan, the fund had suffered approximately $500,000 loss on the market value of investments; a major proportion of the fund's assets were invested in unlisted property trusts; the investment strategy deviated from the investment authority given by North Quay; and that, by exceeding covenanted levels of investments in associated trusts, the fund was in breach of the trust deed and the Corporations Law. This led to the auditor issuing a qualified audit opinion on the funds accounts. It is noted that those property trusts were also managed by Northern Securities/ Peregrine, for which Permanent also acted as trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that Peregrine took exception to the article, if the letter from Peregrine's managing director to the editor, published in the August 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS>, is anything to go by. In that letter Mr Meek claimed that the May 1994 article contained factual inaccuracies regarding the role of the manager and that the opinions of the authors were based on inadequate assessment of the relevant material. I would like to take some time to examine the points raised by Mr Meek to see whether we are able to gain an insight into what the real facts might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is to do with the original investment authority given by North Quay which requested that superannuation fund assets be invested in the market linked option. North Quay management understood this option to include 45 per cent invested in capital guaranteed products and 17 per cent in each of the two Norsec property trusts. When members of North Quay management received the financial reports for the first 12 months in the Norsec fund, they saw that 80 per cent of the fund assets were invested in the Norsec property trusts and they sought an explanation for this deviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, Northern Securities' response was that the large number of payouts to retrenched McDonnell and East employees had caused an imbalance in the asset mix and action was being taken to adjust the asset allocations. However, it turns out that the superannuation fund was then stuck with a high proportion of investments in the property trusts because in July 1991 the government imposed a 12-month freeze on unlisted property trust unit redemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter to the editor, Mr Meek claims that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS> article implied that Northern Securities had misled North Quay in relation to the timing of any alteration to the asset allocation. He claims that this is a fallacious suggestion and makes a number of points about the circumstances surrounding the superannuation funds investment mix, defending the actions of Northern Securities. These comments bear closer examination because I believe that the superannuation fund's financial problems stem from the first 12 months of operation. Explanations of the events occurring within that period probably hold the key to who is responsible for the funding deficiency. I will therefore address the points made by Mr Meek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Meek states that the asset allocation for the investment authority given by North Quay was indicative only, and the original investments were made in accordance with the indicative allocation. An examination of the Norsec super fund's June 1991 financial statements confirms that this was so: about 17 per cent, a total of $750,000, was invested in each of the two Norsec property trusts. However, 12 months later the financial statements show that this percentage had blown out to 80 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, at the time the fund manager's explanation for this was an imbalance in the investment mix caused by a high number of payouts to terminated employees. Mr Meek also refers to the payouts placing `undue strain on the liquidity and investment structure of the fund'. However, a closer examination of the financial statements shows that there is an inconsistency between this explanation and what actually happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounts show that, some time between June 1990 and June 1991, the dollar amount of investments in the property trusts increased by $457,000. So some time in that 12-month period, someone disregarded the indicative investment authority and transferred almost half a million dollars of the superannuation fund's assets from the capital guaranteed investment to the property trusts. Therefore, the reason that the property trust investments jumped from 34 per cent to 80 per cent was not solely high levels of benefit payouts but largely the deliberate action of the trustee and/or fund manager to reduce the proportion of lower risk capital guaranteed investments and increase the proportion of the higher risk property trust investments. A number of critical questions arise here. I do not have time to answer all of those questions. There are many other points I would like to make but time prohibits me from going into those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last of the players in this sorry saga whose role needs to be examined is the employer. I have already referred to the employer a number of times when discussing the role of other players. I make the general comment that the employer clearly should have been more vigilant in monitoring the investment and performance of the superannuation fund. I also make a specific comment that relates to a possible conflict of interest. From the time that the McDonnell and East employees' superannuation moneys were transferred to division 1 of the Norsec superannuation benefit plan in June 1990, to November 1992, there was an individual&mdash;Barry Maranta&mdash;who was a director on the boards of both the employer, North Quay Ltd, and the fund manager, Northern Securities Management Ltd. The question is: did this common directorship play any part in the decision making with regard to the investment strategy adopted by the superannuation fund, changes to that strategy and changes to North Quay's investment authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If public confidence in superannuation as a secure means of saving for retirement is to be maintained, it is important that controls are put in place that help to avoid such situations and, when such cases do arise, ensure that swift remedies are available for members to recoup losses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill 1994 makes two changes to Austudy and Abstudy provisions. It changes the rules so that if students receive Austudy or Abstudy after 1995, they can repay all or part of it so that they can have more room to take out a bigger Austudy or Abstudy loan supplement. The second change means the supplement will be available to students who have missed out on Austudy and Abstudy because of the income of their spouses. If that income is below $35,000 a year, students will be able to borrow up to $7,000 per year to supplement their income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole notion of this bill is for the government to make more money from low income earners. At a time when the `r' has been taken out of free education, the government is now trying to expand the loans scheme to people who might be a little more reliable in paying it back.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, a student has to be an Austudy or Abstudy recipient to get the option of a loan. The student trades in up to $3,500 of the money that is meant to be government assistance for $7,000 worth of debt per year. What a deal! Of course, if a student cannot manage on Austudy, which is way below the poverty line, then any bad financial offer looks attractive, and so the supplement as an option becomes no option for those who are poor enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could change all this by providing parity between the dole and Austudy by adding a rent assistance component of up to $30 per week to Austudy. This would especially aid the students on the east coast of Australia who have to pay the greater part of their Austudy in rent. This lack of rent assistance has resulted in at least 185,000 students experiencing housing related poverty. That estimate emanates from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These 185,000 students, who are below the poverty line, borrowed a staggering $160 million in 1994-95, which DEET estimates that they would not have borrowed had they received rent assistance. This is a clear example of the federal government trying to make $160 million, with interest, from the poorest students who enter higher education in this country. The government consistently looks at the Austudy loans supplement scheme to get more and more people off Austudy and onto the loans, which is just another way of saying `fees.' It is for this reason that the Greens will not be voting for this bill on principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden of costs for students is burgeoning. Not only do students currently have minimum HECS debts over three years of $8,000 each when they graduate from university, but if they take out an Austudy loan over that time they will also have a $30,000 debt before they even start their working life.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not want to stop there, though, and is currently looking at the private funding option in the DEET working paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Resources allocation in higher education</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the amendments proposed by the Democrats and the opposition. The opposition's amendments are much narrower than the Democrats' and are only for families in exceptional circumstances. The Greens, however, would like to see there be Austudy for low income families regardless of assets tests for all farmers.

I refer to the Prime Minister's predilection for the politics of hyperbole, which scaled new heights yesterday when he claimed that no government has ever delivered a national cultural policy on anything like these dimensions. In view of this apparently serious self-assessment, was the Prime Minister disappointed that he did not receive a standing ovation for yesterday's performance?</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no chance of even him losing out on his job if that is the best that can be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is delighted with the reaction, as is the government, to the cultural statement, which is one of the most comprehensive&mdash;if not the most comprehensive&mdash;statements ever made about our national aspirations and ways of realising them. It covers an enormous spectrum of important new, innovative activity, not only so far as the major arts organisations and familiar ones are concerned but so far as the creation of a number of new institutions: the national indigenous people's dance institute and the performing arts centre in Queensland; the proposed new gallery of Aboriginal art here in Canberra; the proposed new academy of music in Melbourne; and the steps that are taken to substantially increase, of course, the funding of the Australia Council so as to enable the benefits of government support to extend to a very wide range of artists right across the spectrum of literary, visual and performing arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, a number of measures are to be taken to increase the accessibility of major arts events and performances to the Australian public at large through many more dollars being available for touring performances by those companies and many more opportunities for access, as a result, by Australians in many parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the statement with which I am particularly pleased is the $7 million that has been allocated for external promotion of Australian culture abroad in the form of $4 million worth of support for touring overseas by major performing companies with associated visual arts exhibitions and, in addition, a provision of $3 million being made for the continuation of the pattern that we have established in recent years of major integrated promotions in particular target countries following on from what we have done successively in Korea, Japan and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a hugely important package, and one of the things that makes it so distinctive and innovative in its character is the fact that it not only does all those things but goes beyond what has been regarded as the traditional reach of cultural or arts statements and has gone into the realm of new technology&mdash;innovative technology, multimedia&mdash;and support for the new kinds of contributions that are going to be made through the film and television industry and through the computer industry and people preparing material for those industries in the new information superhighway and elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am aware that demonstrations were held by some members of the Chinese student community in Melbourne on the weekend. I am also aware of the fact that about 550 people signed a petition objecting to the need for applicants for a class 816 visa to pass an English test. Senator Carr rightly refers to the 1 November 1993 decision. As the Senate would be aware, class 816 is one of four new visa classes which I announced on 1 November 1993. As I made it very clear at that time&mdash;and I reiterate now&mdash;the announcements do not amount to a general amnesty for all Chinese students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also place on record the fact that since 1 November last year more than 40,000 PRC nationals have applied for permanent residence under the classes announced on 1 November 1993. By 7 October, just on 14,000 had been successful under visa class 815. Of these, all but 500 are students who had arrived before the Tiananmen Square massacre on 20 June 1989, and their dependants. This was the group to which Prime Minister Hawke gave an undertaking that they would not be forced to return to China against their will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 November 1993 we also made announcements in respect of students who arrived in Australia after Tiananmen Square. They had not been given any such undertaking. However, they were allowed access to classes 816 and 818 permanent residence permits, which, of course, are available not only to people of Chinese background but to people of all nationalities. Those granted residence in the 816 category, as was announced then and still operates, must have lodged applications for refugee status on or before 1 November 1993. They also had to meet certain eligibility criteria related to age, qualifications and English language ability, and they were also counted against the skills component of the annual migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember in this context that all others who come to Australia as a skills migrant need certain qualifications which have a direct effect on their ability to live and work here successfully. They need to pass a points test. In doing so, they also have to cover age, qualifications and English language ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of English that we require in the 816 visa class is an ability to communicate in a mix of social and work situations. In that context, one of the factors I took into account when deciding on the 816 category was that the vast majority of applicants in this class would already have lived in Australia for a number of years. So it is reasonable to expect they would have acquired some English language skills in that time. I think that is particularly so for those Chinese students who came here with the express purpose of learning English. I made it quite clear on 1 November last year that English language skills would be a criterion in this visa class. No-one criticised it at the time. In the last few months my department has explained the requirement in great detail to interested community members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said on numerous occasions that the government has no intention of changing the requirement for 816 applicants to sit for an English test. About 8,000 people will do so in the first week of November at locations across Australia and I expect that, given the time that these people have spent in Australia, a large proportion will have no trouble in passing the test. Those who fail will have the opportunity to sit the test a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say in respect to the last part of Senator Carr's question that talk of a boycott is irresponsible and reckless. Boycotting will only reduce an applicant's capacity to pass the test and it will only reduce an applicant's chances of staying in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Mr Crean and many other ministers, or several other ministers I think, have said, as I have said, is that Australia's economic fundamentals are such that the long-term interest rates, bond rates, in this country do seem at odds with that particular situation and it is very difficult to understand why the Australian markets in that respect should be, as I said yesterday, so spooked by what are, basically, developments overseas which have no likelihood of having a direct or immediate impact on Australian rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the more immediate interest rate situation is concerned, what Mr Crean and others have been saying is no more than that monetary policy should be set in this respect&mdash;again, according to real fundamentals&mdash;not according to knee-jerk reactions, not based simply on people's expectations or advocacy of a response for response's sake rather than economic necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is the case that it may be necessary for official interest rates to be further adjusted, as appropriate, to reduce the risk of the economy overheating 12 to 18 months out. But if we continue to make such adjustments as are necessary in this respect, such an approach will of course mean that interest rates will not need to rise to anything like the same extent as they have in past cycles. That is a point that has been made over and over again. It is not being suggested for a moment that it is not likely that there will not be some further increase in interest rates as the economy takes off. That was always anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is to make those increases small and timely in such a way that we can ensure that we do not have the environment bursting away as it has in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am aware of the report in the paper. Of course, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report for 1993-94, which was tabled yesterday, amongst other comments did have a section on Customs and about the use of searches of people coming through the barrier, as it is called, at airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the remarks of the ombudsman were constructive and indicate that, in her discussions with Customs, there has been a positive response from Customs in looking at all ways to ensure that the intent of the legislation passed by this parliament is effectively carried out. This means there is a balance between treating people and their normal civil liberties. Senator Cooney has a long history in this place of being a protector of civil liberties of the citizenry. That is recognised, and it is appropriate that he asked this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, this parliament has passed legislation empowering customs officers to carry out various forms of searches at the barrier when people are entering Australia. In 1991, this parliament carried legislation unanimously, I think, to enable officers to carry out what is called a frisk search. It is an informal search of padding of the passengers, carried out by someone of the same sex, who usually looks for things that can be removed from their person without any difficulty. Then there are the other two types of searches: the external search and the internal search. Both these searches require authorisation by either a senior officer of Customs or a judicial officer. There are very strict procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ombudsman has raised the issue that people subjected to these searches were not properly informed at times of their full rights. That is a matter of concern to me, and I will have discussions with the Customs administration to ensure that all those rights are brought to the attention of the individuals concerned. I want to assure Senator Cooney that that is a matter of concern to me. I already note that in the ombudsman's report there has been a positive response from Customs on those issues she has raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable senators, on behalf of constituents, from time to time write to me complaining about the operation of the barrier and of customs officers in the way they carry out their searches and duties. This is a very vexed area. Honourable senators have to recognise that since, for example, the frisk search was adopted more than 30 million people have passed through the barrier in Australia, of whom only nine have complained to the ombudsman. It is a very large number. Further to those nine, I probably deal with several scores of queries a year as the minister for Customs. There is a very thorough review of every one of those complaints from the public, particularly from members of parliament on behalf of their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it should be recognised that people arriving at the airport have often been on a plane for 30-odd hours or more and are probably lacking sleep or are a bit short-tempered. Of course, they want to get through customs as quickly as possible and that often leads to some angst accordingly. But we have to carry out the laws as prescribed by the parliament to protect the barrier, and we will continue to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. At the meeting of the Basel Convention in March, did Australia assent to a consensus decision to cease totally the export of hazardous materials to non-OECD countries for recycling by December 31, 1997, in short, to close the recycling loophole? Is Australia now attempting to negotiate the continued export of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries such as India after 1997?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the second conference of parties to the Basel Convention in March, Australia did, indeed, join a consensus to phase out by the end of 1997 the export of hazardous waste from OECD to non-OECD countries for recycling or recovery. At the conference, we did seek to retain more flexibility with regard to a ban than other countries were willing to accept. In seeking a more limited ban, which would have specifically allowed a window for properly regulated trade and hazardous recoverables between OECD and non-OECD countries, Australia was not trying in any way to defend environmentally unsound practices or to preserve opportunities to dump its wastes on others. A major concern rather was that the OECD/non-OECD distinction is not manifestly ideally suited to this part of the world where very few countries are members of the OECD.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also concerned that, in the absence of effective arrangements for managing hazardous waste, the decision would do little to protect vulnerable countries from trade between non-OECD countries. At the present time, we are of the view that no firm decision should be taken concerning the implementation of that decision until there have been consultations with our non-OECD regional trading partners. To that end, bilateral discussions with our trading partners commenced this week. A delegation is currently visiting India, China, Japan and South Korea with our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To answer Senator Coulter's second question, Australia is not attempting to negotiate the continued export of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries, such as India, after 1997. The purpose of the visits that are currently being made by the Australian delegation to the region is simply to collect information on the management of current bilateral trade in hazardous waste and, in particular, the conditions for recycling. This effort is being made to ensure that our obligations under the Basel Convention are, in fact, being met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the third question, I can assure Senator Coulter that no toxic metalliferous waste will be exported for final disposal from Australia to non-OECD countries after 1997. It remains premature at this stage to make a final statement on the matter of such exports for recycling. The recycling ban will not come into effect until the end of 1997, nor is the decision on such recycling legally binding. We need some time&mdash;and we will take some time&mdash;to reach a position on this matter. We will do so only after extensive consultation with community and industry groups, with regional trading partners and with other parties to the Basel Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will add a further comment on this subject. I was frankly appalled at the treatment of this item on an Australian television news service which was beamed throughout the entire region last night. I happened to see the 6.30 a.m. version of it this morning. The second headline item, after a reference to the China-US defence agreement being signed, was in these terms: `Australia accused of dumping toxic waste in Asia.' When we got to the item itself, around four-fifths of it was a complete, thorough-going bucket job on us, based on the Greenpeace assault, for allegedly seeking to undermine a UN convention. Only a couple of sentences of the report were devoted to the reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that no-one can object to Australian television being fiercely independent of the government, nor does anyone suggest that individual items of this kind have to pass some loyalty test before they go to air. But it is quite another thing to engage in gratuitous Australia-bashing of the kind that was contained in that item. They have to expect to be responded to in this particular way when they do that, if they want to continue to expect any support from anyone here in Canberra.</PARA>

In respect of that, we are also seeking&mdash;as I said in my answer&mdash;consultations with regional countries about their attitude to the proper treatment of this issue after 1997, bearing in mind that the OECD/ non-OECD distinction has very little application in this region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be said that the nuclear framework agreement that was concluded yesterday our time, 17 October, between the United States and North Korea is a major breakthrough. It will make an important contribution to reducing tensions and halting the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation in north-east Asia. It will build trust and contribute to a more benign security environment on the Korean peninsula. This could open the way for progress, furthermore, in the dialogue between North and South Korea. Australia, along with the rest of the international community, has preferred to see a negotiated settlement of the problem. We very warmly welcome this outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the framework agreement, which is to be formally signed in Geneva on Friday, is the commitment by North Korea to permanently freeze the operation of its existing graphite moderated research reactor, to seal its plutonium reprocessing facility, to retain in storage and eventually ship out of North Korea the spent fuel recently unloaded from the research reactor, and to halt the construction of two new large graphite reactors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Korea, very importantly, has also agreed to the full implementation of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and in accordance with its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This includes a commitment to cooperate with the IAEA in resolving doubts about the quantities of plutonium it has produced in the past outside safeguards. The DPRK, in return, will receive assistance from an international consortium to construct two new light water type nuclear-powered reactors to meet its energy needs. Light water reactors are less sensitive from a proliferation point of view because they are much less readily configured for the production of high grade plutonium. They would be operated, furthermore, under full IAEA safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point to emphasise&mdash;and it has been by the United States&mdash;is that no significant nuclear components for the reactor project will be delivered until the DPRK has fully complied with its IAEA safeguards obligations, including the requirement to verify its past activities. Full IAEA safeguards will provide the essential non-proliferation assurance that Australia, the United States and the rest of the international community have demanded in relation to the past, the present and the future nuclear activities of the DPRK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clarification of some of the DPRK's past activities may take some time but the important point is that full verification will be achieved. The fundamental authority and integrity of the IAEA safeguards system will be protected. The US will also provide North Korea, as part of the package of measures under the agreement, with security assurances covering the threat or use of nuclear weapons. Trade restrictions will also be eased and the two sides will move towards the full normalisation of political and economic relations. It is also very pleasing that the DPRK has agreed to resume dialogue with South Korea. So the agreement does provide the foundation for a nuclear weapons-free Korean peninsula. It will make an important contribution to global and regional security and it offers the basis of a resolution to an issue of the highest security importance for us in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, South Korea and Japan are expected to play a central role in financing the light water reactor project. Australia has no nuclear power industry and we are not in a position to become directly involved in this element of the package. There may, however, be other opportunities for Australian participation in the provision of an interim energy alternatives. We will be examining these possibilities as the consortium details are worked out and as needs and priorities are defined. Any Australian involvement would depend, of course, on the DPRK's full implementation of its safeguards obligations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I note today that the Prime Minister is to meet the banks to discuss the issue of farm debt. Whilst this is a useful first step, will the Prime Minister recognise that what is needed now, because of the seriousness of the debt crisis, is a proper national debt summit at which the banks, farm organisations, small business bodies and state and federal governments can discuss creative long-term solutions to the debt crisis? Will the government give consideration to providing tax incentives to banks that want to provide partial debt write-offs to keep struggling businesses in rural areas afloat, because the cost of not doing so would undoubtedly later be much higher because of the write-downs through losses that would be incurred on other businesses and the cost to the public revenue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will make sure the Prime Minister is made aware of Senator O'Chee's suggestions in this respect. The government is deeply conscious of the rural community's problems as a result of drought, and the financial implications of that. Of course, small businesses, like farmers themselves, have substantially benefited from the Commonwealth's funding assistance to farmers as a consequence of the significant flow-on effects of the drought relief package in rural regional economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Senate is well aware of the scale of that particular assistance package which has been costed at some $164 million over two years, with that amount expecting to be exceeded if additional circumstances declarations are made or if the drought persists well into next year. I do not think I need to track over the details of that package; they are familiar to the honourable senator. As I said, I will pass on his suggestion to the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The services exports part of Creative Nation is a very small part but from a trade point of view it is important. Creative Nation also is just one of a series of positive initiatives in services exports that the government has taken. The previous one to which I wish to refer is the launch in early September of the LEK Partnership Pty Ltd intelligent exports studywhich showed the substantial performance of services exports in the Australian economy.

In services overall, there has been a very substantial improvement in our trade performance&mdash;particularly, for example, in education, which went from virtually zero in 1986 to $1.5 billion in 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to Senator Alston's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The copyright issues which Senator Alston has identified have not been omitted from the Cultural Statement through oversight. Each issue is being dealt with thoroughly through a process of examination and consultation. The outcomes of these processes should not be pre-empted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is untrue to say that the Government has no idea what copyright protection is appropriate for the new communications environment. The Government's record shows that it has moved quickly to maintain comprehensive protection of copyright owners' rights in the face of rapid advances in technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1994, the Minister for Justice established the Copyright Convergence Group (CCG) to examine and report on any amendments to the Copyright Act that may be necessary as a result of the convergence of forms of delivery of copyright materials to consumers&mdash;analogue and digital transmission over the air, via satellite and microwave and via cable. The group also considered the protection of multi-media works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CCG has now completed its task, and presented its report to the Minister for Justice, who released it on 26 August. The Minister for Justice is formulating a proposal for a Government response to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural materials under the Copyright Act, the Government recognises that the law as it now stands is not adequate to address all circumstances. The Government is committed to reform in this area as part of the continuing process of reconciliation, and its broader social justice package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next week the Ministers for Justice, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and Communications and the Arts will release an Issues Paper outlining current copyright protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and cultural expression, and options for more appropriate legislative schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is seeking contributions, particularly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, about the limitations of the law and on options to address the issues discussed in the paper. Submissions will be due next January.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation have been undertaking an extensive consultation process with indigenous communities and organisations on social justice issues. Widespread comment has been received on intellectual property issues during this process. ATSIC and the Council are expected to report, separately, to the Government on a wide range of social justice proposals. These two reports are due in early 1995, and are expected to include recommendations on intellectual property issues including indigenous cultures and knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, it is totally false to accuse the Government of refusing to give details of its commitment to the protection of the moral rights of all copyright creators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A discussion paper entitled `Proposed Moral Rights Legislation for Copyright Creators' was released by the Ministers for Communications and the Arts and Justice in June this year. That paper set out options for amending the Copyright Act to provide for the moral rights of attribution and integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney General's department received around 80 contributions on the discussion paper by the final date for submissions and comments in September. These are being examined, and the Minister for Justice will move shortly to introduce draft legislation to secure these rights.</PARA>

The government considers that the taxation of native title compensation payments should reflect the approach to capital gains tax on compensation payments generally. This approach is outlined in a draft taxation ruling issued by the Australian Taxation Office on 4 August 1994. The government also recognises that there are issues peculiar to native title which need to be addressed.

<PARA>I wish to comment briefly on the hyperbole expressed by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in recent days in relation to the cultural document released yesterday because I think it is very important that Australians should understand.

I do not think I ever had any doubt about our history. We all learnt it at school. We all understand it. We all relish it. We all travel overseas, we come back to Australia and we are proud of the place. But he is not. He says, `The tide of our national consciousness has turned. Nothing has done more to free us from our insecurities.' Whose insecurities? He might have them. We do not. We do not suffer from cultural cringe. He might.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that the real problem in the cultural statement, and certainly the problem that emerged from the non-answers to questions on it today, was the fact that there will be greater centralised control over the arts in Australia as a result of the changes being made in the Australia Council. This poses a simple and, for me, pretty direct problem because it is much easier when control is centralised in one body to effect control over it. I do not want to overstress the evident links that already exist between the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Australia Council, particularly of course when the chairperson of the Australia Council becomes a full-time chief executive. These links are both personal and practical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be a genuine matter of concern that making the Australia Council much more `evidently powerful' and therefore much more directly capable of being the creature of the Prime Minister creates a serious problem for the arts in Australia, a serious problem for their independence and a particularly serious problem relating to the extent to which this Prime Minister has already shown a predilection to use the arts for achieving his political objectives as part of his political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, I must say I express serious concern at the apparent direction that the funding of the arts will take&mdash;I trust the arts themselves will be capable of resisting this&mdash;under this centralised body directly under the influence, the aegis, the control, the direction of the Prime Minister. That is why I asked in a question today, which was not answered, whether the words `arms length' used in relation to the arts in terms of there being funding at arms length really means just the length of Mr Keating's arm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that many of the criticisms in the cultural statement take up a lot of the points that I raised over the three years or so that I was shadow minister and which were continually dismissed by the government. That is why I was very grateful to hear Senator McMullan give me some commendation. Obviously now the points that I was making have been recognised belatedly by this government.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australia Council&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>It believes it has to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">undergo a process of structural change to meet the new requirements of its role.</PARA>
<PARA>It believes&mdash;I will repeat this because it is a vital point and I got strongly criticised for my comments about peer assessment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a peer assessment system which is not efficient of time and resources for both Council staff and its clients should be changed. [The Government] further believes that the process of applying for, and being assessed for, funding should be simple and transparent so that those clients who are unsuccessful in their applications can clearly understand the reasoning behind the decision. The Australia Council should also squarely address the question of whether any change is needed to its current means of defining `peer'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the points I continually made. The government also believes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changing the peer assessment process will not of itself, however, be enough to equip the Council to carry out the role the Government requires of it. The Australia Council structure, which has evolved over 20 years, should be simplified in order to enable the organisation to respond more flexibly to the changing needs of the arts community.</PARA>

But if we are to give the experience to all Australians, then all the various forms of our cultural achievements ought to be funded.

<PARA>When I look at some of Senator Cook's answers to what are notionally very simple questions, I never cease to be amazed at how he tends to be able to weave into his remarks a web of what I would consider to be unimportant matters. But the point I really want to make is that if Senator Cook had stopped at the end of his first sentence, when he said that this government has no intention of using the proceeds of lotteries or gambling to fund social welfare, I might have believed him. I am not quite sure though, because the track record of Labor governments in Australia with regard to the introduction of gaming and lotteries to fund social welfare is not all that good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only speak for my own state, and I am sure that Senator Coulter will back me up. We know that back in the 1960s, after a long period of Liberal Party government in South Australia, we had a Labor government that introduced the first forms of gambling into that state in order to bolster government revenue. It said it would use this revenue to provide money for hospitals but, in reality, the money went into general revenue and hospitals did not receive any more money than they had under previous governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Labor governments, not conservative governments as Senator Cook might try to suggest, that have used the revenue from lotteries and gaming to try to bolster support for social welfare or welfare payments&mdash;or, in the case of South Australia, for hospitals. It so happens that the building that houses the Lotteries Commission in South Australia is called the Frank Walsh building, Frank Walsh having been the first Labor premier in South Australia for a considerable time&mdash;I think some 26 years after the Playford government. So we have a Labor government thinking that the revenue from lotteries and gaming is so important that it will name a building after the first premier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in the late 1960s that a Labor government sought to introduce lotteries, gaming and gambling in order to fund certain of its payments which previously came out of general revenue. Then, in the early 1980s, when the Labor government saw that gambling and lotteries revenue was really a form of voluntary taxation, one that seemed to be pretty painless for the people involved, it introduced a casino, various forms of scratch money tickets, betting on the football with the TAB&mdash;as a matter of fact, there is hardly anything these days in South Australia that people cannot bet on if they really want to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the introduction of each form of lottery and gaming, the sole purpose was to provide revenue for the government. In this case, it is revenue that the government says it will put straight towards the funding of hospitals and other institutions which it otherwise should fund from taxation and general revenue. But the government prefers to use this form of voluntary taxation through gambling to fund all of these enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that Senator Cook should try to link, as though it is a conservative disease, some move by a Conservative government 12,000 miles away to use gambling or lotteries to fund some of its social welfare payments. To the best of my knowledge of Australian history&mdash;Senator Cook, having been a long-time member of the Labor Party, ought to know this&mdash;Labor governments, certainly in South Australia and, I am quite sure, in every other state, have used the revenue from gambling and lotteries to bolster insufficient support for hospitals and other welfare institutions within their own state boundaries. </PARA>

Unfortunately, as is Senator Cook's wont, he decided he would not stop then. He likes the sound of his voice so much that he went on to try to make us believe that this is something that conservative governments do and that Labor governments will have nothing to do with, when in fact history shows that Labor governments have been responsible&mdash;particularly in my state but probably in most states&mdash;for the introduction of gambling to provide revenue for social welfare purposes. </PARA>

What saddens me is that, in his going back over activities since his report, there is a surprising number of recommendations which have not been implemented. Thirteen of the 17 recommendations which were accorded the highest priority for implementation in audit report No. 38 have not yet been fully implemented. Of the 43 recommendations made in the report, implementation had been completed in regard to 13; no action had been initiated to address five; and some action was under way on 11, but only proposed on 14. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that Defence has problems like every other department in terms of funding, and Defence has perhaps suffered more than most in having a large number of jobs to do and inadequate funds with which to do them. However, one of the things the Auditor-General has pointed out is that existing funding mechanisms may not be adequate to ensure the timely repair, maintenance and environmental sustainability of training areas. That is something we should all be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If repair and maintenance of training areas&mdash;or any other part of our defence facilities&mdash;are skimped, eventually we will pay a big price. In addition, if we skimp on protecting the environmental sustainability of our training areas, the nation will also pay the price for that. So the government must look at the Auditor-General's comments and see why it is unable, as a government, to provide sufficient funding to ensure the timely repair, maintenance and environmental sustainability of training areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found it interesting that the Auditor-General said that, following his report two years ago, army conducted its own study of the management of training areas, confirmed the ANAO findings that it had examined and also recommended action to be taken to implement the audit recommendations. Nevertheless, many of the tasks which arose out of it were still at a preliminary stage at the time of the follow-up audit&mdash;two years after the original audit report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the surprises I found in reading the Auditor-General's report is a matter which relates to the Department of Finance. The Auditor-General pointed out that, in the period since the report was tabled in June 1992, Finance&mdash;as a result of its assessment of Defence's responses to the original recommendations or of advice received in the quarterly reports prepared by Defence&mdash;decided that no further reporting was necessary by Defence on 29 of the 40 recommendations which Defence had agreed to or had agreed to in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What saddens me is that Finance has not been prepared to keep a close enough watch on this matter. The ANAO, using its powers to access Defence records, has formed the opinion that Defence has not yet fully implemented 18 of those 29 recommendations. So Finance was not looking closely enough at what was actually happening. It took Defence at its word. I suggest that in future it will have to look a good deal more closely to see whether the action matches the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General was pleased, as I am, to see that Defence is now adopting a tri-service approach to addressing some of the issues, but referred to a number of other matters which should be put on the record. There is the need for completing the development of management information systems. That has been dragging the chain. Once again, I guess the lack of funding for the necessary equipment is probably behind the delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence has had a long jump to try to improve its information technology over the last few years. I recognise that it cannot do everything at once, but these management information systems are important and they will make the job of managing our training areas much better once they are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which the Auditor-General raised was the need for the development of policy or procedural guidance regarding training area acquisitions. That is not entirely agreed by army, for example, and I think it is wrong. Although army argues that its acquisitions take place only spasmodically, people come and go in Defence and in the defence forces and they do need guidelines, even if they are basic check lists for people to learn from the lessons of the past, to avoid the mistakes of the past. There have been some pretty awful mistakes in the past in the process of acquiring training areas, so I do not think that succeeding generations should be put in the position of making the same mistakes again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria needed by army to usefully analyse training area utilisation and cost data are yet to be completed. That is a recommendation which it is in army's own interests to develop. The recommendation was that army review the cost and utilisation of the training estate on a regular basis, and that a set of criteria needs to be developed to provide army with a management tool to highlight low utilisation of a training area; to compare the operating costs of all training areas; to enable army to assess the costs and benefits of a training area; and to enable army to review options available in regard to the use of training areas. Back in 1992 army agreed to that. However, that has not really been put into place effectively yet. The Auditor-General considers that the army should hurry on with that, and I believe that is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of importance to the nation is the security of these training areas. Questions of trespass and unexploded ordnance are in the interests of all of us. We do not want people who do not speak English or children straying into areas where they could be harmed. I was surprised to find that there are not adequate security notices which can be easily understood by all Australians. Although there has been movement since the original report, it is still dragging the chain and it is something that we should be monitoring to see that it is improved. The Auditor-General says that he considers that a need still exists for policy guidance on security and that the department should implement recommendation 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a most serious accident at Holsworthy which resulted in a board of inquiry. The Auditor-General in recommendation 19 had recommended that the lessons learned from that incident should be communicated to other training areas. Two years later the Auditor-General has come back and tried, through his investigation of manuals and materials within the department, to see what has been done, but could not find evidence that the lessons learned had been transmitted to other parts of the Defence Force, and recommended that it should occur at the corporate management level within the army. The distribution of the lessons learned is the second part of that recommendation. I could not agree more, and I find it surprising that that action was not taken speedily. In this case it was not a question of cost; it was a question of commitment. I am surprised that it has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General raised again the need for close liaison between the environmental management sections within the department and the army. If there is not such close liaison there may be duplication in the roles and activities fulfilled by each area, which increases the potential for duplication of policy development effort. There are limited enough resources to go around, few enough Defence dollars. We do not need waste and duplication. When it is not necessarily a single service issue, when it can be done on a tri-service basis and when we can avoid duplication, we should be striving to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with some wry amusement that at the time of this new audit the two sections were seeking to reach formal agreement regarding their respective environmental management responsibilities and were intending to establish a committee to meet regularly with a view to avoiding duplication of effort. Honourable senators would know that I have spent a good deal of time in this place over the years talking about the monstrous regiment of committees in the Department of Defence. When I last had responsibility for a portfolio in this area there were 90 committees. I have been trying to find out how many of them have gone whilst I have been engaged with other portfolios. Although a few have been whittled away, I believe it is not very many. But that will be something for another day; we will follow that up then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is necessary for the department to pursue the finalisation and release of a departmental environmental policy and guidelines to be consolidated into a single manual of environmental policy and procedures. Each service needs to develop its own strategies, and that is not disputed, but the services are still proceeding with the development of individual strategies and there still appears to be a duplication of policy development effort. As I have already said, duplication should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I would like to refer to the second part of the Auditor-General's report, which is entitled `Preliminary Study: Acquisition of Additional F111 Aircraft'. There was a need seen to extend the original life-of-type target for the F111 fleet. In order to achieve this, the government bought aircraft, F111Gs, from the United States at a reduced price. I want to make a couple of comments about that acquisition, which is referred to in the Auditor-General's report, although a detailed study was not conducted here as was done with the training areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things that I found in this section was the recognition by the Auditor-General of something which the opposition has been saying for several years now, that is, the problems which we will be facing and which we have already started to face in the bulge in the capital equipment program. It has not been carefully staged so as to allow proper personnel and training funding to go hand in hand with the capital equipment program, and we will pay a heavy price for that imbalance and for that distortion of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the F111G acquisition was to allow the consideration of any replacement for the F111s to be delayed by five to 10 years. The Auditor-General noted that this could be pretty important for Defence as the current projections for major capital equipment investment showed that a significant congestion in the requirement for capital funds is due to occur around 2010, the original life-of-type target for the F111 fleet. This projected expenditure includes the acquisition of replacements for existing tactical fighter aircraft, strike-reconnaissance aircraft, destroyers and armour. That is something which not only this government but succeeding governments will have to juggle with unless more funds can be found. It is of serious moment to us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude on the subject of the F111G, I would like to say that there will be some logistic support difficulties with the introduction of this aircraft. There will be no increase in flying hours, but there will still be additional operating costs associated with this model due to the need to manage additional unique spares and equipment for this G model, and also the need to conduct some initial maintenance in accordance with the USAF calendar-based maintenance philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that these additional costs have been estimated at $3 million per annum. As we are now in a situation with the defence budget whereby every dollar that we can put towards training and personnel costs is a dollar worth while, it is sad to see our being up for another bill of $3 million a year because of logistic support difficulties with a different model. It is the price we are paying to extend the life of the F111C. There is also a problem with personnel in relation to the purchase of these aircraft. There have been potential difficulties in providing adequate F111 trained service personnel. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO was advised that a temporary increase in manpower had been approved . . . and that Air Force will manage the personnel required to sustain operations in the context of its total constrained establishment and the Chief of the Defence Force's (CDF) Preparedness Directive.</PARA>
<PARA>That flags, for me, ongoing problems in the future in terms of the provision of personnel. The money for those personnel will have to come out of an already limited personnel budget. Just as the navy is already struggling to find the personnel to man the ships, it looks as though the air force, down the track, is going to be in a similar position in order to man the F111s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is urgent that the government give proper consideration to the problems which it has caused through the imbalance in its defence budget through the shopping list of capital equipment that it undertook all at one time, instead of staging it in the way in which a good, frugal housewife must do. One cannot buy it all on this week's pay. Some of it has to come out of next week's, next month's, next year's. But Mr Beazley, when he was minister, went on a shopping spree par excellence. The trouble is our obsolescence will all come in a heap as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime we must face this very serious problem of affording the manpower, training them and using them to defend Australia. It is all very well to have the ships and the planes but if they sit on the ground in their hangars or they are tied up at the dock, they are not going to be ready to defend Australia as and when needed. That is a serious matter. It is only obliquely or minutely referred to in this report. But the Senate should be aware that that is a problem facing the defence of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Japan and the Republic of Korea in July of this year is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A time of change, a time of opportunity.</EMPHASIS> Bilateral delegations are, as the report suggests, vehicles for promoting understanding and good will between parliaments and nations. On that basis this delegation was an unqualified success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bilateral visit was very enjoyable. It was very well hosted and it was a very pleasant delegation to be a part of. It comprised the Hon. Stephen Martin, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the leader and myself as the deputy leader. Senator West led another part of the delegation later in the trip. Other members of the delegation were Mr Ferguson, Mr Hawker, Mr Horne and Mr McGauran. It was an unqualified success as far as I was concerned because we all got along very happily with each other. I think we learnt a lot, which is what we were meant to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record our thanks and appreciation for the hospitality of our hosts and the help and assistance given by our hosts, officials and others whom we met on our trip. I thank the ambassador in Japan, Ashton Calvert, and Mr Mack Williams in the Republic of Korea, and their wives, who were absolutely wonderful to us on this study tour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others who need special thanks are Don Dobinson, Elizabeth Toohey, Adrian Morrison and their spouses. It was a happy trip, as I said. I think we also should pay a great tribute to Ian Dundas because, as the secretary of the delegation and as the person who had to get us on and off planes and on and off buses, I think he did an exceptional job. He was also a very good photographer. Some of the photos that we have come home with provide great memories for us all. Also, Claire Cooney, from the Speaker's staff, was outstanding in helping us in a lot of our endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landing in Tokyo was quite an experience. Tokyo has a population in excess of the total population of Australia in a very small area. It is one of the largest cities in the world and it is quite awe inspiring. It is also very awe inspiring that, in a city of that size, we felt safe. We could walk through it at night or during the day and always feel safe. It is also a clean city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official objectives of the delegation were to assess and evaluate the political and economic changes occurring in both countries and to further develop bilateral ties. The delegation also took the opportunity to discuss matters relating to primary resources, the most obvious being coal and beef, having regard to the export values of those two commodities. I had a special interest in the area of beef. I declare my pecuniary interest at this stage. Of course, coal is a very important export for Australia. It is also very important to my state of New South Wales. Indeed, Japan is Australia's main trading partner and South Korea is our fifth largest, even ahead of Taiwan and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited Japan at a time of political unrest and change. It was a privilege that we were able to be there at such a dynamic time in Japan's political history. We were honoured to have discussions with the just elected Prime Minister, Mr Murayama. He reiterated the opportunities for Japan and Australia to strengthen their relationships, particularly in matters affecting the Pacific Basin. In fact, as I understand it, we were the first foreigners to get in to see the new Prime Minister. I think we actually got there ahead of others who were waiting in the ante-room at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to receive assurances from both Prime Minister Murayama and Foreign Minister Kono that Japan would continue its commitment to implementing the outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT. When we went there many people were saying that they did not think the government would stand because it is a very interesting and different type of coalition, with a socialist Prime Minister and a conservative part of the government behind the scenes. Basically, I think it will stand the test of time. Of course, much will depend on the state of the Japanese economy and its success in reforming economic regulation. It appears that the recession has bottomed out. The Japanese economy, even though it remains flat, is bumping along the bottom and I believe it is about to start moving upwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession and the appreciation of the Japanese yen have had a major impact on Japanese industry, which has faced major restructuring. As a beef producer, I was particularly interested to learn about Australia's marketing of beef in Japan, although it was very disappointing to discover Australian beef incorrectly labelled `Aussie beef: product of the United States of America' in one supermarket that we visited. It does not give me a lot of pleasure to mention that here today. Other people may want to get into the AMLC's beef promotion which, through its marketing efforts in Japan, has done a great job with Aussie beef. So, obviously, the Aussie beef program is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Japanese are learning the importance of lean beef. Over time, this will have a significant impact on the feedlot industry here in Australia. Australian beef producers would do well to understand the Japanese trend towards lean beef. In Japan there is a potential for a 10 per cent increase in the beef market. From discussions I had on the matter, I believe that we will see more of the 90-day grass fed beef going in. It was made very clear to us that five points&mdash;quality, TV promotion, pricing, taste, and the overall promotion of our beef&mdash;will be paramount in the future if we are to ensure that we keep that market because there will be competition from the Americans, the New Zealanders and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we can expand our beef sales in Japan if we pay attention to what Japanese consumers want. It does not matter whether we are talking about the delegation's visit or any other trip; it is very important to give consumers what they want, and more so in Japan. The maintenance of quality will be crucial to that future trade, and that is the weak link in Australia's export programs and something that we must work harder on and understand more about here at home. Maybe the cooperative research centre set-up in Armidale will help us move from finding out what the consumer wants back to finding out what type of grains should be fed to the animal. That will be very important in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool might have lost some ground but it is still a vital export worth just under half a billion dollars. In Japan we met with representatives of the Japan Wool Spinners Association and the Japan Wool Importers Association. Japan is increasing the imports of semi-processed wool and is interested in investing in processing plants in Australia. However, the representatives expressed concern about the need for Australian government cooperation in meeting environmental protection requirements. Of course, Japan's inventory has been down a little bit. Just recently there was a price surge and I hope that it does not go down any further in the next little while, because it is important that our countries remain together to keep that industry going well. The Japanese wool spinners are worried that the deregulation of the Australian wool industry may jeopardise quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other points that I think are worthy of note in presenting this report are that in Japan unemployment was about three per cent&mdash;in real terms, about five per cent. However, the point was made that businesses were still labour hoarding, that is, they were not putting off workers as they may need them in the future. That is a very interesting aspect which I took from some of my notes this morning. Interest rates are at about five per cent, which is excellent. Another interesting sidelight is that 85 per cent of the farms are run on a part-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electoral reforms in Japan will eventually give less influence to the farmers, which will be very good for the future of Australia's exports of coal. As for tourism, something like 600,000 Japanese visit Australia every year. Bali is a very big competitor to Australia. Traditionally, the Japanese have about a five- to seven-day holiday when they come to a country and they stay sometimes at one, two or three places. At one of our meetings it was brought up to us that it is important that we do not have bag handlers disputes because nothing annoys people more when they go to a country than to experience an industrial dispute. It spoils that very short holiday. So it is something we have to work at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that really impressed me was the flowers. I have never seen such wonderful, beautifully arranged flowers of such a high quality and standard as I saw in Japan. The one thing that Japanese really require is product of the highest standard, quality and consistency. We visited the Ota Flower and Vegetable Market. The flower market is worth $2 billion a year. That is a lot of money being spent on flowers but a lot of importance is placed on that area. The flowers change hands something like three times before they actually get onto somebody's mantelpiece or into an hotel or wherever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure that Senator West will elaborate more on this when she speaks in a moment: women in Japan are having fewer children, working longer and living longer. Less than one per cent of women are managers of businesses in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of interest was the new Kansai International Airport at Osaka, which we visited. That airport will make a big difference to the relationship between Japan and Australia by giving Australians and Japanese quick and good travel access between the two countries, especially the Osaka area which has great potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also visited the Asia-Pacific Trade Centre, which was very impressive. The bottom line for Japan is that the market is there and we will succeed in proportion to the effort we are prepared to put in. Marketing is the key for us in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following an outstanding time in Japan with the hospitality and absolutely exemplary organisation, we then went to Korea where there were international tensions in the political situation because of North Korea's non-adherence to the international atomic energy commitments. It did not preoccupy our minds when we were there but it was something that was going on at that particular time. The internal political situation was not as volatile as it was in Japan with the new Prime Minister and the fall of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there was some potentially destabilising domestic opposition to trade liberalisation in South Korea. That is understandable in light of the fact that the agricultural sector could decline there by some $10 billion. The future of trade between Australia and Korea will largely depend on the economic reform policies currently being pursued by that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I wish to identify myself with the remarks made by the leader of the delegation, the Speaker of the other place, in respect of the pace of the delegation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament can be assured that it got full value for money from us on the trip. I can attest to the pace of the meetings and the dinners.

I do not know how many visits there have been by Australian delegations to the Korean peninsula but there definitely should be a lot more than there have been&mdash;hopefully, every second year. I know the Speaker of the House of Representatives invited a delegation from the Korean parliament to return here next year. I hope that next year another delegation from the Australian parliament will go to Korea. If we are to be successful in the Republic of Korea, we have to build up a good rapport between Australia and Korea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One memorable part of the visit to the Republic was when we went up to the DMZ, the dividing line between South and North Korea. I was given the honour of walking on the Bridge of No Return&mdash;and I have returned, which I am very happy to say&mdash;which was really quite stimulating. I really felt the tension that exists between the two countries, the division that is there and the fact that everyone is eternally vigilant, watching out to see what is happening all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic of Korea is now about 50 per cent nuclear powered. That is something which should be of interest to our parliament. The country is really on the move: there are 500 new cars per day going onto the roads in Seoul, which is absolutely astounding when one thinks about it. It is astonishing to think that that number of new cars is rolling onto the roads all the time. When we look at the traffic, of course, we can understand what is happening. The fact that the Koreans are building 150 kilometres of new underground shows that they are meeting the challenge of the amount of transport that is needed in the city. By 1996 they hope they will have better tail pipe emission controls, which I believe will be a great help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opportunity to meet the President was another highlight of the trip. We do not often get the opportunity to meet people of that high rank. Obviously, that occurred because we were fortunate enough to be in a delegation led by the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with the Korean Worsted Spinners and Weavers Association. The Koreans said that demand for wool would be up and the price ceiling would be about or more than 700 cents. There is a big need for research and development in the wool industry. The Koreans are obviously now investing in the tops-making process in the Geelong area in Victoria where they have joint ventures. They are doing a good thing for Australia, I suppose, because we are value adding here and we are also able to give a good finished product to the South Koreans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My impression was that Korea was slightly behind Japan in trade liberalisation. I repeat that we must give the consumers the beef they want. It is a little harder to get beef into the Republic because it is a more restricted and controlled market. But we have to work these things out together and make sure that both our countries can prosper together, and I think that our visit will help to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the ambassadors here in Australia, both for the Republic of Korea and also for Japan, must receive our special thanks for the assistance they gave us in this delegation. I also thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade here in Australia for the briefings and the lead-up it gave us before we went on our trip. The department was very helpful and that help was much appreciated. I also thank Austrade, which gave us most welcome help and assistance.

Less than a week before we left for Japan, we were not sure whether that part of the trip would go ahead because there had been a change of Prime Minister. We were not sure whether there would be a general election or a peaceful and successful transfer of power from one party to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately for us, and for the Japanese too, they were able to show what a good democracy is, and that there can be a transfer of power from one political grouping to another without the need to go to the polls and without bloodshed. It can be done peacefully, amicably and in a way that means the country remains very stable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share Senator Brownhill's opinion that it is a stable coalition between the Social Democratic Party in Japan and the Liberal Democratic Party. I think it will last the full term. That is something that a lot of people initially were very sceptical about. They could not see how two groups, from what would appear to be extreme opposites of the political spectrum, could work together. But they appear to be doing so, the coalition appears very stable and that is a good thing for the country and the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were honoured to meet Tommiichi Murayama, the Prime Minister of Japan. I am sure that we were the first foreign group to do so. We beat the American dignitaries. There was coverage of this in the national Japanese media. We felt that we were accorded a great honour because, at that stage, Mr Murayama was two or three days away from being in Naples for the G7 conference. I thought it was a great honour for us that he took the time to meet a delegation from Australia, and we respected his doing that for us and showing us that courtesy. The Japanese were very keen to make sure we knew that it was business as usual in Japan: there had been no major shift in policy direction. That, of course, adds to the world's awareness of Japan being a stable country and the fact that a stable change of power had taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The make-up of the delegation was very interesting. We were basically rurally oriented. All of us, with the exception of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), had either a provincial or rural base. That meant that, as a group, we were able to discuss a number of primary industry and resource trade matters that concern this country so much. It was an honour to meet a number of those very important groups and people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of women and women's representation in those countries was also raised and looked at. Australia is not the only country that is underrepresented by women in its parliaments. I think just about every country in the world is. It was an honour for me to be able to meet Takako Doi, who was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in Japan and who is now the Speaker of the Japanese Diet. It was a very great honour to be able to talk to her about the issue of getting a greater representation of women in parliament and to know and learn that women parliamentarians in Japan have similar concerns to women parliamentarians in Australia about underrepresentation. I was also able to meet at official functions several other women who had been ministers in previous governments, and I met a woman who had been a head of Japan's diplomatic postings in the Scandinavian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brought home to me that there is a very great need for us to continue with the women's groups within both the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In any parliamentary group that is set up, the women parliamentarians must ensure that, if there is insufficient women's voice in the groups, they are able to form women's subgroups to make sure that women parliamentarians are encouraged to attend the organisations and enter parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it was a very interesting and exciting time to be in Japan. Another person whom I found very interesting to talk to was Ms Mariko Bando, the Chief Cabinet Councillor. She was certainly able to advise us of a number of the issues that confront Japanese women today&mdash;what their actions are, what they do, where they fit with sexual harassment, sexual discrimination and equal employment opportunity legislation, what penalties or lack of penalties they have with their legislation and what issues are confronting women in the workplace. As Senator Brownhill mentioned, women in Japan are, on the whole, marrying later and having fewer children. The Japanese birthrate is declining to about one child per family. Some concerns were expressed about that and what it means for the future. Those are issues that the Japanese have to approach and deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then moved on to Korea. Our visit to Korea took place three days after the death of the leader in North Korea, Kim Il-Sung. That was a time, of course, of great tension and people were not sure what was going to happen. When we got to South Korea one would not have known that there had been any sort of drama or any sorts of concerns about what was happening north of the border. It seemed very much business as usual. People were busy working. It was the middle of summer and it was very hot. People were still taking their weekends off to go down to the beach to seek respite from the heat. But it meant that it was an exciting time for us to be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the pleasure of meeting Kwang Nak Joo, who is now the Speaker of the National Assembly. Honourable senators may recall that last year Mr Kwang led a delegation to Australia in his capacity then as the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly. I had the opportunity to meet him then and it was a great honour to be able to meet him again in his more elevated capacity as the Speaker of the National Assembly. He is certainly an impressive gentleman, and someone with a very shrewd political knowledge. He is a very caring and powerful gentleman. It was a great pleasure to be able to meet somebody that we had seen before in Australia and to catch up on what had been happening since his elevation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that did strike me, and always strikes me when I go overseas to non-English speaking countries, is the necessity for Australians to learn to speak a language other than English. I am almost ashamed on occasions to say that English speaking countries have an attitude of almost assuming as a God given right that everybody else will learn to speak English. A lot of people in the countries we visited speak very good English. Some of them are educated in English speaking universities in the US, Canada and Australia. We do not seem to be doing anywhere near the same amount of work in the education area to ensure that we reciprocate. We are not doing enough to ensure that our students are able to speak any language, but particularly an Asian language because of the proximity of Asian countries and because those countries are very valuable trading partners. People who learn an Asian language also learn about the culture and the customs of the country and, of course, that knowledge is very essential when it comes to negotiating with and visiting a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visits such as the one made by our delegation are very important because they enable members of parliament to learn about the customs of countries. We were very fortunate in Japan to be able to visit some of the temples and shrines. Some of the temples and buildings that we saw are over 1,000 years old. The Buddhas are over 1,000 years old. We saw the largest bronze Buddha in the world. We saw the largest wooden building in the world, which was a pagoda. </PARA>

I would recommend such an experience to anybody because it gives one a greater understanding of the cultures of these countries and why people think and act the way they do. Visitors see shrines and churches and things like that. I found that was an important adjunct to this trip. We learnt about business and industry, but we also learnt about what innately makes those people what they are and why they hold certain beliefs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just presented arises from an unofficial visit to Taiwan by a group of senators and members who were returning from a bilateral delegation visit to Japan and the Republic of Korea. The visit to Taiwan had an unofficial status because an official visit is not possible under the terms of a joint communique agreed to in 1972 between Australia and the People's Republic of China, which established the basis for Australia's recognition of the People's Republic as the sole legal government of China. The communique acknowledges the position of the Chinese government that Taiwan is a province of the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at times difficult for us to see what difference, if any, our unofficial status made to the conduct of our visit. In many respects, our program in Taiwan was similar to that of our visit to Japan and South Korea. Certainly, the hospitality we received and the efforts made by our hosts were at the same high level and the support we were given by the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei was just as professional and just as valuable as the assistance provided by our embassies in Tokyo and Seoul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before commenting further on the nature of our visit, I would like to formally acknowledge the efforts of those who contributed to the success of our visit. I would like to place on record the delegation's sincere appreciation of the hospitality of our host and the assistance provided by the Legislative Yuan and the government of Taiwan. The visit was made in response to a generous invitation of the Legislative Yuan and, on behalf of the delegation and the Australian parliament, I thank the Legislative Yuan for the courtesy extended in that invitation and for the hospitality provided. Officers of the Legislative Yuan, particularly Dr Lee, worked very hard to organise our visit and thereby ensured its success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to record our appreciation for the highly professional work of the staff of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office, particularly Steve Waters. I also thank Senator Brownhill for his support as deputy delegation leader and our colleagues from the other place, the honourable members for Wannon (Mr Hawker), Paterson (Mr Horne) and Gippsland (Mr McGauran), for their contributions to the success of the visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other person who needs a big vote of thanks for the success of this is Mr Ian Dundas, who was the secretary of this delegation as well as the delegation to Japan and Korea. He spent many hard, long hours working at ensuring that everything ran like clockwork and with the precision that we had expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very successful conduct of our visit, despite its unofficial status, in many respects mirrored the nature of Australia's relationship with Taiwan. Although Australia does not formally recognise the authorities in Taiwan, we have a valuable, successful and nearly normal relationship with Taiwan, particularly in trade and personal contacts. In fact, our trade with Taiwan runs at a level virtually equal to our trade with the People's Republic of China. In 1993, the value of our trade with Taiwan was $5.1 billion, while our trade with the People's Republic of China was worth only slightly more at $5.2 billion. The lack of official recognition has clearly not prevented the development of a significant and fruitful relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taiwanese recently launched a program to try to normalise their place in the world, including membership of the United Nations. This may give rise to Australia considering how we respond to Taiwan's initiatives within the terms of our recognition of the People's Republic of China. For example, the authorities in Taiwan have renounced their claim to be the legitimate government of the whole of China and now accept that their authority does not extend beyond the territory that they actually control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia cannot and should not move unilaterally to put aside the joint communique with the People's Republic of China, but we should note that things are changing from the position in 1972 when the authorities of Taiwan vigorously maintained their claim to be the legal government of the whole of China. The government and official institutions are becoming more democratic and representative of the views of the people. Furthermore, Taiwan has developed into a major and independent trading economy. It has the second largest level of foreign reserves in the world and is the 15th largest trading power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The People's Republic of China will continue in the foreseeable future to oppose any bid for membership of the United Nations. In these circumstances, the best approach for Australia is to urge the PRC and Taiwan to resolve the problem themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best approach that Taiwan should take to assert itself in world affairs is a matter which is of much discussion within Taiwan itself. We noted while we were there&mdash;and this has continued since then&mdash;that there was a lively debate in the Legislative Yuan as to whether Taiwan should push its claim for United Nations membership under the name of `the Republic of China on Taiwan' or simply `Taiwan'. This is not an argument of semantics&mdash;there are strong differences about the nature of Taiwanese nationalism and how it should be expressed. The conservative view is that Taiwan is a part of China, albeit a part with a different government from that of the mainland, while the more radical view is that Taiwan is a separate country not necessarily part of some `greater China'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were there we had a meeting with the Legislative Yuan foreign affairs committee. The opinions that were expressed within that committee by the two key proponents are in marked contrast to one another and the debate on the differing points of view was very lively and robust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long run, emerging Taiwanese nationalism, in whatever form it takes, will increasingly pose some interesting questions for those countries that recognise the People's Republic of China but also want to maintain fruitful relations with Taiwan. The best outcome will be for some form of accommodation, if not reconciliation, between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. In the meantime, Australia will need to continue to give priority to our relationship with the People's Republic of China, not only because of its economic importance to Australia, which, as I have noted, is not that much greater than that of Taiwan, but because of its political and strategic importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude this part by noting that our visit extended the nature of Australia-Taiwan contacts in two important respects. For the first time, the Legislative Yuan was involved in planning and hosting a visit and we were accompanied throughout by an officer of the Legislative Yuan. I hope that this in part reflects an increasing appreciation of the value of specifically parliamentary exchanges and is perhaps also an indication of the emerging role of the Legislative Yuan. I believe that this is an important development because informal parliamentary visits can do much to fill out the relationship in the absence of more official government recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also say that the person who accompanied us, Dr Lee, was a PhD and doctor of law graduate of Sydney University. He had the most incredible command of the English language. He probably had a more extensive vocabulary than most of us here, and was just delighted when some of the members of our delegation decided to teach him some of the vernacular. He had a capacity for learning languages that I have not seen in anybody else. He was delightful company, intelligent and stimulating in his conversation, and also had a great sense of humour. He really made some of what was already a great trip even better by his great sense of humour and his ability to understand what we were saying. There were no communication problems because of his great English ability and the fact that he had been to Australia for his PhD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was one of very few university graduates that we found in Taiwan who had been through the Australian university system. I think that the Australian universities should look very much to their laurels&mdash;not rest on them, but look to improving the situation. It is a country that values tertiary education, and Australia has a lot to offer in this field. But the market seems to be cornered by the universities of the United States. I think the Australian universities could do well to have a very serious look at how they can actually improve their access to this particular form of marketing, this particular area of endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of our visit which I found extremely interesting was an excursion we made to Haulien county on the east coast, where we spent some time with members of the aboriginal community. The visit there was preceded by discussions in Taipei with some of the members of the Legislative Yuan who hold seats reserved for representatives of the aboriginal community. The warmth of the reception given to the delegation by the aboriginal people of Haulien and their eagerness to tell us about their lives and to show us some of their culture created one of the enduring memories of the delegation's tour, not to mention some of the more interesting photographs of the trip as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity to travel to Haulien was added to the delegation's program following an expression of interest in aboriginal issues by the delegation itself. This accommodation of our interest and the involvement of the Legislative Yuan in planning and managing our visit are good omens for the development of relations between the Australian parliament and the Legislative Yuan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, when we went to Haulien county, we were able to visit what I think has to be considered one of the great wonders of the world, and that is Taroka Gorge. It was 10 days after a major typhoon had been through, and all through Taiwan we could see signs of some of the damage that was still there. In Taroka, at the bottom of this gorge, which was quite literally hundreds of feet down from the road, the river was still running a steely, murky grey, but the rock formations and the sheer cliffs that followed this gorge were amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone is wondering why Senator Brownhill is signalling like that, within this national park there are monkeys. When we got to our luncheon spot we were able to actually see the monkeys gambolling around the treetops across the other side of the gorge. It was an exciting experience, because I do not think any of the other delegates had seen monkeys in the wild&mdash;certainly I had not. Also in this national park there are bears and I think there was a snake as well. We did not want to see the snake, but the bears were up in an area that we could not get to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gorge is absolutely magnificent. It is well worth a visit. It should be on all of the international spots of great beauty, because it is absolutely stunning. It was also stunning to see the power of this typhoon as it had washed away bridges. The river had risen so high that parts of the roadway that we were travelling on&mdash;a lot of which, I have to say, had been hewn by hand in the last 40 or 50 years&mdash;had been washed away and were having to be repaired. For me, this visit to Taroka Gorge was an absolutely unbelievable and memorable experience, in conjunction with the visit to the aboriginal people in Haulien. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank everybody involved in this trip for the hard work that was put in from the Australian end and by the people in Taiwan, the embassy of Yuan, and also by Ian Dundas, our secretary. It was a memorable trip. A number of the spouses came with us, and I think that added to our fun and enjoyment and our learning experience. We became like one big happy family. There was no acrimony and there was a lot of good camaraderie, good experience and good friendships that were made. I think that is what these sorts of trips are all about. They are not just about learning about the country which is being visited; they are about learning about our colleagues&mdash;and on this particular trip</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Taiwan is concerned, it is rather a matter of personal regret to me, as secretary of the Australia-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, that we were not able to conduct a proper official visit. That is something I may talk about in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first visited Taiwan in 1986. I noticed a great deal of change in the eight years since 1986, not the least being the fact that so many more people now are driving motor cars compared with when I had been there previously, when people rode about more on motor scooters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank our hosts in Taiwan for their courtesies and hospitality during our time there. Senator West has already mentioned Dr Lee. I was asked by one of my colleagues a little while ago whether I actually did teach any Australian slang to Dr Lee. I can assure senators that I did not. I am a very clear English speaker, even though I sometimes have trouble rolling my tongue around different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lee was a great help to us and gave us an insight into the modern Taiwan. Steve Waters, from Australian commerce and industry&mdash;our representative there, as Senator West said&mdash;was absolutely outstanding in giving us an insight into the country. That is what these delegations and these trips are all about. We go to learn about other countries, and we invite back to Australia people from those countries so that they may see what we have to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very informative program. We met with senior ministers, government officials and business leaders. In doing that, we did not have too much spare time, although the spare time we had was very much appreciated. We did see things that we requested to see. Taiwan is not just an industrial country; it is a country of great beauty, as Senator West has already indicated. Taiwan is our fourth largest trading partner in Asia. It is our seventh largest trading partner overall, with a total of something like $5.1 billion in world trade. It is good to see the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) in the chamber at the moment because he knows the importance to us of Taiwan as a trading nation. He knows we must keep our trade going well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade is certainly in our favour at the moment, with a surplus of just under half a billion dollars. We export unprocessed foods and raw materials to Taiwan, although we are exporting increasing amounts of elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;and that is important for Australia. From Taiwan we buy office machines, computers, metal products, textiles, electrical machinery, sporting goods, games and toys. It is a vibrant country and we must recognise its strong commercial links with Australia, despite the lack of recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a guest of Jerome Yen, I was able to be present last week here in Canberra at Taiwan's 83rd anniversary celebration. At that function, former Senator Brian Archer expressed hope that it would not be too long before Taiwan was able to take a place in the United Nations. There is evidence in Taiwan of a review of that position. We have to remember that Taiwan has been restructured. It is changing its position in terms of full membership of the United Nations; it has to come into the mainstream of world politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taiwanese believe that they are a continuation of the republic of 1912. There is a feeling among some people in Taiwan that countries with populations of only 100,000 are members of the United Nations, whereas Taiwan, with 21 million people, is denied such membership. Because Taiwan is denied a position in the world forum, it is being excluded from international and multilateral arrangements. Its status of recognition obviously will be addressed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our bilateral relations with Taiwan are magnificent in that we now have direct air links. The fact that we could fly back directly from Taiwan to Australia was a big change and I am sure will help our relationships in the future. Senator West already mentioned our visit to the east coast and to the aboriginal areas where some 266,000 hectares of country, about seven per cent, has been set aside for the aboriginals of the area. The hospitality that we received in that neck of the woods is something I will remember for the rest of my life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 50 per cent of beef in Taiwan is imported. That is an area where Australia must remain vigilant to try to make sure that we get our share of any increase in imports. I had visited the Taipei World Trade Centre once before. It was great to visit it again, along with visits to China Steel and other places I had visited before. There are 800,000 farmers in Taiwan. As a farmer myself, I took a great interest in meeting farmers there. Farmers comprise about 3.8 per cent of the work force of that country, whereas here in Australia our farming community comprises only 0.64 per cent of the total community. We must be cognisant of comments by the leaders of Taiwan that agriculture holds the key to national development. The Taiwanese lead the world in fish farming. They are good performers in tourism and trade generally, but they are bad performers as far as we are concerned in terms of education and investment in Australia. Those are areas in which we must work hard in putting Australia's case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must regard the subject of education as a serious export to countries such as Taiwan. I believe it is one of the areas that we have to work hard at as a country. We must seek to ensure that other countries of the world want to send people here to gain tertiary education, and in so doing to meet Australians. One hopes that when such people get to the top of their companies or make achievements in their lives, they will want to build on their relationships with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia need prestige and quality-seeking universities rather than price conscious educational institutions. We need universities that are more coordinated and which have less rivalry when trying to sell their education facilities to Taiwan or any other parts of the world. We have to have the Oxfords or Cambridges here in Australia because that is what the Taiwanese are looking for when they go overseas. They want a university of prestige. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our trade with Taiwan suffers from the lack of political willpower. Business does react to politicians and we as politicians have to push more to further our trade with Taiwan&mdash;and I am talking about here and now. Certainly Taiwan should not be ignored but often is. We should be working hard at improving our links with Taiwan. We must sell our Australian culture&mdash;and that is not happening in some of the countries we visited&mdash;to get it known to the people in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much needs to be done in Taiwan in terms of the environment. Since 1986, when I was last there, the Taiwanese have started to rectify some of the problems. There has been quite a change but there is still a lot to be done. There is a niche for Australia to be in on the side of environmental changes. When this morning I scanned the official itinerary for the delegation's visit, I noticed that our pace was just as constant in Taiwan as it was anywhere else. It was very worthwhile. The fact that my fellow travellers all arrived home very tired showed that we worked hard and learnt a lot. I hope one day that we can return to re-examine what is happening there. I hope that some of the people who come here from Taiwan will learn that we want to be their big trading partners. I again wish to thank my fellow travellers. I also thank the secretariat, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade people and others here in Austrade who gave us good briefings on Taiwan before we went.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we adjourned this debate we were debating the opposition's amendment No. 5, which deals with the definition of an organisation. At the time the debate was adjourned I was saying that letters carried between offices of an organisation may not now be able to be carried in the same way as before and that this may impose an extreme penalty on some.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can quote one example which demonstrates the absurdity that arises even in the context of partnerships. I refer to the firm of Sly and Weigall, the lawyers who act for Ausdoc who appeared before a committee hearing. That law firm comprises one partnership of which the Sydney partners and the Canberra partners are members. Accordingly, a letter can be sent by courier from the Sydney office to the Canberra office of Sly and Weigall. That comes under the exceptions because it is within the definition of an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just so happens that, for historical reasons, the Melbourne office of Sly and Weigall is a separate partnership. Neither the Sydney office nor the Canberra office could have a letter couriered to the Melbourne office unless it came within one of the other exceptions relating to price and weight&mdash;it would have to go by Australia Post. Other organisations affected are state governments. Under the definition of organisation&mdash;I guess this also applies to the Commonwealth government&mdash;separate departments are regarded as separate organisations so document exchanges cannot take place between two departments by an end to end service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has moved this amendment because we believe it gives us a much tidier definition of organisation and certainly one which would benefit the majority of those people who use document exchanges for the purposes that I described earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Ferguson said, this amendment seeks to broaden the definition of organisation for which internal mail is made an exception to the reserve services. It is an attempt to open more of the reserve services to competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were considering this amendment before lunch Senator Ferguson said that he would like to know the Australian Democrats' basic reason for not supporting this amendment. The basic reason is that Senator Ferguson and the opposition would like to see Australia Post deregulated to as large an extent as possible and we would rather see Australia Post stay where it is as far as regulation goes. That is the reason for the position we have taken in relation to this amendment. A line has to be drawn somewhere. Wherever we draw the line, there will be drawbacks and it will look somewhat artificial. But we feel that the line might as well be drawn here, where it is. We think this bill already goes too far in deregulating Australia Post and we will not support any further deregulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the government I indicate that we will not accept the opposition's proposed amendment. I make the following points. We note that the opposition is not content that we have agreed to allow the carriage of mail between offices of the one organisation to permit a company to contract out its internal mail deliveries. The opposition now wants to ensure that this step towards liberalisation is extended way beyond the scope intended by the government's phased approach to competition. The current act reserves to Australia Post the collection and delivery of organisations' letters unless the organisations use one of their own employees now that the mailbag may be contracted out in certain circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not propose to provide greater liberalisation at this time nor approve any current illegal practices. The amendment takes no account of the fact that the bill deliberately sought to place both the public and private sectors on the same footing. The opposition amendment is therefore inconsistent with that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in this legislation are best seen as a transitional stage to test competition in the letters market, ensuring Australia Post is still able to meet its community service obligations. There will be further opportunity to revisit these issues in the 1996-97 review of competitive arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The real concern in our moving amendment No. 5 is that the current definition of an organisation in the proposed legislation is much too narrow and, in particular, does not treat a company and its subsidiaries as a single body. It is also of significance that the definition treats state government departments as separate organisations. Therefore, the transport of mail between departments within a state government&mdash;in particular, the concern of the Victorian government has been raised in relation to this matter&mdash;would not be able to be undertaken by a private contractor. It would have to be reserved for Australia Post under the legislation as it is drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a Senate committee hearing on this legislation the minister responded that the existing legislation does not prevent employees of an organisation from delivering mail. But that is not sufficient in our view. We want organisations to be able to contract out the delivery of their mail when that mail is being delivered between various sections of an organisation&mdash;whether it is between different offices of the one company, between a company and its subsidiary or various subsidiaries, or, as I have already indicated, between departments of a state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved this amendment to ensure that there is a broader definition of organisation, so that related bodies within the meaning of the Corporations Act 1989 will be able to contract out the carriage of mail between their various constituent parts. We believe that is only reasonable. Again, if the government is really interested in reducing the costs in the business environment so that Australian businesses can be as efficient and competitive as possible, this amendment ought to pass through the Senate and be incorporated into the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australia Post explanatory notes in relation to the bill indicate that the proposed interconnection arrangements will apply only to bulk mail which crosses state borders. This restriction discriminates against larger states. For example, interconnection discounts may apply to bulk mail that is transported by private contractor between Sydney and Melbourne, but not to bulk mail transported from Cairns to Brisbane&mdash;which is nearly one and half times the distance. This amendment seeks to ensure that interconnection discounts are not restricted to interstate mail. I think the rest is self-explanatory without my going into any further detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept the amendment proposed by the opposition. It is unnecessary because the bill does not limit the application of the rate reductions to apply to the bulk mail interconnect service. The current terms and conditions only include interstate rates and are a commercial decision by Australia Post. It reflects the assessment that there are no savings to Australia Post on intrastate transportation by other operators.</PARA></TALK.START>

If anyone wants intrastate discounts and Australia Post declines, that person can ask the TPC to arbitrate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Chapman looks at the recent record of the Trade Practices Commission under the chairmanship of Professor Fels&mdash;who is a great devotee of Hilmer competition policy, et cetera&mdash;I would be staggered if a private operator could not get a fair shake out of the TPC on what was a competitive rate for intrastate services provided by Australia Post. If Australia Post tries to jack it up and overcharge to knock the private operator around, I think an application to the TPC, in view of its recent track record, would be looked upon very favourably. I am sure that after one or two rounds with Professor Fels and his gang at the TPC, Australia Post would quite rightly learn its lesson and not try to use the system to put private operators at a disadvantage. I think that is a new provision that ought to be acknowledged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that response. I simply make the point that one of the companies that gave evidence to the committee, Mayne Nickless, expressed the view that intrastate work was the component of total cost that was most likely to benefit from competition. Therefore, Mayne Nickless put to the committee the argument that the intrastate segment for bulk mail, as well as the interstate segment, ought to be opened to competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talked about the Trade Practices Commission, but the Prices Surveillance Authority also expressed concern that discounts will apply only if the bulk mail has been transported interstate by a private mail operator and not intrastate.

It is for that reason that we have moved this amendment, which I believe is worthy of support. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason that we did not propose to the PSA that intrastate be included was due to a matter of clarity and simplicity within our price structure.</PARA>
<PARA>In that evidence, which is set out on page 27 of the report, Mr Ludlow made it pretty clear that he was speaking on behalf of Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on record some further points about this issue. The government agrees that Australia Post be required to provide additional discounts to bulk mail customers based on Australia Post's estimate of the average transport cost per letter avoided by Australia Post in respect of letters lodged for delivery under the bulk mail interconnect service. The main costs avoided by Australia Post are on transport. Discounts will continue to be provided separately for bulk mail lodgments that are pre-sorted and where mailers undertake some other part of the service instead of Australia Post. Under this service customers will have the choice of using operators other than Australia Post who may charge less than Australia Post for the transportation of mail to a point close to the point of final destination, or be able to ensure that mail is transported to a certain location for final delivery by a guaranteed time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post will publish discount schedules which will be made available at post offices, with different rates expected to apply for letters delivered in the same state of lodgment from those lodged for delivery in another state.

However, the post office agents say that Australia Post itself effectively discounts by allowing bulk mail and advertising discounts. In effect, it is doing exactly the same thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for the prohibition on discounts in the retail price of stamps is to ensure that all people can have access to a standard letter service at a uniform rate of postage. This is the case whether they buy stamps from Australia Post or from a licensed post office or post office agent. It is not equitable that a person buys stamps from one postal outlet at one price, while another person pays a higher or lower price for the same service elsewhere.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Bourne was spot on when she said this place would be the first to move to censure the minister if he did not act decisively if something went wrong and the director did not properly inform the minister. We have already had a number of cases&mdash;certainly all the cases in which I have been involved in this place&mdash;of the Senate censuring ministers, I think inappropriately. The difficulty we always have with the current opposition is that, if a minister does take the appropriate action, he or she gets condemned or censured. If he or she does not take the appropriate action, he or she gets censured. In the context in which we are moving with government business enterprises, the minister must be expected to be able to have the power to deal with a director who does not keep him informed in the appropriate manner, as outlined in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will obviously not accept the amendment. The amendment proposes the removal of the new provisions requiring the Governor-General to dismiss any director who, in the opinion of the minister, fails to comply with an obligation under sections 41, 46 or 47. Section 41 requires the preparation of an annual report, sets out audit requirements and requires tabling by the minister. Section 46 requires the board to notify the minister of significant business activities, including the formation of subsidiaries requiring substantial business, and taking on a significant new business activity. Section 47 requires the board to keep the minister informed of the operations of Australia Post and to provide such information or reports relating to those operations. It is very basic, business-type information on which one would expect a director to keep a minister fully informed. If the director did not, I think there would be a good case, depending on the circumstances, for the minister to deal with the director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions reflect government policy to apply to all Commonwealth authorities and companies. They do not provide the minister with any particular leverage over the board. The legislation in which these provisions will be given general effect, the companies and corporations bill, has been examined by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and it did not comment on these provisions. So we strongly believe that this amendment should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no doubt, as Senator Ferguson said in moving this amendment on behalf of the opposition, that clause 25 of the bill as it is currently drafted gives undue discretion and undue power to the minister to terminate the appointment of a member of the board of Australia Post. The legislation clearly extends the circumstances in which a minister may recommend to the Governor-General, and, in effect, require the Governor-General, to terminate the appointment of a director of the board of Australia Post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne referred to section 79 of the existing act, which provides the conditions under which the appointment of a director may be terminated. As I read those conditions, they appear to me to be quite adequate. In essence, apart from misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity, the Governor-General shall terminate a director's appointment where the minister is of the opinion that the performance of a particular director has been unsatisfactory for a significant period of time. I believe that strikes the correct balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions earlier in the debate when we proposed amendments the various ministers at the table said, `The opposition in its amendment wants us to go further with this legislation, the Democrats don't want us to go as far as we have gone, but we believe as a government that we have struck the right balance with this legislation.' In relation to this issue, I believe the existing act strikes the right balance. It sets out reasonable conditions under which the appointment of a member of the board of Australia Post may be terminated&mdash;that is, where the minister is of the opinion that the performance of a particular director has been unsatisfactory for a significant period of time. In other words, the government can monitor the performance of the board and individual directors. If, over a period of time, it believes they are not complying with the requirements of the legislation and fulfilling their duties adequately as directors, they can be sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause in the amending bill gives the minister the opportunity to much more capriciously sack a member of the board. We believe that is unreasonable and unsatisfactory because it is much more dependent on the immediate opinion of the minister than the opinion the minister may have developed over a period of time. So it does open itself up to capricious behaviour on the part of the minister. It gives the minister undue power and discretion and therefore effectively gives the government an undesirable degree of leverage over Australia Post's corporate operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe for those reasons, and the fact that it creates a dangerous precedent, that this extension of the circumstances for the sacking of members of the board should not be supported. As an alternative, the amendment proposed by the opposition ought to be supported, which will prevent the proposed extension of the circumstances under which the appointment of a board member may be terminated. </PARA>

The audit results and service improvement plans would then be tabled in parliament. Standards could cover the frequency, speed or accuracy of mail delivery, the availability of mail lodgment points or the availability of retail postal services&mdash;for example, through post offices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly will not be opposing this amendment, but I would like to make one comment. In moving this amendment, Senator Bourne spoke about trying to improve services to rural and remote areas. Earlier, we tried to move an amendment to ensure some immediate improvement, particularly to roadside delivery services. The Democrats talk about wanting performance standards and audits in place before those improvements in services to rural and remote areas can take place. I think it is only delaying what might be available to those people already.

To safeguard rural postal services, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) announced in a joint press statement in February this year a parliamentary review of Australia Post's community service obligations which is to be completed once in each parliamentary term. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to contribute to the review, which will provide these communities with an opportunity to have a direct say in their postal services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the current Austudy-Abstudy supplement introduced on 1 January 1993, voluntary student loans are available to tertiary students who wish to trade in part or all of their Austudy-Abstudy benefits for an interest-free loan of twice the amount of benefit traded. The Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill removes the existing repayment deadlines so students who have received Austudy payments can repay all or part of the benefit at any time during the year in order to maximise the amount of their supplementary loan. The bill also makes supplementary loans available to students who do not currently qualify for Austudy due to the spouse income test, provided that the spouse's income is less than $35,000. The coalition does not oppose these new provisions to the Austudy-Abstudy supplement scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the second reading debate on this bill commenced on 20 September, the coalition moved a very important amendment designed to address the great social inequity of rural students being excluded from participating in tertiary education. The intent of the coalition's amendment was to exempt the Austudy assets test for farm families declared to be in exceptional circumstances during the period of that declaration. I am heartened that the government finally acknowledged this great injustice in its drought relief package that it brought down on 21 September, with the commitment to remove the assets test for all families in exceptional drought areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will provide relief for many people. I just do not know how many people; I expect it will be 7,000 or 8,000 when all the applications are in. Last week in Queensland, 3,000 applications came in, and I know many more will come in. It has given those people some relief out there to know that their children will receive a tertiary education. However, we do believe that the government's measures do not go far enough. We will persist in moving our amendments to exempt the Austudy assets test for farm families in exceptional circumstances, because this exemption will also encompass the farm families struggling on low or zero incomes due to exceptional circumstances but not necessarily drought induced exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of people now on wool exceptional circumstances. Wool exceptional circumstances funding finished on 30 June but there are still 1,900 people accessing funds under those wool exceptional circumstances. Under the government's drought package those people would be ineligible to receive Austudy for their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment would also benefit farm families in South Australia and Victoria suffering from exceptional circumstances beyond their control such as severe frosts, destroyed harvests or things of that nature. We also have grave concerns about the prospects of rural young people who are living in regions not currently declared severely drought affected but which have been drought affected in the past and, as a result, whose families are struggling to meet their commitments as they are still paying off debts that they have built up over a period of very high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's new Austudy provisions in the drought relief package will not help those young people. In order to alleviate the barrier that rural youth have traditionally faced in accessing tertiary education, the coalition twice moved an amendment to a student assistance bill earlier in the year to waive the Austudy assets test to all holders of a health care card, which was issued by the Department of Social Security to low income earners. We moved that amendment twice, and I understand that the Democrats will move a similar amendment today. We will support the amendment moved by Senator Bell because, in effect, it is the same as the amendment that we moved previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key government budget commitment last year was to exempt the Austudy assets test for all health care cardholders. The commitment was stated in various Department of Employment, Education and Training publications, including the Austudy application form, the Austudy guide to student finance, the DEET budget kit and a DEET press release. Those are four commitments that the government made to students who could not access Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people out in rural Australia who could access a health card. Some have accessed the card and some are struggling not to do it. That was a commitment given in black and white in the budget, and the government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, reneged on that. He came in and apologised and said that it was a departmental mistake and he had nothing really to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of that goes on in the Labor Party. People in departments make mistakes&mdash;and we have seen it in respect of the CAA today&mdash;where ministers will just not accept the responsibilities of their departments. They do a Pontius Pilate and say, `Well, it really isn't our fault because the department made a mistake.' Under the Westminster system, the minister is responsible for his department and he must either honour the commitment of his department or resign. The minister responsible for education certainly has not resigned. Many students thought they would be able to undertake their tertiary education, given the commitment of the health care card, only to have their hopes dashed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government broke this commitment on 7 February, 1994 with no public announcement whatsoever. It broke the commitment when the Austudy officers were advised by an internal memo that the assets test was to be applied to all applications. With this callous revocation, the government smashed the hopes and aspirations of a number of young people. I have spoken to these young people and, in fact, some of them have gone on television to present their case to the people. I believe the young people who did that certainly put pressure on the government in such a way that the government had to respond with a drought relief package that included some assistance to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, I believe the Democrats have picked up this amendment, which was carried twice in the Senate, in the face of unmoving opposition by the government. The government has laid that bill aside. The coalition will obviously support the amendment moved by Senator Bell, as it is the same as our original amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus is squarely on the government to support these crucial amendments to the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill in the committee stage. The government has gone some way to giving these young children an education, particularly the ones in drought affected areas. But there are many children who will still not be able to access Austudy. This is of the greatest concern to all primary industry people at the moment, as they go through very difficult times and struggle with the drought and struggle to feed their sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what goes through their minds now is, `If I can get my children a decent education, a tertiary education, maybe they will not have to do this in the difficult times. At least if I do this for them and give them that tertiary education, if they do not want to come back on the farm and go through the agony that we are going through now, they will have an option.' The main concern for primary industry people at the moment is to get their children educated with a tertiary degree that will be acceptable in the wider community and that will give them the option of going back on the farm or having the opportunity to go out and get a job in other areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government, in hope rather than expectation, that it should support these amendments. We will put the amendments and they will go to the other house. By bringing on this drought relief package, the government has created the situation, unwillingly and unknowingly, where some 16- to 18-year-old children who are in the worst affected drought areas are allowed access to education. They can go to university, TAFE or somewhere else, but the children who are not in what is decreed by a declaration to be a drought declared area will not be able to access Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there will be two types of young people in rural Australia. Those in the drought declared areas will be able to go to university or TAFE, and many of the ones who are not in those areas will not be able to go. I ask the government to consider the implications of the drought relief package. The package is welcomed&mdash;I am not knocking it&mdash;but I say that other people will not be able to access Austudy unless these amendments are passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to Senator Boswell's concerns in a moment. This is achieved through the provision of financial assistance to students who would not otherwise be able to continue their education. The student assistance budget has doubled since 1987. Expenditure has grown from $750 million in 1987-88 to an estimated $1.663 billion in 1994-95. In 1994-95 it is expected that 553,860 students will be assisted, compared to 536,390 in 1993-94. They are very basic and fundamental facts that are important to remember in the context of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her contribution, Senator Margetts raised the issue of rent assistance. As has been mentioned before, the government announced in the budget that rent assistance would be extended to homeless Austudy and Abstudy recipients. Extension of rent assistance to all students receiving away from home and independent rates would be very costly and needs to be considered in the context of other government priorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have to say that Senator Boswell has a very good relationship with the government. But the opposition is not always right. I think what has to be emphasised is that, even though Senator Boswell has recognised the drought relief measures that were announced a fortnight ago as being well targeted towards those areas in this country critically affected by drought, that does not necessarily mean from a government perspective that we can automatically carry those measures over to everyone outside the drought affected areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the elements of that package affect Austudy. With the introduction of the drought relief payments, the government has addressed the needs of drought affected farm families with nil or low incomes but highly valued on-farm assets which may have prevented them from getting Austudy. Farming interest groups have, for some time, been seeking such a concession for farm assets, and these measures address this request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to outline the coalition's position in relation to this bill. It is to be noted that this bill relates to a number of pieces of legislation. The coalition notes these amendments and supports them, of course, in that they were brought to the attention of the Senate by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I believe the aspect of delegation in relation to the warrant is an important aspect in that the delegation is changed from an officer to a senior officer. I think that in any aspect of delegation the government must be terribly careful that, where it is dealing with the delegation of power to authorise such warrants, it be to a person of sufficient seniority and not just anyone; we do not just delegate to the office boy the ability to authorise a warrant. Therefore, the coalition supports the amendments. I note that for the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the bill in general terms. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and, in particular, the two aspects dealing with the amendment of sentencing principles and with penalty in the Crimes Act were canvassed. I might say that they are perhaps the most salient points to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would indicate that the coalition agrees with the inclusion of cultural background in relation to sentencing principles. I believe that is an aspect which is relevant in a country such as Australia, where there are diverse cultural backgrounds. In my state of Western Australia there have cases where tribal Aboriginals have been dealt with before the courts and, of course, they have operated under a different cultural background. They have also had to face some sort of penalty from their own tribe and clan. Also, some aspects of a culture bring out different sorts of behaviour in people, and that has to be recognised. In particular, this relates to Aboriginal offenders, but it could apply to anyone in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is not a defence, and I state that quite clearly. It is by way of a sentencing principle. I recently spoke to a judge who said that perhaps we are enumerating too many principles for sentencing and that we should just leave it to commonsense. I agree with that but in relation to the legislation on the books, we already have a number of matters such as the nature and circumstances of the offence, the degree to which the offender has shown contrition and the degree to which the offender has cooperated with the law enforcement agencies. If this were not included, it would appear that parliament was saying that was not such an important aspect to be considered. Therefore, I think it is very important that it be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the amendment to the penalty provisions of the Crimes Act is sensible. I believe from my own experience that, if someone does breach a recognisance or a security, there should be a range of options available to the court in sentencing that person. It is much as if someone is on probation. The state that I come from, Western Australia, does not have a suspended sentence provision. Other states might have, although not all of them. If people breach such a recognisance or if they cannot pay reparation or restitution, the court should be left with the matter to deal with afresh and should have that ability to provide a range of options of sentencing from imprisonment, to a further suspended sentence, to a fine, to perhaps probation, although the Commonwealth does not have probation as the states know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to other aspects of the bill, there are amendments to the Transfer of Prisoners Act dealing with the ACT so that prisoners can be included in the transfer of prisoners scheme operating in Australia. I think that is a sensible amendment. The amendment to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 is sensible in allowing the Australian Federal Police officers on Christmas Island to receive such reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to go any further into the detail of those other amendments; suffice to say that the main issues, I believe, are the sentencing principles that I have outlined and the penalty provisions, which I think are a step in the right direction. A court should always be given as much choice as possible in relation to sentencing. I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

It was brought to the attention of the Senate by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as Senator Ellison has said. If the government had not moved this amendment, we would have. We believe it is very important for the government to ensure that, when authority and power is delegated, it is done so in a carefully circumscribed manner. The class of persons to whom the delegation is given must be clearly defined. Obviously, the highest possible level of competence must be chosen for such delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of cultural background, which was one of the matters referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Democrats welcome that amendment. The evidence before the committee was overwhelmingly in support of including cultural background. I believe that is a relevant matter in the sentencing of federal offenders. I think we need to make that distinction and take it into account when guilt or innocence is determined by the court. That has certainly not been the case. The bill seeks to introduce it simply as a matter to be taken into account when the sentence is under consideration by the court. </PARA>

There were times when we were going home early because the government did not have any bills. I have had bills ready for weeks. Day after day I come here ready to do bills and they are shifted off because those opposite cannot organise their program. I will make a contribution to assisting, but I cannot let this matter pass without making a few remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment circulated is the one saying that we cannot go ahead with a prosecution for a false complaint if the ombudsman does not want us to go ahead; it has to be referred to the Attorney-General. That amendment has been taken up as a consequence of a very sensible reference of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Yet again, it may be only in a small way, but somebody's rights are being protected because senators in their committee work did their job. I suppose we have to have a bit of good grace and say that the government had the good sense to listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some second thoughts, momentarily, having agreed with this amendment myself, that I would like to put on the record, because other people may have the same second thoughts and it may mean later that we will have to look at it. My second thoughts were these: when we establish a DPP, we want an independent person looking at whether prosecutions should proceed or not. We say that a DPP should have the job rather than the Attorney-General because we want to de-politicise the prosecution process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are actually saying here is that in the end it will be the Attorney-General&mdash;in some cases&mdash;who decides. We are saying that the Attorney-General should have the matter referred to him or her, as the case may be, but in these circumstances it is the AFP who would want to pursue a prosecution against a citizen and it would be the AFP's credibility at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite might say that the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice is responsible. As they come under the same portfolio, in the end the Attorney-General is responsible. The point is that the Attorney-General is going to be more independently minded, we assume, than the AFP itself. That is the only basis on which we recommend this&mdash;if those opposite understand the point I am making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally we would say, `Let's keep the Attorney out of prosecutorial things.' But we say that it is different in this instance because the prosecution, on behalf of the AFP, is by an arm of the government against a citizen. That is different, I think, from the normal circumstances. In any event, the Attorney is going to be more objective&mdash;we hope&mdash;than the AFP necessarily could be, since it is against the AFP that the false complaint is allegedly made. That was the first point I wanted to make, having rushed into the chamber because the government's agenda is all over the joint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other points I want to make. Some time ago the Australian Federal Police asked for a review. That request was made in April 1989. I was in this parliament then but it was five years ago, heading on for six. It was not until 1991 that the government established a working party to look at the Federal Police concerns, as part of a review of the act as a whole. Mr Temporary Chairman, if you are concerned about the relevance of my remarks, I am speaking to the title. The working group considered proposals from interested parties and considered the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration review of the ombudsman's office. Honourable senators will remember that a request was made in 1989 by the AFPA for these matters to be looked at. That did not happen until 1991. Now, about five years later, we have some legislation going through parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think the amendments do some good things. Unlike the Democrats, and in contrast to the view put to us by the Law Council, we support there being an offence of making a false complaint. </PARA>

It is easy to put them to great bother and effort as a consequence of a false complaint and then walk away laughing. That situation will now change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a request was made back in 1989, there was some delay before a review was conducted and then there was some further delay before the legislation was introduced. A Senate committee and the Attorney-General's Department have come in&mdash;Senator Spindler can correct me, but I am pretty sure about this&mdash;and said, `The minister has had a look at this and we think the whole thing needs to be reviewed.' It really does raise the question of when is this ever going to end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the minister and me it might not make much difference on a day-to-day basis, but I am quite sure it makes a difference to the officers of the Australian Federal Police. Since 1989 they have been asking for things to be fixed up. Having thought they might have got there, there is now going to be another review. It is just a constant process. I am not arguing that the government should stop reviewing things because it did not do it properly the first time&mdash;it does not want to be embarrassed by constant review. What I am arguing is that when it does the review, for heaven's sake do it properly in the first place. Clearly, that has not happened in this case. It simply shows that the responsible minister, Duncan Kerr, has not got a grip on this matter at all. He has let it drift; he is not sure where to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a bill coming forward that the AFPA has been looking forward to for some time, we find we have to say, `We will deal with those problems in the next review.' This is no way for someone to administer a portfolio; it is no way to deal with the Australian Federal Police; and, frankly, it is no way to deal with the parliament in terms of wasting its time. We will have to read another review and we will have to go through the process of looking at another bill which, if it was all done properly in the first place, might have been able to be done in one bite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, with the reservations I have added, we support the amendment. We think it is a good thing. We will have to watch and see how the new offence is dealt with and how many people get caught by it; and whether people feel confident to still make complaints, with this new offence hanging over their heads. I feel confident that members of the community will make complaints that are genuine and that all the provision of this offence will do is get rid of the non-genuine complaints&mdash;and that will be a good thing. </PARA>

<PARA>In respect of amendment No. 1, the Australian Democrats agree with the submission made by the Law Council of Australia that there should be a general privilege for information provided by complainants in complaints to the ombudsman. Such a privilege would preclude any statements made by a complainant in a complaint to the ombudsman being used in subsequent criminal proceedings. This is something we need to guard against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale of such a privilege is that there should be a clear separation between the criminal misconduct of a complainant and his or her complaint against police officers. Police officers should not be able to abuse their power in the knowledge that the victim was effectively silenced through fear that making a complaint might implicate him or her in criminal activity. The privilege would be strictly limited to information furnished to the ombudsman in relation to a complaint alleging police misconduct. Accordingly, I believe this is an important amendment, and I commend it to the committee. Amendment No. 2 circulated in my name&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to clause 16, which is the subject of amendment No. 3, the Australian Democrats believe that the power which such a clause would give to the commissioner of the AFP is undesirable, and that is the power to deal with the disciplinary process in-house, as it were, once a member of the AFP has pleaded guilty to a disciplinary charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the principle that such matters should always be dealt with in public by the Police Complaints Tribunal should not be given up.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is. I noticed that at that stage not much indication was given about what the split was between the various new research projects. I am pleased to say that page 41 of this year's report shows the split within the research projects. The previous year's report showed a total of $11.6 million for new research projects. It was unclear from that report how much money was spent on renewable energy research. Now we know how much was spent because this year's report states that in 1993 research into renewables totalled roughly $3.17 million. That was 27.4 per cent of the research dollars. That was a bit disappointing since we could perhaps expect around 50 per cent of the research money to go into renewables.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have found out from this year's report that that research funding has in fact gone down. It has gone down 26 per cent to $2.336 million. It has also gone down in percentage terms. It is down to 23 per cent of funding for research projects. So the commitment by the government in terms of research into renewables seems to be decreasing rather than increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do note, however, that there is a slight increase of roughly four per cent in funding going to research projects in planned energy use, or demand management. That has gone up from roughly 15.26 per cent of the total to 18.14 per cent. Whilst that is good, there is also a growing amount of information on energy management, how it can be achieved and how it saves money. I am sure the majority of these kinds of projects will say exactly that. The problem I see is that demand management, at both the state and federal levels, still has to be implemented through actual program changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a suggestion the other day&mdash;and I think it is a very good one&mdash;that the energy impact of every major new project, and especially every major capital works expenditure, should be part of the project and that the government should be required in every new proposal and every new major policy change to look at what the energy impact will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way some of these well researched demand management proposals of energy efficiency and energy conservation can be built into the way we plan our policies. Obviously we are getting a lot more information&mdash;which is good. However, we are stopping short of implementing that information. Instead of having a small demand management branch, what we have to do now&mdash;and what I am hoping the government will do as part of its response to the greenhouse strategy&mdash;is look at how demand management can be built into every major program and certainly every capital works program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice, however, that the research dollar in total has decreased from $11.5 million to just over $10 million. We are putting less into energy research than we were previously. It would appear that government revenue is increasing, but one wonders where it is going. Perhaps it is going into areas other than research. That seems to be the situation with a lot of research programs at the moment;  perhaps the development side may be taking over from some of the research side. We need to look into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Energy Research and Development Corporation is obviously an important body. It is vital that it sees that its role as involving energy trends and research that private industry is not involved in. If it involves fossil fuels there may not be a dollar in it. Certainly the best thing for Australia is to look seriously at energy reduction and the use of renewables. One can only hope that we will all seek to ensure that in this area Australia goes in the right direction. </PARA>

<PARA>I note that the Commission's charter is, amongst other things, to promote fair and open dealing between the insurance and superannuation industry and its customers. I note further in the report that the insurance commissioner attempts to maintain a close liaison with the general insurance industry, consumer bodies and other interested parties on issues affecting the industry and insurance policy holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere in the report, the insurance commissioner talks about a code of practice in relation to general insurance. The commissioner reports that in July 1993 the government announced its intention to establish a task force to develop a structure for a compulsory code of practice governing the relationship between insurers, intermediaries and consumers in the general insurance industry. Elsewhere the report talks about social justice, access and equity, and indicates that the commissioner's responsibilities for the administration of the Insurance Contracts Act will improve consumer protection, and the formulation of a general insurance industry code of practice will enhance social justice and equity for insurance consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read those matters in the report because I have raised with the insurance commissioner a matter of access to general insurance. I wrote to him on 4 October, the same day as I wrote to the Attorney-General and Senator Schacht about customs matters in the Torres Strait. I have not received a reply from the insurance commissioner. I am not criticising him because obviously it takes a while to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to raise publicly the difficulty that business people and home owners on Thursday Island find in getting any sort of insurance at all. I have raised this question with Suncorp Insurance, one of the biggest insurers in Queensland, and asked whether it was true. I am told by constituents on Thursday Island that they are simply unable to obtain general insurance. They tell me that it is practically impossible to obtain fire insurance. Insurance companies which provided that insurance in the past will not take contracts now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked my constituents whether they were able to get theft insurance, they just laughed at me and said that it was not worth asking about. As I have mentioned in this chamber previously, there is a lot of petty theft and some quite major theft occurring on Thursday Island. A lot of the things stolen from the shops on Thursday Island end up in New Guinea. That leads the local people to the conclusion that many of the stolen goods are being exchanged for drugs in New Guinea, and those drugs are then coming into Australia via the Torres Strait and Cairns. That is another aspect of the matter which I have taken up with the Attorney-General, and with Senator Schacht&mdash;if he ever gets around to finding it&mdash;and his department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfair that any Australians should find themselves in the position where they simply cannot get any insurance. There is a fire station on Thursday Island. The insurance companies should be aware that the people have some protection. Fires and, at times, violent tropical storms occur on Thursday Island. But these people are simply unable to insure against these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is terribly unfair. We must have a society where Australians, no matter where they choose to live or where they are forced to live, should have access to the same services and insurance cover as other Australians. The government should look into this matter. As I say, I have raised the matter with the commissioner and I eagerly await his response. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago the Department of Veterans' Affairs provided a briefing to me about the activities of the department, as one of my responsibilities is to handle Veterans' Affairs bills in the Senate. Air Vice Marshal Alan Heggin, Director of War Graves, provided details on the activities of the Office of Australian War Graves. I have since had the opportunity to use the services of the office and I commend its excellent work to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service records of World War I soldiers can now be obtained on application to Australian Archives. Indeed, I was pleased to read that some 700 files per month are now requested by the public seeking information on behalf of relations who served in the First World War. Where the individual was killed in action, the Office of Australian War Graves can provide the location of the grave. As it states in the annual report, for those unable to travel to the grave site, the office will arrange the provision of photographs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the work of the Australian Archives and, in particular, Kon Tsogas and his staff, I was able to obtain the service record of a relation, George Kemp&mdash;a young man in his early 20s who enlisted in 1915 and was killed in the second Battle of Bullecourt on 5 May 1917. The files were comprehensive and included key documents from his enlistment to the final tragedy of his death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Australian War Graves was able to provide me with the location of his grave at Queant, near Villers-Bretonneux in the north of France. The director, Alan Heggin, forwarded to me photos of the grave and last month members of my family were able to visit the cemetery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 416,000 Australians enlisted in the First World War, and there are some 21,000 First and Second World War graves in France. As these soldiers died at such an early age, many did not have the opportunity to have families of their own. Whereas the Australian War Memorial and the Office of Australian War Graves do so much to maintain a sense of their sacrifice, it is true that the memory of these brave soldiers has inevitably faded over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 75 years later, many of those who carry the same name as the World War One servicemen know little about the service record of their earlier relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I was able to obtain George Kemp's records, an uncle of mine, Len Kemp was the only person who could recall him. Len, as a young boy, visited George prior to his embarkation for Gallipoli.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information about young men like George can now be readily obtained thanks to the good work of Australian Archives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Australia Remembers Program is underway, I hope that greater use will be made of the office of War Graves and Australian Archives so that more Australians will learn about the sacrifice of their forebears and take the opportunity to visit their final resting place.</PARA>

It is an extremely moving experience to visit those sites. I had the great honour and privilege of laying wreaths at Lone Pine, Anzac Cove and the Turkish memorial on the Gallipoli peninsula late in July. It was amongst the more moving experiences in my life. It is a great tragedy that, just a few weeks after that, massive bushfires swept right through the Gallipoli peninsula and destroyed much of the foliage around the memorials.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Short, I would like to thank members of the Office of Australian War Graves who greatly facilitated my visit to Gallipoli. Their office at Canakkale in Turkey certainly provides enormous assistance to parliamentarians visiting that heritage area. It is an area of heritage not only of significance to Australia but also of significance to the Turks. It was where Kemal Ataturk first became the national hero, which role enabled him to bring Turkey very much into the 20th century and to create the basis on which it could become the dynamic nation it is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention, as Senator Short did, that damage of various kinds creates problems for the Office of Australian War Graves. The devastating fires at Gallipoli have been mentioned&mdash;in fact, I spoke at some length about them in this chamber. I also note from the annual report that local bandit or rascal activity in the Port Moresby area has necessitated the strengthening of security arrangements at the Bomana War Cemetery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that revised approach and entry arrangements have been introduced and security staff are on duty throughout each day. Visitor harassment has diminished markedly since the changes have been introduced. Although several instances of minor vandalism have occurred at facilities of the Office of Australian War Graves in Australia, these have been addressed promptly and rectified and so are not major problems. It is a concern that those problems in Papua New Guinea have emerged and I regret that the office has had to undertake that kind of expensive protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that there is still a determination to continue the program of upgrading many of the present assets&mdash;I suppose one can call them that; they are called assets in the annual report&mdash;of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, some of which are now over 45 years old. In particular&mdash;and this might interest Senator Margetts&mdash;the commission has installed solar power irrigation systems in six war plots.

The report mentions that there has been a replacement of agricultural drainage systems in Springvale war cemetery and in the South Australian garden of remembrance. What is important to recognise is that all of this activity&mdash;such as the sinking of a bore at the Bomana War Cemetery to provide an artesian-sourced irrigation system which should minimise reliance on Port Moresby water supply and achieve substantial savings in operational costs, along with the realignment of headstones and the restoration of stonework&mdash;means that there is still a continuing requirement for funding of this office. I am glad to see that this government is continuing with that funding.

<PARA>I take this opportunity to again protest against the government's mean-spirited and ill-advised approach to the funding of the CSIRO. As outlined in this report, CSIRO's priorities are now set in favour of mineral resources, manufacturing information and communications, and environment&mdash;leaving agriculture in limbo. CSIRO's primary industry research was hit hard when $60 million was sliced from its budget. These cuts are impinging on the future competitiveness of our agricultural export sector. This is a sector that still provides 25 per cent of our export dollars, and that is a figure that is often forgotten. It is a sector with a great deal of potential and a sector that has been neglected by this government for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export dollars that primary industry brings into this nation, and on which much of the infrastructure of the nation has been built, are still essential to reducing our current account deficit. In August we notched up a $2.1 billion current account deficit, the highest in five years, a level much greater than financial markets had tipped. I am told that the current importation of grain and the substantial reduction in primary industry exports will add $3 billion or $4 billion to the balance of payments problem for at least the remainder of the year. We have to face the fact that, if this nation were a business, the receivers would have moved in and changed the locks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, as announced in the Working Nation paper, the CSIRO funding cuts amount to $20 million per year being taken away from primary industry. This has not been helped by the worst drought since white settlement and the general rural recession, which have reduced primary industry contributions to agricultural research. It is interesting to note that a recent cost benefit analysis conducted by the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology showed that its recent activities provided a return of $123 for every research dollar spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cuts that I have talked about will mean that 138 jobs will be shed in the Institute of Plant and Animal Production. We must remember that these job cuts follow significant asset sales. While there is arguably some merit in the rationalisation of research sites, it is reckless to support massive cuts to research staff because of the difficulty of retraining when things turn around. This is a very big wastage from which we will be hard pressed to recover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Morale is at an extremely low level. The inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs into these cuts took evidence in Sydney, Armidale, Brisbane and Perth, with further hearings to be held in Melbourne and Canberra and an inspection undertaken at Geelong. The inquiry has taken 166 submissions, a large number of which came from disgruntled CSIRO scientists, rural land protection boards and farming organisations. All these people, from scientist to farmer, despair for the future of their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the inquiry's findings, due to be released by the last sitting day this year. I hope that the government, which vehemently resisted the inquiry, takes note of the findings. If funding matched primary industry's export status, the eight primary industry research divisions would have their budgets supplemented, not reduced. But no, agriculture bears the brunt of this government's cost cutting once again. The government's talk of enhancing regional Australia has been shown up as hollow rhetoric when decisions such as these are taken. If CSIRO facilities are closed in regional centres, as is presently happening, these centres will suffer enormously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak briefly to the annual report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I felt it important to attend one of the hearings of the current inquiry into research funding, especially in relation to rural research, that took place in Perth. A number of very interesting points came out during that hearing. Certainly, there is a change in the direction of a number of aspects of funding and there seem to be a number of reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it would seem that the push to privatise funding, or for CSIRO to gain a greater proportion of its funding from private sources, is having a negative effect on the total amount of research. Certainly, it would reduce the amount of research being done in rural areas because of the lack of dollars in the rural sector to provide for CSIRO projects.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I attended the funeral of one of the most decent, honourable, dedicated, hardworking, effective and community spirited people I have known. He was Lieutenant Colonel Fred Evans, MBE ED JP, who died, aged 81, on Saturday at the Culburra Retirement Village that he had done so much to establish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a man who in retirement achieved more than most people achieve in a lifetime of work. His sense of service, which carried him into a distinguished career in the army, also prompted him into making an unparalleled contribution to the quality of life in the Culburra region on the south coast of New South Wales after his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Memorials to Fred Evans abound in Culburra, not only by way of the bricks and mortar, the buildings and institutions, the very existence of which depended on his initiatives, but also in the hearts of all the residents who accepted his leadership, who responded to his enthusiasm, who acted on his encouragement to get things done and who have benefited accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years Fred Evans had been forced to relinquish many of his formal roles in the community because of ill health. Nevertheless, and despite the directions of his doctors, he continued to play a key advisory role in a wide range of activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was Fred Evans's local federal member of parliament, as member for Macarthur from 1975 to 1983, I quickly became aware of his vision for his area and his determination to achieve it. His strength of purpose was matched by his remarkable courtesy. It was almost a pleasure to be pressured by him to take up his causes. It was a rewarding experience to be gently and politely chastised for not enough progress being made. That such a gentle man should be so strong and so capable of such achievement without the need to rely on tough words, bullying, unpleasant language or unkind behaviour speaks volumes for his decency, his skill and his dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was still giving me the benefit of his advice right up to his death. Only today I received a letter from him&mdash;the last he wrote to anyone&mdash;telling me that I must keep up the fight for proper and responsible behaviour by parliamentarians in their commercial ventures. He reminded me that I had to attend the Culburra senior citizens' Christmas dinner in December this year because I had missed it last year when I was our delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly place on record some of the contributions of Fred Evans to his nation and his community. Born in 1913 in North Sydney and educated at my old school, North Sydney Boys High School, Fred enlisted in the Citizens Military Force in February 1931 at the age of 18. He was commissioned a lieutenant in 1938. When World War II came he served in Malaya, unfortunately, and was a prisoner of war there for three years and eight months, during which time he saw probably the worst aspects of human behaviour. Yet that did not change and may even have enhanced the generous nature and the decency of spirit that Fred Evans demonstrated all his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war, he graduated to the Australian Staff College. He was a member of staff of Queen Elizabeth II during her first official visit to Australia in 1954 as an army liaison officer and assistant New South Wales state marshal. He then went to Korea as an Australian representative on the United Nations Military Armistice Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He retired from the permanent army, of which he had become a member straight after the war, in 1960. Prior to his retirement he had been heavily involved in many activities, such as the Boy Scouts parents' committee, organising and fund-raising, and junior football committees, in which he was heavily involved and, of course, a patron. He was appointed a justice of the peace in 1953. He assisted in the formation of local ex-servicemen's registered clubs and arranged and maintained assistance for the disadvantaged children's home at Campbelltown in New South Wales. Unfortunately, he suffered two coronary occlusions in 1972 and two more in 1976. Ill health forced his retirement from work in March 1973 and he was then classified as a totally and permanently disabled ex-serviceman. As a TPI pensioner he probably worked harder than most able-bodied people, but for good causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After his retirement to Culburra he intended to spend time gardening and fishing. He found that there was so much community involvement available to him that he did not get much fishing or gardening done. He became the foundation committee member of the Culburra Community Development Organisation, which was a body formed to deal with local government and development matters. He wrote its constitution and has always been its adviser, assistant secretary and principal spokesman and has prepared all of its major submissions for an enormous volume of activities, most of which seem to have come to fruition. He was awarded an MBE in the Queen's New Year Honours in 1979 for services to the aged and the community. He was awarded the RSL Anzac of the Year Award in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major events that took place in 1975 which turned his life into complete dedication to community work, in which he was still involved in a leading and advisory role at the time of his death, were the formation of the Culburra and Districts Community Health Service and the Culburra and Districts Senior Citizens Association. This senior citizens association was started by his wife, Avis, caring for older people, particularly those living in isolation, and having them socially at her home. Realising the urgent need for such an organisation, Avis and Fred arranged for the Culburra Community Development Organisation to call a public meeting for those interested and this association was inaugurated in July 1975 with 15 members. It quickly grew to in excess of 100 and now has a membership of 832. It has the largest such membership of any organisation of that kind on the south coast of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Evans became its foundation president, wrote its constitution, had it registered as a charitable organisation, arranged its exemption from sales tax and arranged for tax exemption for donors of $2 or more. This went on despite the fact that in 1982 he had open heart surgery for a six by-pass operation. A long convalescent period did not diminish his determination to proceed. He organised a whole series of guest speakers, monthly luncheons and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was extremely active in the procurement of and planning for the building of the Culburra Senior Citizens Centre, which is the largest of its kind on the south coast of New South Wales. I was overjoyed to be involved with him in that project. He convinced the local council and the architect of what was required to meet the needs of all senior citizens in the area. It was at his insistence that the Prime Minister officially opened the building, on the basis that no person of such high office had ever been to Culburra before. He arranged for local school children to line both sides of the main road to see their Prime Minister, no matter what the politics were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He guided the association with his capable, energetic leadership and broadened the interests of the association in a wide field by his involvement in Sydney in the New South Wales Council on the Ageing and the Senior Citizens Week Advisory Committee in the Premier's Department ever since its inception. He was Deputy Chairman of the Shoalhaven City Council's Senior Citizens Advisory Committee and played leading roles throughout the region in senior citizen activities. He was heavily involved in state-wide senior citizen activity as well. He was the coordinator for the annual contest by the New South Wales Council on the Ageing in its Senior Citizen of the Year activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the major thing which he was also involved in was the growth of the retirement village at Culburra, of which he was a resident when he died. This has now a 40-bed nursing home, 30-unit hostel and 30 self-care units, all emerging as a result of long, hard, continuous negotiation&mdash;writing, conferences and so on&mdash;for which Fred Evans was the driving force. He is a man who was highly regarded by everyone in Culburra. I extend my condolences to his widow, my dear friend Avis, who spent almost 60 years as half of a wonderful partnership, and also to his children, Wendy, Pam, Robert and Doug, his grandchildren and great grandchildren. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I was speaking during the debate on an MPI on the Civil Aviation Authority and the way in which the government had administered it. Since making that speech I have received a letter from a pilot holding an airline transport pilot's licence. The information therein illustrates the point I was making at the time. I will take a few moments of the Senate's time tonight to read most of the letter to the Senate. This pilot had chartered, on a private charter for seven days, a Navajo Chieftain from Seaview Aviation. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On return to Archerfield from the 7 days trip the aircraft was delivered to its agreed point of hire. A fax was received from Seaview requesting the aircraft to be flown back to Lord Howe Island as </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was urgently needed the next day on Saturday 12th March.</PARA>
<PARA>That is this year. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agreed to perform the delivery flight (gratis) and delivered it to Lord Howe Island on 12th March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Lord Howe Island I pointed out the door problem again and requested how I was to be returned to Archerfield and was advised I was to be passengered back on the 4.00 pm service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 3.00 pm I reported in as a passenger for the flight and was told that there was a problem . . . requested me to captain the flight to the mainland. I advised that I could not do that as I already had flown for the last 8 days, I was too tired and (although I did not tell him) I was not route checked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was advised that there was another pilot who was not experienced who could do the flight and "would I supervise him". I said that would be a better option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to departure I started querying the pilot on the weather forecast, and his flight plan and load. He had no weather forecast, and I observed him telephone the CAA briefing office and give them some verbal information. There was no written flight plan&mdash;the whole flight was performed on GPS and the information given to the CAA in advance as guestimates. The information even referred to a reporting point 100 DME Ballina. (Ballina has no DME).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I estimate that the aircraft was 200kg overloaded at departure Lord Howe Island. The pilot taxied onto the runway at LHI together with another aircraft and lined up together on the threshold markers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilot lifted the aircraft at least 20 kts prior to take-off safety speed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilot proceeded to lean both engines together in the climb.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crosswind at Ballina Airport was in my opinion beyond the aircraft's demonstrated limit and the pilot landed the aircraft with considerable flare instead of "driving it" onto the runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilot did not observe my requests in relation to the operation of the aircraft and I was powerless to enforce the position as I was not employed by Seaview Aviation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I discovered that my name was used on the flightplan as the captain of the aircraft for that flight. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a special return flight to Archerfield with the Chief Pilot I let him know of my displeasure about the situation and of the performance of the pilot I flew with. On the return flight&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, on the flight from Lord Howe Island to Ballina&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I made comments about the door light problem and was able to show him the compensating errors of a "door ajar warning light" being inoperative and a loose main door latch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion I find it impossible to believe that Navajo Chieftain Aircraft at the weights they are operated could legally operate into Lord Howe Island given its runway length.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a really striking letter. One is required by law to have a weather forecast and submit a flight plan before flying a hire, charter or regular public transport flight. It is not possible to fly solely with GPS as a navigation aid on those types of flights. GPS is highly developed and highly accurate but it is not allowed by the Civil Aviation Authority as a primary aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To report that one is 100 miles from Ballina DME means that one can fix one's position accurately by the use of distance measuring equipment installed at Ballina airport. And there is no DME at Ballina, so that was a falsehood. The fact that the aircraft was at least 200 kilograms overloaded is very dangerous. Light twin engine aircraft have very little margin of performance. If they lose an engine on take-off, in the climb or even on the cruise, they have great difficulty in maintaining their altitude. The position is made absolutely untenable by overloading the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People look at aircraft like DC3s and think they are old-fashioned and all the rest of it. But when a DC3 is loaded in accordance with its flight manual and the throttles are opened on take-off, that aeroplane will fly if it loses an engine. It will take off, it will climb, it will fly round the circuit and land back on with the critical engine inoperative, with the propeller unfeathered in fine pitch, with take off flap setting and the undercarriage down. It has that reserve of power&mdash;if loaded accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues in the Senate here always amuse me when they elect to charter around their respective states with a twin engine aircraft in the belief that it is safer. Light twins are safe if they have been properly maintained and they are flown by well-trained pilots. Sadly, a lot of the pilots in the charter field do not meet the standards of competence of a regular airline pilot who goes through a rigid training regime and is subjected to checking by check captains on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would always rather fly, on the rare occasions I charter aircraft, in a single engine aircraft because I know if anything goes wrong there is no option for the pilot: he does not have to think; he just has to land straight ahead and we all walk away from it. But, with a twin engine aircraft, all it means is the accident is displaced another 200 yards or half a mile further on from where it would have happened with a single engine aircraft&mdash;and probably in a great deal of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point in this letter is that the pilot leaned both engines on take-off. On take-off power setting there is a very rich mixture. When the climb is established, the initial leaning takes place and when the aircraft is on the cruise the mixture is leaned out even more. But both engines are never leaned simultaneously&mdash;a very bad technique&mdash;because if there is a problem in the fuel flow, one loses 100 per cent of the power. One always leans one engine at a time, and when that is safely and correctly accomplished, one leans the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft was lifted off 20 knots prior to the take-off safety speed. The operator's manual for the aircraft lays down a certain speed under which the aircraft should not be lifted off the runway and the climb attempted, because if an engine is lost in that phase, the airspeed must be high enough to ensure that the aerodynamic controls on the aircraft, particularly the rudder, the elevators and the ailerons, are operative. Below that speed the aircraft is uncontrollable and an accident will ensue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pilot's name was used on the flight plan as the captain of the aircraft. That is grossly dishonest, and it says a great deal about the standards under which that company operated. I come back to the point I made last week: where people fly for hire and reward, they must meet minimal safety standards. Passengers who walk into a terminal and pay for a ticket are entitled to know that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure the safe execution of their flight, that they are flying in an aeroplane that has been properly maintained, has been properly loaded within the flight manual limitations, and is flown by crew who are properly trained and checked in that aircraft and are operating responsibly in accordance with the operations manual of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority has not exercised that surveillance in the past. I hope that the lessons of the immediate past have caused a major review of its policies with respect to priority. It is also true that the go-</PARA>
<PARA>vernment, although it has been told by me and many other people in this parliament that this was going on, has also been negligent in discharging its authority with respect to supervising the CAA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The Australian Government is not in a position to confirm media reports that a number of Singaporean companies are selling arms and other military equipment to Myanmar. The Singapore Government's policy is to `neither confirm nor deny' reports on Singapore's international arms sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government's position on defence sales to Myanmar is well known. While there is no international embargo on defence sales to Myanmar, Australia has implemented its own ban on defence exports to Myanmar, and has urged countries known to supply arms to Myanmar to discontinue such exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In keeping with their policy of `constructive engagement' with Myanmar, the ASEAN countries, including Singapore, would like to integrate Myanmar into the region in ways acceptable to the broader international community. In parallel with our firm stance towards Myanmar, we have been encouraging the ASEAN countries to use the opportunities provided by greater engagement with Myanmar to send some clear messages about the need for reform in that country. My discussions at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) in Bangkok in July revealed general acceptance, including by the ASEAN countries, that progress would be achieved through dialogue and engagement by the international community, rather than through confrontation and isolation; that the idea of benchmarks provided a means of gauging movement in Myanmar; and that there should be a relationship between concessions to the State Law and order Restoration Council (SLORC) and progress in Myanmar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. I assume that the honourable senator is not using the term `constructive engagement' to describe Australian policy towards Myanmar. There has been no change in Australian policy towards that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Australia will continue to take appropriate opportunities to raise its concerns about the situation in Myanmar, and related issues such as arms sales, with the ASEAN countries, including Singapore. Our position on defence sales is clear; our message is to discourage such sales.</PARA>
