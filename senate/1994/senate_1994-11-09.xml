<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letters of 25 August 1994 and 22 September 1994 in which you refer to Determinations HIT 5/1994 and INS 23/1993 both made under paragraph 4(1) (dd) of the National Health Act 1953, and Determinations HIT 6/1994 and HIT 7/1994 made respectively under paragraph 4D(1)(a) and 4D(1)(b) of the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked for clarification on the issues of retrospectivity which all of these Determinations contain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice sought from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that, in the context of section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (the Act), liabilities were imposed on registered health benefit organisations in respect of things done before the making of the determinations and accordingly those provisions of the determinations imposing the liability would have no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the advice from the Attorney-General's Department has been forwarded to the Secretary of your Committee. I had sought particular advice on the application of section 48(2) of the Act to a situation where the parties that are affected by the retrospective determinations had adjusted their positions in various ways to allow for the retrospectivity so they are not incurring liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I accept that the retrospective provisions contained in the determinations have no effect and I am currently examining options for remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have since re-made the determinations so that health fund benefits are being paid in accordance with the legislative provisions that exist for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 189, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 25 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide for several apparently important discretions in rr. 1.05(2)(c), 1.06(2)(c) and 1.08(2). The Committee has, however, already raised with you the question of discretions in the principal Regulations and we will look at the present discretions in the context of your reply to our earlier letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present Regulations provide in clause 1 of Schedule 1B for an apparent subdelegation of legislative power to the Commissioner. As such, this appears to be invalid. The Committee noted the advice in the Explanatory Statement that the Schedule was taken from the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations and therefore does not represent a change in the law. Nevertheless, we would appreciate your advice on the validity of the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the provision is valid, there appears to be no provision for the written arrangements to be tabled in Parliament and to be subject to possible disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 25 August 1994 concerning the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rule No 189 of 1994 (`the Regulations').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that your Committee seeks my views on two points:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does clause 1 of Schedule 1B constitute an invalid sub-delegation of legislative power to the Commissioner?; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If clause 1 of the Schedule is valid, should the `arrangements' made by the Commissioner under that clause be subject to parliamentary scrutiny (by a tabling and possible disallowance procedure).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 1.08(1) of the Regulations prohibits regulated superannuation funds from using a pension conversion factor (called for the purposes of the regulations a `pension valuation factor' (PVF)) greater than the PVF that would apply under Schedule 1B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1B sets out a range of PVF's which apply according to the applicable indexation rate applied by funds (as determined in accordance with that Schedule). Clauses 5 to 8 of Schedule 1B provide methods of calculating an applicable PVF for funds which determine their indexation factors on wage indexation figures, the CPI or on a discretionary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 1 of Schedule 1B provides that for funds that have an indexation rate greater than 8 per cent (in accordance with cl 6 or 7 of Schedule 1B), the applicable PVF is to be `calculated in accordance with arrangements determined in writing by the Commissioner'. Funds that fall within this category are, in practice, extremely rare. For instance, the provisions identical to Clause 1 in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations 1987 (the OSS Regulations) were used on only about two or three occasions (and each time in relation to a particular fund). In this regard it is important to note that clause 1 of Schedule 1B does not, in a practical sense, represent a new regulation&mdash;the clause has existed for some time in Schedule 3 of the OSS Regulations in the exact form that it now appears in the SIS Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By empowering the Commissioner in determine, in certain instances, `arrangements' to calculate PVFs, it is clearly arguable that the Governor-General has delegated to the Commissioner the power to set `standards' in respect of regulated superannuation funds in certain (albeit limited) circumstances, which is a power of the kind conferred on the Governor-General by sec 31 (in conjunction with sec 353(a)) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (`SIS').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department considers that clause 1 of Schedule 1B is probably a sub-delegation of legislative power unsupported by the terms of the SIS act, and therefore invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to have amending regulations prepared as soon as possible for submission to the Governor-General to amend Schedule 1B so as to avoid the probable invalidity of the current Regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My advice about clause 1 makes a response to your second query unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of my undertaking to amend clause 1, and the fact that Schedule 1B is unrelated to the majority of the regulations in Statutory Rule No. 189, I seek confirmation that your Motion of 19 September to disallow the whole of Statutory Rule No. 189 will be withdrawn before 10 November.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the following Regulations, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 25 August 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Wool Tax (Administration) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 191</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Tobacco Charges Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 192</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 197</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This series of Regulations, among other things, provides for the use of evidentiary certificates. There are, however, substantial differences between such provisions in the amended Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations and in those provisions in the other amended principal Regulations. Those other provisions, and similar earlier provisions in the Fringe Benefits Tax Regulations, provide safeguards for the use of evidentiary certificates which are lacking in the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for the reasons for the lack of safeguards in these Regulations, which appears to breach the rights of those affected by the evidentiary certificates.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the recent correspondence from the Committee of 25 August 1994. I apologise for the delay in replying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislative Services Group of the Australian Taxation Office on 25 June 1992 requested the Attorney-General's Department to prepare regulations to give effect to the introduction of the BillPay and EFT payment systems. This required amendments to the Taxation Administration Regulations and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting instructions to the Attorney-General included requests for provisions to be made for evidentiary certificates in relation to liabilities other than tax, that is, child support. It was requested that the provisions should allow for the certificates to be sufficient evidence of the facts that the person named in the certificate is liable to pay an amount to the Commissioner and that the sum in the certificate is, at the date of the certificate, a debt due to the Commonwealth. However, the request also stated that where the issues could not be dealt within the Taxation Administration Regulations, the new Child Support Regulations be amended to mirror these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General responded by framing Regulations which are now included in the Child Support Regulations. You have stated that these Regulations lack appropriate safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the Child Support Regulations inserted by Statutory Rule No 197 of 1994 differ from other Regulations to which you refer. The principal differences are that a certificate issued under the Child Support Regulations does not have to state:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the basis of the liability (that is, a court order or administrative assessment for child support) or the particulars of that liability;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that notice of the liability has been served on the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme of the child support legislation is quite different from the other legislation to which you refer. The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 does not, of itself, create a liability. It merely provides for the registration of certain liabilities created under some other legislation (generally the Family Law Act 1975 or the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989). Once the liability has been registered, it becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be inappropriate for a certificate issued for the purposes of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to state that the liability has been correctly raised under another piece of legislation or for it to contain a statement as to the correctness of the liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As it stands, the regulation merely requires the certificate to state that the debt is payable by the person to the Registrar. This reflects the way in which the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 operates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to consider section 116 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. That section provides that the mere production of a document purporting to be a copy of the entry in the Child Support Register is conclusive evidence of certain matters. These matters include the fact that the liability is a registrable maintenance liability, that the liability is duly registered under the Act, that the particulars entered in the Register are those set out in the document and that all of those particulars are correct. A notice specifying the particulars entered in the Register is served on both parties when a liability is initially registered</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to point out that a certificate issued under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Regulations is evidence only of the facts stated in the certificate. It does not purport to be evidence of any other facts. There are other mechanisms provided by the Principal Act for disputing the registration of the liability or the particulars entered in the Register. Any dispute as to the correctness of the liability, whether raised under an administrative assessment or a court order, must be dealt with by the Court under the appropriate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this information has been of assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letters of 25 August 1994 and 22 September 1994 in which you refer to Determinations HIT 5/1994 and INS 23/1993 both made under paragraph 4(1) (dd) of the National Health Act 1953, and Determinations HIT 6/1994 and HIT 7/1994 made respectively under paragraph 4D(1)(a) and 4D(1)(b) of the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked for clarification on the issues of retrospectivity which all of these Determinations contain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice sought from the Attorney-General's Department confirms that, in the context of section 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (the Act), liabilities were imposed on registered health benefit organisations in respect of things done before the making of the determinations and accordingly those provisions of the determinations imposing the liability would have no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the advice from the Attorney-General's Department has been forwarded to the Secretary of your Committee. I had sought particular advice on the application of section 48(2) of the Act to a situation where the parties that are affected by the retrospective determinations had adjusted their positions in various ways to allow for the retrospectivity so they are not incurring liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I accept that the retrospective provisions contained in the determinations have no effect and I am currently examining options for remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have since re-made the determinations so that health fund benefits are being paid in accordance with the legislative provisions that exist for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PIPELINE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make a number of technical amendments to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 and the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The first of these amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. The second category of amendments will facilitate the transfer of certain easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI. The Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements for ICI to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland and to Botany in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, at the time when the Moomba-Sydney pipeline was sold in June of this year, it was generally agreed that this was the most complex privatisation project undertaken by the government to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only were the parties involved required to meet a very tight time frame, but the sale itself involved the transfer of all pipeline assets to the new owners but with the Commonwealth retaining a joint ownership interest in the easements in which the pipeline runs. Further, the sale legislation had to take account of the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project which at that stage was still being developed between the Pipeline Authority and ICI. The task was not an easy one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the pipeline sale was completed on target and was able to also accommodate the future requirements of the ethane project attests to the determination and professionalism of all parties involved. The fact that the need for some technical amendments to the sale act has become necessary is, in the circumstances, not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments I am introducing today are essentially in two categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first address some concerns which were raised by the NSW government after the passage of the sale act with regard to its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. It was put to the Commonwealth that the legislation, as it stood, may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was never the government's intention that state licensing laws should not apply to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline after its sale to East Australia Pipeline Ltd or indeed, to any other private sector pipelines operating in these easements. Advice received from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General indicated that the problem, as perceived by NSW did not, in his view, in fact arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the NSW Solicitor-General took a somewhat different view on this issue, the government agreed to introduce an amendment in this session to put this matter beyond doubt. Accordingly, I am now proposing the required amendments that will clarify and acknowledge the application of state pipeline licensing laws in the relevant circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted, Mr President, that these changes will not affect the conditions under which the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline is being constructed by the Pipeline Authority for ICI. The authority is undertaking the construction process utilising immunities from state laws available to it under its own act. Once the authority withdraws from this project, however, these immunities will cease and ICI will become subject to those state licensing laws which these amendments are designed to uphold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second group of amendments relate specifically to this Moomba to Botany pipeline project that will bring ethane for use as a feed stock to ICI's plastics manufacturing plant. In September, after considerable negotiation, ICI was able to finally secure sufficient quantities of ethane from the Cooper Basin producers for this important project to proceed. At the same time the South Australia government approved the sale of these ethane reserves by the Cooper Basin gas producers to ICI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in turn cleared the way for pipeline construction contracts to be let. The Pipeline Authority will initially be responsible for building this pipeline and it is also obtaining those additional easements that will be required specifically for the ethane pipeline. As part of the agreed basis for this project, ownership of those easements being specifically obtained for the ethane pipeline by the Pipeline Authority are to be transferred to ICI once they have been secured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate that the responsibilities and obligations of owning these ethane-specific easements should ultimately rest with the organisation that will own the pipeline itself. This is particularly so in this instance where ICI is meeting all the costs associated with obtaining these new easements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of specific provisions in the bill by which to effect the transfer of ethane pipeline easements has a particular purpose. It reflects the Commonwealth's undertaking to facilitate, to the extent possible, the subsequent registration by ICI of its ownership of these easements with state titles offices. Whether or not this will ultimately occur is a matter for the states to determine. The Commonwealth cannot give any undertaking to ICI on this matter of registration but has sought to enhance the prospect of this occurring by including specific transfer provisions in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, whilst these amendments are technical in nature, they are nonetheless small but important steps in the overall context of the government's gas reform agenda. They will enable the Commonwealth to continue the process of disengagement from its involvement in the construction and operation of gas pipelines, allowing it to focus its attention on the creation of a pro-competitive market environment in the gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline to the private sector and the private ownership of the ethane pipeline project illustrate the confidence that business has in the future of Australia's gas industry. The most important role that government can play is to ensure the potential that exists in this sector is realised and that the benefits of reform accrue to all gas users and ultimately to the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (PREVENTION OF PROLIFERATION) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 will assist the Government in ensuring that Australia is fulfilling its treaty obligations and its citizens do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in any part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the Government. International recognition of the horrific results of the use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems) and concerns over the destabilising impact of the proliferation of such weapons have resulted in several major achievements in addressing this problem. Of greatest importance are the multilateral treaties either banning or restricting the proliferation of such weapons, principally the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention (which is not yet in force).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these global treaties, and reinforcing their objectives, are other measures which have been taken to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In concert with other similarly-minded countries, the Australian Government has maintained a range of export controls aimed at preventing the transfer, directly or indirectly, of goods and technology, which could be used in the development of WMD, to programs known to be or suspected of posing a WMD proliferation risk. These controls were developed by international export control regimes of which Australia is a member&mdash;the Nuclear Suppliers' Group and the Zangger Committee (nuclear), the Australia Group (chemical and biological) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (missile delivery systems).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's export controls on goods (including technology in a tangible form) are covered by the Customs Act 1901 through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Exports of dualuse materials and technology (equipment and technology which have both commercial and military uses) are controlled under a series of these Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to identify and describe (for regulatory purposes) all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the Customs Regulations: once in Regulations, all exports of these items would require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the Government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could for example take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program; financial assistance; brokering the supply of materials; or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the Customs Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the "catch-all" or "safety-net" provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation, for example the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways: it puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the Government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. While there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the Government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation. Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the Government informed them of its concerns. We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs. Hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the Government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows or suspects of the connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a Ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program, but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the Government on the risk (or not) of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The Customs Regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the Government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment, not as briefly as I sometimes would, on the Legislative Instruments Bill. The coalition supports the second reading of this bill but believes that the consideration in detail should await further review of this bill by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I know that it has already been to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinance, but there was an agreement that it would also go to the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be a waste of the Senate's time to go through and deal with various amendments suggested by, or that come up as a consequence of, our own committee, only to have the bill go down to the lower house and probably have another bout of amendments. If we were really being sensible and efficient, as we claim Public Service departments ought to be when they come before us in estimates, we would say, `Look, why don't we let everybody have their say on this and then we will deal with it in the respective chambers.' I am pleased to say that the attorney has agreed to that path; so today, as I understand it, by agreement we will proceed with the second reading of the bill but no further. It will then be considered by the house committee and will come back here and we will do our committee stage. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion, add: ``, and that the consideration of the bill in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for 5 December 1994''.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that will fix up the problem. As I said in the beginning, the coalition supports the principle and aims of the bill, but I want to touch on a couple of areas of concern already highlighted and the government's proposed response. I will first just briefly deal with the background to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the procedures for making, drafting, publication and parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation, of which I understand at least 115 varieties have been identified, are disparate and inadequate. Adequate procedures are required to ensure accountability in the rule making process and to ensure those affected by rules are given the chance to participate in the process. Defects were identified in the March 1992 report of the Administrative Review Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS>, and it is that report that really is the impetus for this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements some but not all of the recommendations in that report. Over the last 20 years or so, controls on the exercise of power delegated to the executive and the bureaucracy have mainly involved discretionary power, administrative review, freedom of information, the ombudsman's review and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and largely operate to control administrative decisions affecting individuals. Delegated legislative power has been left, I might say for the Senate regulations and ordinances committee, largely untouched. The bill defines the term `legislative instrument' for the purposes of the act. It establishes a federal register on which legislative instruments must be recorded. It sets up consultation procedures that must be undertaken in relation to legislative instruments affecting business. The procedures require that a form of regulatory impact assessment be prepared in relation to such instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed instruments must be advertised and comments sought from interested parties. It also provides for parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments and re-enacts with some provisions of Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 relating to delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pause from reading the prepared notes to highlight the importance of this bill. We come in here, we spend time talking about the legislation, we have long and sometimes properly considered debates and extensive committee stage discussions, and things get sent off to standing committees of the Senate to be looked at. An enormous amount of delegated legislation is looked at by the Senate regulations and ordinances committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations and ordinances committee has a fabulous reputation. I had the privilege of serving on that committee for a limited period of time. It has a completely unblemished record in the sense that it has never lost when it has recommended that something be disallowed. But no-one should underestimate the impact on people's daily lives of that very vast range and volume of delegated legislation. It is just enormous. It is, therefore, an enormous task that we give to the Senate regulations and ordinances committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, I think, is going the other way in the sense of trying to improve delegated legislation. The regulations and ordinances committee can recommend to disallow. This legislation is trying to fix up the process before we get to that point&mdash;to make some contribution in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have the figures to indicate&mdash;and I am not sure that anyone really could put them together&mdash;just how vast the impact of delegated legislation is on the daily lives of Australians. In that sense, this bill is much more important and will make a much more significant contribution to the legislative process than many others that we see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle behind the legislation is worthwhile and fully supported by us. The impact of the bill on the Commonwealth public sector will be significant in terms of time and resources. That will be particularly the case in relation to the consultation requirements for rules affecting business and the requirement that a regulatory impact assessment be prepared for such rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the experience in other states, particularly in Victoria where consultation procedures have been in place since 1985, that the bureaucracy will embrace these procedures somewhat reluctantly. They will need to be monitored and pushed, and probably shoved at every turn. It is crucial that the bill be designed to encourage compliance with its provisions and it is also crucial that parliament, which is given the principal role for the enforcement of the procedures, provide appropriate mechanisms to facilitate that proper scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns relating to that issue as well as other matters have been raised and considered by the regulations and ordinances committee. The regulations and ordinances committee dealt in a specific and fairly thorough way with a number of concerns of those who made submissions to and appeared before the committee. It made a number of very sensible recommendations, most of which have been accepted by the government. At this point I do not want to comment exhaustively on those recommendations or the governments response; there are just a few more things I would like to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only real avenue provided in the bill for review of the procedure is parliament through the use of the disallowance procedure. The practical success of that avenue will depend entirely on the operation of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the extent to which parliament continues to accede to its recommendations as it has always done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether, because of this bill and the need to monitor its implementation, the committee will have to look at revamping its procedures in some way&mdash;its terms of reference, its staffing, the manner in which it goes about its work. It may be able to take on that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we can just pass the bill and assume that everything will be okay. Somebody has to be watching that the bill, when passed, which will make everybody feel happy that the processes have been improved, is actually being properly complied with. Otherwise, it will be just a piece of window dressing under which a number of legislative instruments would go through the proper consultation process each year and others would escape. So somebody has to be the watchdog in that respect. We need to ensure that the watchdog in that sense has the proper resources and capacity to do the job. I hope that matter is given further consideration while this bill is being considered by the House of Representatives committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the bill absolutely and positively prohibits judicial and administrative review of a number of crucial determinations as to whether the procedures contained in the bill apply. This bill is not going to apply to every legislative instrument. In addition, failure to comply with certain crucial procedures&mdash;that is, consultation for example&mdash;does not in the end affect the validity of the rules. That highlights why there has to be a proper mechanism agreed upon to ensure that the bill is properly applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to say that this is a legislative instrument which should have gone through this course of consultation and then we say, `It didn't go through that course of consultation but don't worry; it doesn't matter; the rules are still valid,' it raises the question of why we bothered to say that it should have gone through the consultation process in the first place. There has to be some type of muscle standing behind the requirement that the consultation process take place otherwise, on difficult matters which are likely to have an adverse reception in the community, the consultation will not take place. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of judicial and administrative review of the procedures, I want to comment on a specific matter that was the subject of comment: to have a recommendation by the regulations and ordinance committee. It concerns clause 7 of the bill which, as presently drafted, gives the Attorney-General conclusive and unreviewable power to determine, at the request of a rule maker, whether a legislative instrument is covered by this bill. The determination is specifically excluded from both judicial review and administrative review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General has argued that such a determination is not suited to review. After expressing considerable reservation about that power, the regulations and ordinances committee was satisfied with the proposed amendments of the government that would make a determination that an instrument was not covered, subject to disallowance by the parliament. Fortunately, I will have more time to reflect on whether that is the best way to deal with that problem. Time will be granted because, as we know, this legislation is going to the House committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An associated question that does not appear to have been raised in detail is the situation where the rule maker determines unilaterally, without reference to the Attorney-General, that the instrument is not covered by the bill. There is no specific mention of judicial or administrative review of that determination. If that means review is permitted, it would appear inconsistent with the policy that no review is possible when a certificate is issued. That matter needs to be cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment also on the failure of the bill to implement the recommendation of the Administrative Review Council that legislative instruments be sunsetted. Some may say that the backdown in that respect is a cop-out. The ARC's recommendation was endorsed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearer Commonwealth law</EMPHASIS>. The government, however, has indicated that the practice of sunsetting has not been used because an evaluation of the benefits has not been undertaken and it would be premature, therefore, to enact the practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that we have got that right. I would like to write a book one day on the 10 great fallacies. I am sure that the first would be: every man is presumed to know the law. It is the biggest load of rubbish I have ever heard in my life. Every parliament has to make a contribution to simplifying the law, making sure it does not sit there as a dead letter arrangement, out of touch and out of date, and perhaps not even used, cluttering up the statute books and making legal advice far more expensive because any sensible solicitor checks every rule that can possibly be checked to make sure that the advice given is the right advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way we could do that is by setting ourselves targets, by sunsetting things, by forcing ourselves to have another look at what we have done and considering whether it is still appropriate. It is not a matter of simply passing a bill today and, no pun intended, sailing off into the sunset and not worrying about how it will affect people in the future. That is not to say that I think we should now automatically say, `Yes, let's sunset it.' I am simply raising the point that we have to get to the bottom of how this massive Commonwealth legislation and delegated legislation&mdash;these legislative instruments&mdash;can possibly be kept up to date so that everyone has at least a tenth of a chance of knowing what the law is in areas where they want to know what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter in relation to the ARC report is the extent of the consultation requirements. These procedures apply only to specified rules affecting business, and that significantly backs away from the ARC recommendation that procedures apply to all legislative instruments. It eliminates from the requirements many of the types of legislative instrument that should be subject to consultation procedures. One example may well be welfare entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there is some considerable validity to the government's argument that procedures should be tested first on a specified class of instrument before it is expanded to cover other areas. I simply flag that those of us who are interested in these issues should, after a period of time, be looking to see how the consultation process has gone on with the specified class of instruments, the business ones, and then expand on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that is perfectly simple, and I stated it at the very beginning: the range and volume of these instruments dramatically affect the lives of Australians. Those who consider only bills in this chamber and have not had the opportunity to work on the regulations and ordinances committee, for example, would probably not have a clue about how extensive these legislative instruments are and how they affect the daily lives of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, as presently drafted, the bill would allow disallowance of the whole of a legislative instrument, significantly restricting the flexibility of the Senate to disallow part of a legislative instrument. I congratulate the government for having had the good sense to agree to move amendments to increase the flexibility which, some would say, is already there but which is often not exercised because of some doubt about whether the Senate has the power. I look forward to the committee stage of this bill, when we will have the benefit of the work done by the House of Representative Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. Overall, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill. Its main purpose is to provide easy and inexpensive access to delegated legislation through the creation of an electronic register of legislative instruments and to create a more streamlined process for classifying and subjecting them to parliamentary scrutiny. I think it is important to note that we are dealing with a substantive body of law that comes into being through this particular process and that this bill is therefore a very important one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government has published its intention to refer the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As a result of that, the Senate will be proceeding to the second reading stage only. I welcome that move. I believe it is important that this bill be subjected to searching inquiry. While we have had the benefit of a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances&mdash;and it is indeed a very good committee&mdash;that committee has not addressed all the issues substantively that need to be addressed. I look forward to the report of the House of Representatives committee, which will have the benefit of this debate in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as it currently stands is a response to a comprehensive report by the Administrative Review Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth agencies</EMPHASIS>. After enactment of the bill, members of the public will be able to scan the register and print out a copy of any delegated legislation or regulation. This is a major improvement over the existing situation where poorly organised records of delegated legislation are inaccessible to all but a small proportion of the population. As such, it should move us a little closer to the desirable reality of access to the legal system for all Australian citizens. All new legislative instruments will be placed on the register and, over time, all existing instruments will also be included. Instruments that are not properly registered will not be enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the creation of this instrument register, the bill provides a new regulatory framework for delegated legislation. Part of this framework includes the definition of what constitutes a legislative instrument, a prescription for limited community consultation&mdash;I might say even now it is far too limited&mdash;and mechanisms for parliamentary scrutiny. The principles behind this bill&mdash;namely, accessibility, predicability and, to a certain extent, openness&mdash;are to be applauded. They comprise a vital element of the process of improving access to justice and go some way in achieving a greater transparency in the legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether the bill goes far enough in its present draft. The answer must be no. The Australian Democrats have a range of significant objections and proposals for amendments. The first of our concerns relates to the power of the Attorney-General under clause 7 to conclusively certify whether or not an instrument is legislative. I welcome the suggestion made by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances that certificates issued by the attorney should be expressly deemed to be disallowable instruments. I understand that the government has agreed in substance to that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this proposal does not address the fundamental concern that the bill confers quasi-judicial powers upon the Attorney-General and goes further to exempt his decisions from the ADJR Act. This may be in breach of chapter 3 of the constitution that exclusively vests the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the High Court and Federal Court of Australia. It would certainly appear to contravene the principle that the parliament should make law and the courts should determine disputes according to the law. In my view, the bill would be greatly improved if clause 7 were to be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the Democrats' concerns relates to the absence of sunsetting provisions, despite the fact that the Administrative Review Council specifically recommended sunsetting in its report. Presumably, the government has ignored this section on the basis of the cost of the practice. However, this aspect of the bill is also entirely at odds with the recommendations of the action plan of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee&mdash;the so-called Sackville report. It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should, in accordance with the recommendations made by the Administrative Review Council, introduce a scheme for the sunsetting of all delegated legislation on a ten year rotating basis to ensure that delegated legislation is of a high quality, and up to date if it is required at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The government should spare us the fanfare that accompanies the release of such reports if it has absolutely no intention of implementing its recommendations. Even the Business Council of Australia was scathing of the government's bill in this regard. In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the business council is generally supportive of the broad thrust of the Legislative Instruments Bill, it is extremely disappointed to note that the proposed legislation is considerably weaker than similar state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, the Commonwealth is failing to meet higher standards set in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia which have all introduced legislation for general sunsetting of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>The question we might ask is this: is the government satisfied with introducing half-baked legislation that is regarded as inferior to that of its state counterparts?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes even the states may have a thought or a law that should be preferred as a model for Commonwealth legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I wish to make about the Legislative Instruments Bill is that the consultation provisions are inadequate. The bill sets out the circumstances in which consultation is not required. The first of these provides that consultation is not required in the event that the instrument implements an obligation of the Commonwealth under an international agreement. The Australian Democrats believe that the Australian community would benefit from improved consultation during the creation of international agreements, and the private member's bill introduced by Senator Bourne bears this out. For this reason we cannot accept the specific exclusion of this matter in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, consultation is also not required where the instrument gives effect to a decision announced in the budget. I would be keen to hear the government's explanation for this. In our view, this is only warranted if the budget announcement were preceded by adequate consultation. Certainly, there are other clauses in this area which cover this particular situation and which are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third exclusion&mdash;and this would appear to be the broadest in scope&mdash;is that the government has decided not to consult in relation to matters that do not directly affect business. Certainly, we understand the significant use that the business community makes of delegated legislation, but it is difficult to see the justification for this provision excluding all other sectors. In particular, we cannot agree with the implication that regulations that affect business are in some way more significant than those that impact upon other rights&mdash;for instance, welfare regulations and regulations that concern migration, social security, education, family law, defence and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Ms Jane Goddard from the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre stated in her submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current proposal to limit the consultation provisions to areas affecting business is contrary to the Government's stated commitment to make justice within Australia more accessible. It also implies that business interests are in some way more important than other interests.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, while we fully appreciate the important role that delegated legislation has for the business community, it is difficult to accept that the other sectors are somehow second best and not deserving of consultation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refusal to consult on non-business regulations also passes up, in our view, a critical opportunity to improve the standard of subordinate legislation. The director of the Australian Council of Social Service, Ms Betty Hounslow, gave a good example of this in her submission when she explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consultation improves the quality of the final product . . . For example, the (then) Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations consulted peak advocacy bodies in relation to the 1989 Migration Regulations. This consultation contributed enormously to the quality of the regulations, leading to re-writes of essential textual material that would otherwise have required immediate amendment, as well as to policy changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Business Council of Australia was also critical of this feature of the bill, arguing that it does not provide for public hearings into controversial or sensitive legislative proposals, as recommended in the ARC report. The point here is that by avoiding legislative rewrites and producing more efficient legislation, consultation can actually save money. I believe that the government's pre-occupation with costs ignores this fundamental point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another of our concerns. Clause 48(4) provides for a new provision under which a house may defer consideration of a motion of disallowance for up to six months. Although this would appear to extend the degree to which parliament may control legislative instruments, it has been argued that it may serve to limit parliament's ability to actually effect disallowance. The reality is that in some circumstances a delay will help parliament to make better decisions, while, in others, it may weaken parliament's resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we do not oppose this provision, we believe it should be complemented by allowing parliament to defer the effect of a disallowance motion for up to six months&mdash;in other words, to pass a disallowance motion but to defer its effect. This would make it clear that the instrument in question would cease to operate, while allowing time for alternative regulatory arrangements to be put in place. It would allow a disallowance motion to be dealt with without creating a regulatory vacuum. It is worth noting that this is what the ARC proposed in its report, and the bill has departed from the council's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further point in this area that I should make. The Democrats contend that it ought to be possible to disallow part of an individually numbered regulation&mdash;in other words, a subclause or a subsection; disallowance should not be limited to full sections of a regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill and applaud the work of the Administrative Review Council that gave rise to it. The bill will certainly improve the accountability of makers of delegated legislation, lead&mdash;we hope&mdash;to a more accessible body of rules and provide a more coordinated framework in which this substantial body of law is administered. The importance of this legislation underlines the need for us all to make sure that we have the best possible regime in place. To this end, I look forward to the report of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. As I have said before, I welcome the decision to defer the committee stage of the bill in the Senate until that report is available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 is a very important piece of legislation. I concur with the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone. I also very largely concur with the comments Senator Spindler made on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The very name of the bill indicates that this piece of legislation is somewhat dry and boring in nature. Put simply, this bill deals with process and, as such, it is vitally important that the government and the parliament get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was first introduced into the Senate more than four months ago. On 25 August 1994, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I am pleased to say that the committee, on which I have the honour of serving, came down with a unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, this report once again shows the strength of the Senate committee system and the fact that a lot of issues facing this house are dealt with on a non-partisan basis by all parties with one concern at heart&mdash;that is, to get it right for the benefit of those whom we serve in this chamber, the Australian people. It is something that the media and other people often do not realise, so I take the opportunity on a broadcast day to remind the Australian people that their parliament does work effectively. People from all parties can get together on committees and come down with unanimous reports indicating their views on the best way of drafting legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exercise that we have been through with the Legislative Instruments Bill also highlights the very important role of the Senate as a house of review, with its committee system and structure, in allowing us to try to get things right. It is noteworthy that this bill, which was introduced by the government, now faces 81 amendments as a result of further consideration being given to it. I believe that this bill, with all the proposed government amendments, will be of benefit to the people of Australia who, unfortunately, have their lives controlled by a plethora of regulations and ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A top performing former Tasmanian Liberal senator, Sir Reginald Wright, had a proud history of checking regulations and ordinances and protecting individuals, the citizenry of Australia, against the heavy-handed approach of executive government and bureaucracy. I believe that all senators would do well to keep in mind that proud record of Sir Reginald Wright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has had an ever increasing number of instruments to scrutinise. The people of Australia may like to reflect on the following statistics. In 1992 the committee, on which I now serve, checked 1,562 instruments; in 1993, 1652 instruments; and in 1994, 1,804 instruments. In very rough terms that is about five or six new instruments per day or a new instrument every five hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat frightening when one considers that these regulations and ordinances impact on the daily lives of people in all spheres. When my colleague Senator O'Chee and I&mdash;and also Senator Colston, who is present for this debate and who is the chair of the committee&mdash;look at all these instruments, we realise the impact that they have on individuals in all walks of life. They might relate to the Family Law Act, meat exports, civil aviation&mdash;the list goes on. One can be assured that regulations and ordinances, or legislative instruments, are made virtually in respect of every sphere of life and have a very real impact. Usually they are not even commented upon in this parliament and often come into force without much public consideration or comment. Therefore, the role of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is important and this new bill is very important in itself as it will introduce a new regime on legislative instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the growth rate that I have just indicated&mdash;1,804 new instruments last year&mdash;it is vital that appropriate safeguards be implemented and a regime introduced to provide adequate protection to the people of Australia, to businesses, to welfare groups or whoever may be affected by legislative instruments. As previous speakers have indicated, the bill has its genesis in the Administrative Review Council report to the Attorney-General entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rule making by Commonwealth Agencies</EMPHASIS>, delivered to the then Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, on 26 March 1992. Here we are some 2 1/2 years later debating a bill which gives at least some effect to the report produced by the Administrative Review Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances considered the bill and has supported it, with significant amendments proposed by the committee as a result of its own deliberations, but also as a result of public hearings very good and worthwhile input was contributed by members of the public as well as by people who deal with legislative instruments every day of their lives. That was of great benefit to the final product which will come before the parliament, which hopefully will pass it. I also note that it is quite possible further amendments will be forthcoming as a result of the review that is being undertaken by a committee in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern with the bill is with clause 7, which would have given the Attorney-General, or indeed the executive arm of the government, the final say in determining into which category an instrument might fall. The Attorney-General had the power to determine conclusively whether an instrument is a legislative instrument without any possibility of judicial review. I found that highly objectionable. Indeed, on reflection, it is of great concern to me that such a proposal was allowed to be put forward because it does not give voice to the principle that I believe we should hold dear, namely, the separation of powers between the executive government and the judiciary. Basically the Attorney would have been making the decision and then avoiding any judicial review of that decision. I believe that would not have been in the best interests of the people of Australia, and certainly not in the interests of a separation of powers with all the safeguards that that provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that the government has quite appropriately agreed to will now require the Attorney-General to provide a certificate which, in itself, as I understand the amendments, will then be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That is just one of the 81 amendments to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is generally supported by the opposition. Although it is not a piece of legislation where we will see public meetings, petitions or headlines in our media&mdash;indeed, I dare say the people in the public gallery are not exactly riveted to their seats, given the debate that we are having on this Legislative Instruments Bill&mdash;it is a very important piece of legislation because it deals with the very regulations and ordinances affecting all of our lives and it will have impact for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend and colleague Senator Abetz has quite rightly pointed out that there are over 1,800 items of delegated legislation which are dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances every year. Whilst some of these items of delegated legislation may seem inconsequential and, in fact, trivial&mdash;for example, I believe last year we had an instrument which set out the definition of a shearer&mdash;some of the instruments that come before the committee are very important ones because they relate, for example, to a person's right to conduct business, to regulations in the Public Service, and to people's superannuation entitlements; and these are all very important matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, therefore, when a bill such as the Legislative Instruments Bill comes before the parliament that it is given proper scrutiny. Certainly, when the bill was originally presented I had grave reservations about the provisions that were contained in it. I am very proud to say that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, chaired very ably by Senator Colston, who is across the aisle, has done an excellent job in presenting its report, a report which, I am very pleased to say also, was a unanimous report. Members of the committee will know my concerns in this regard because the recommendations of this committee have never been deviated from, at least in so far as items of delegated legislation themselves have been concerned, and I was very keen to ensure that the work of the committee could not be characterised as a partisan work on either side of the chamber and that, if possible, we could get a unanimous report; and that is what we got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the crucial areas, and one of the areas that the committee spent longest deliberating on, was the proposed clause 7. As Senator Abetz has said, proposed clause 7 would have enabled the Attorney-General to issue a conclusive certificate in respect of future items of delegated legislation to totally exempt them as legislative instruments, which would have had the effect of eliminating the necessity for those instruments to be put on the register and, in certain circumstances, would also have limited the power of the parliament to disallow those instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusive certificate power which was proposed in the original clause 7(2) was not a power that related just to individual items of delegated legislation; it related to whole classes which were yet to be made. Of course, no decent committee of this Senate can allow a situation like that to arise. No decent committee of this Senate can say, `We are just going to allow the Attorney-General to exempt a category of instrument from the purview of the Senate or of the House of Representatives.' That is why the committee recommended, as it did, that conclusive certificates issued under clause 7(2) be disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of that was very simple. First of all, the committee had concerns that the Attorney-General should not have a quasi-judicial function. That is certainly what clause 7, as originally proposed, would have given the Attorney-General. Moreover, the committee was concerned that there be some mechanism, while still fitting into the general scheme of the bill, which would allow those items to be reviewed so that the Attorney-General could not just sign off with no review and no appeal process. I believe the recommendation we brought down in relation to clause 7(2) is a very good recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the committee not decide to make the same recommendation in relation to clause 7(1), which concerns the power of the Attorney-General to make a conclusive certificate in relation to an instrument made before the commencement of the bill but which was not added to the register? This is really very much a matter of rectifying mistakes made by the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those regulations which are made before the commencement of this bill, and which have been validly made under the Acts Interpretation Act, are valid now. Their omission from the register could make them unenforceable. The provision contained in clause 7(1) created a mechanism by which that could be circumvented. It would seem unreasonable for the committee to say, `Look, we are going to knock that out entirely,' given that these instruments are already of force and effect and given that people are deemed to know that these instruments have come into force. Certainly an affected person, I would assume, does know in most circumstances that these instruments have come into force because many of them have been in force for a long period of time. It seems unreasonable for an affected person to then be able to plead that because the instrument of which they may well have had knowledge was not included in the register it should be unenforceable against them. That is the basis on which the committee decided to exclude conclusive certificates issued under clause 7(1) from being disallowable instruments as proposed for clause 7(2) conclusive certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that most of the recommendations of the committee have been accepted by the government, but there are a number which should not be accepted by the government. There are two in particular to which I wish to turn my attention. The first of those recommendations relates to regulations in relation to the Australian National University and the content of courses. I agree with the committee's report that those items should probably best be excluded from the operation of the bill. That sounds a rather strange suggestion that it would actually reduce, so it would seem, the opportunity for examination of these matters, but these are matters in relation to the subject matter of university courses at the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems rather strange that the ANU should be in a situation where its course material should be subject to the scrutiny of both the House of Representatives and the Senate when, of course, that is not the case in other universities. It just seems to me that it also creates the opportunity at some future date for somebody in just one house of this parliament, not both, to exercise an ability to effectively censor course material at the ANU. If that power to control the course material required an act of Parliament and passed both houses, that would be one matter. But the fact is that course material at the ANU could be disallowed by either house creates the opportunity for rather arbitrary interference with intellectual and academic freedom. That is why I support the recommendation made by the committee. I believe that the government really should turn its attention to that matter again, and I believe this chamber would do well to accept the recommendation of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other recommendation that the government did not accept is one I also believe the government ought to accept if it is interested in ensuring that people have an opportunity to know the law as it affects them. The recommendation that the committee made on page 7 was that other material which was produced by the office of the principal Legislative Council should be available in printed form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had said, `Look, that is not necessary, because when one goes to court the court is happy to accept a print-out.' But the whole purpose of allowing people access to the law is so that they can govern their conduct so that they do end up in court. That is why I believe the Attorney-General has erred in not accepting the recommendation. Because if people cannot get access to the law, it then makes the law seem very arbitrary and very unfair. If people have access to the law and relevant documents in relation to those laws, then at least they have an opportunity to acquaint themselves with their obligations under the law. That is why I believe that recommendation should be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter that was raised in the committee's report and which was not alluded to in the Attorney-General's response. That was the suggestion that when this bill is reviewed in three years time the review should also consider the power of the committee to deal with subordinate legislation when the Senate is not sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware that over the recent winter recess the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was given a power in relation to the Industrial Relations Court rules, to release those rules from the ambit of a protective notice of motion so as to allow them to be re-made. But that was an unprecedented power and a power which the committee decided not to exercise in the particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe it is appropriate for the Senate and the parliament to consider a wider power to be given to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and that would be a power to suspend a regulation when the Senate is not sitting. A suspension would not be the same as a disallowance of the instrument, because disallowance of the instrument would therefore make it impossible for that instrument to be re-made within a period of six months. But there are certain circumstances when a legislative instrument could severely restrict the rights of individuals and where to delay dealing with that matter would be a gross contravention of people's civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I think it is appropriate that the committee should have a power to suspend the operation of that particular item of delegated legislation until such time as the parliament comes back and the matter can be properly dealt with. Whilst the committee did not find it appropriate to recommend that that be added to the bill at this time, the committee was certainly of the view that it should be part of the review in three years time, and I hope that the Attorney-General can give an assurance to this chamber and to the parliament that that will take place. The increasing volume of delegated legislation does give rise to an increasing opportunity to restrict a person's liberties and freedoms unduly. It would be a dreadful thing if a situation were to arise where, if the Senate standing committee had the power to suspend that particular item of delegated legislation, an individual's or a group of individuals' rights would be trammelled in the way in which it is capable of being trammelled at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by other speakers on this side of the chamber, this bill has the general support of the opposition. I believe that the second reading amendment moved by my colleague Senator Vanstone does have merit. It has been done before in this chamber, and would be an effective way of dealing with the concerns that we on this side have over the committee stage of the bill. I understand that that matter has been the subject of some negotiation between Senator Faulkner and Senator Vanstone. I have just received a thumbs up from Senator Cook, which must be a first, definitely. I assume that means that the matter has been adequately and satisfactory dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the work of the committee has substantially improved the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) makes certain amendments to the Migration Act 1958 retrospective to 1 November 1989&mdash;five years ago&mdash;in an attempt to ensure that certain provisions of the act are consistent with what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and his department claim are their previously understood effect. This bill is identical to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;which is, I think, languishing on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;except for a new provision which repeals section 54RA of the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a retrospective attempt to deal with an issue that has plagued successive immigration ministers in this government. However, it is an issue entirely of the government's own making, and stress that. The opposition recognises the government's dilemma and to this point has done much to help the government attempt to resolve the problem, as I hope the minister will acknowledge. However, the opposition is now of the view that, on balance, this bill is an unacceptable method of tackling the problem. Therefore, we will be voting against the bill in its entirety, and that includes the new section to repeal section 54RA of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going into detail, I will list the main reasons for our rejection of the bill. The bill is designed to make lawful what is now unlawful. It attempts to change the law so that the unlawful action of depriving boat people of their liberty between November 1989 and May 1992 is now deemed to have been lawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of the section that repeals section 54RA, this bill is totally retrospective. It applies only to boat people unlawfully detained between November 1989 and 6 May 1992. It has no application to any future unauthorised arrivals; their detention is lawful as a result of the Migration Reform Act, which came into effect on 1 September 1994. The coalition fully supports the detention provisions in that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also breaches several basic principles of law. It condones the proposition that, wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken, the parliament may retrospectively act to cure it. If we accept that proposition, that would, as the Law Council of Australia has said, `destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has come forward solely to attempt to correct retrospectively the past policy and administrative incompetence of this government. It is extraordinary that the government has failed to consider entering into negotiations with the claimants to settle their claims, particularly given its knowledge of the questionable constitutional status of the relevant provisions&mdash;that is, section 54RA&mdash;of the Migration Act, which it now seeks to repeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite certain that, if this bill were passed, it would be challenged in the High Court. Legal advice indicates that such a challenge would very likely be successful. Passage of this bill would therefore be unlikely to solve the government's existing problem. It would simply continue the debilitating and unsatisfactory legal wrangles that have been the hallmark in this area of government policy in recent years. A successful challenge would still render the government liable for compensation payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that failure to pass this bill may cause the government to be required to pay compensation to the claimants involved, although, as I have just said, a likely successful High Court challenge to the bill would in any event render the government so liable. The coalition does not believe, however, that considerations of this nature, unfortunate though they may be, should be permitted to override the fundamental objections to this flawed bill, with its breaches of basic principles of law and with all its damaging implications for the future processes of and confidence in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repealing of section 54RA, the one section which differentiates this bill from the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), does not in any way change the coalition's attitude to this bill. We supported the introduction of section 54RA a couple of years ago, when it was introduced, to cap the potential compensation payable. Its repealing at this stage is simply yet another cynical exercise designed merely to buy the government more time on this matter. If the government were really serious about repealing section 54RA, it would have facilitated it through separate legislation rather than tacking it on to this already fundamentally flawed bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go briefly into the background to this whole matter. Unauthorised arrivals in the form of what we call `boat people'&mdash;mainly Cambodians but Chinese, Vietnamese and some other nationals as well&mdash;began in Australia in November 1989. They were detained under section 88 of the Migration Act. Section 88 is said in the act to apply to `Custody of certain persons during stay of vessel in port'. Early in 1992 several of the Cambodian detainees challenged the legal right of the government to detain them under section 88, which was the only section of the act that could possibly be used as the basis for their detention. This challenge became known as the Lim case after one of the plaintiffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 May 1992, two days before the plaintiff's action for release was due to commence in the courts, the government rushed amendments to the Migration Act through the parliament&mdash;with the support of the coalition. The amendments introduced a new division 4B into the act which validated the continued detention of `a non-citizen who has been on a boat in the territorial sea of Australia after 19 November 1989 and'&mdash;in effect&mdash;`before 1 September 1994'. Of course, 1 September 1994 was the date for the commencement of the new Migration Act which subsumed the past legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its decision in the Lim case, handed down on 8 December 1992, the High Court upheld the constitutional validity of division 4B. In its comments, however, it expressed the view that section 88 had not authorised any detention of the plaintiffs prior to 6 May 1992, and that such detention had been unlawful. A majority of the judges held that detention ceased to be lawful under section 88 after the destruction of the boat on which the person arrived or, in other circumstances, if the boat was made unavailable for the person's departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation that boat people who were now lawfully detained under division 4B after 6 May 1992 might bring a common law action for damages for unlawful detention for the period prior to 6 May 1992, the government rushed through the parliament in late December 1992 another amendment. That was the introduction of the new section 54RA to the Migration Act. This section extinguished the common law right of action for damages for unlawful imprisonment of boat people prior to 6 May 1992, and replaced the common law right with a statutory right, capping the amount of damages payable at $1 per day. The coalition supported that bill, but only after strenuously making it clear that it would not have done so if the bill had contained any element of retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime purpose of the December 1992 bill was to limit the impact of any damages claim made by those deemed illegally detained, although it did contain other amendments to the act in an attempt to put beyond doubt certain aspects of the detention process. In this respect, it extended coverage to include people arriving by boat on or after 1 December 1992 until the commencement of the Migration Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 54RA is being challenged in the High Court by 88 of the Cambodians who arrived in Australia by boat prior to May 1992. The High Court was listed to hear the action on 9 October this year. The reason for the introduction of this bill is to encourage the High Court&mdash;which it has done&mdash;to postpone the hearing of that case. I think it is now listed for April 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious argument for the challenge is that the diminution of the claim for damages constitutes an acquisition without just terms, contrary to section 51, placitum (xxxi), of the constitution. On 9 March 1994 the High Court gave judgment in four cases concerning the acquisitions power. One of those cases, Georgiadis v. AOTC, has clear similarities to the case being heard by the High Court in a few months time. In the Georgiadis case a majority of the court held:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that extinguishing a course of action for damages in tort against the Commonwealth or one of its agencies amounted to an "acquisition" of property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the government has been advised by its own Solicitor-General that, unless sufficient grounds are made out to distinguish the current case from Georgiadis, it must now be expected that section 54RA will also be held to be invalid. I also understand that the Solicitor-General has advised that there were doubts as to the efficacy of section 54RA when it was first enacted, and that the Georgiadis decision has simply elevated earlier reasoned doubts to near certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further understand that the Solicitor-General has concluded that an amendment to section 88, to give it the effect that the government previously thought it had, may be acceptable to the High Court, and that it is on this advice that the government is now seeking to act in the bill before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is known as `curative legislation', and relies on a line of United States cases and one previous High Court decision. But there are very considerable doubts, as I understand it, as to how confident the government could be about the curative argument. Indeed, I understand that the Solicitor-General has said only that it might have reasonable chances of surviving a constitutional attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill were passed, and if it withstood an inevitable strong challenge in the High Court, it would make lawful what the High Court now regards to be unlawful&mdash;that is, the detention of boat people who arrived in Australia between November 1989 and May 1992. As I said, the bill is totally retrospective in this aspect. It applies only to this period of 2 1/2 years to 6 May 1992, almost five years ago and stretching back well beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the request of both ourselves and the Australian Democrats, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;which, as I have mentioned, is almost identical to this bill&mdash;was referred to the Senate constitutional and legal affairs committee after its introduction into the Senate on 7 June. Before that consideration by the constitutional and legal affairs committee, it was examined by the scrutiny of bills committee. The scrutiny of bills committee was quite damning in its criticism of the bill, particularly with respect to its retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate constitutional and legal affairs committee tabled its report on the bill in the Senate on Monday, 29 August. The committee divided along party lines. Coalition members&mdash;Senators Vanstone, Ellison and O'Chee&mdash;opposed the bill. May I publicly congratulate them for what I think was the quite excellent work they put into the work of that committee. Although government members on the committee supported the bill, it is quite clear from the report and the drafting of it that at least some of them held real concerns about bill No. 2, which they obviously still would have to share about this current bill No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All witnesses at the constitutional and legal affairs committee public hearings&mdash;with the one exception of the representatives from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;strongly opposed the bill. The main objections were objections of legal principle. The Law Council gave three basic objections which reflected the views of the others, because the sole purpose of the bill was to defeat the High Court challenge to section 54RA of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three fundamental objections that the Law Council gave were, firstly, that the bill distorts the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government; secondly, that it `strikes at the very basis of the argument that the common law provides adequate protection against infringement by government of civil liberties'; and, thirdly, that it condones&mdash;entrenches&mdash;the proposition `that wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken the parliament may act retrospectively to cure that. This would destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system'. The Law Council rejected outright the government's argument that the bill is merely curative. As I said earlier, the Solicitor-General apparently also has raised doubts as to whether the High Court would accept the curative argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that the government's claim that, at the time of the unlawful detention, the minister and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs thought the law gave them the power to detain these people in custody is open to serious question. An internal departmental memo, dated 27 June 1992, presented in evidence to the constitutional and legal affairs committee, expressed the view that destruction of the vessels on which asylum seekers arrived would be likely to result in the automatic ceasing of custody as defined in section 88, leading to an order for release by a court. So, in other words, way back in the middle of 1992 the department was expressing real concerns about the legislative basis for the actions that it was taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the latest in a long string of actions by this government to attempt to correct policy and administrative failures in the immigration area. If this bill were passed, there would be no guarantee that that would be the end of it. Indeed, the contrary is much more likely to be the case. As I have said, the bill is, on the whole, essentially retrospective. The bill, on the government's own frank admission, has been introduced solely to make lawful what is now unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has nothing at all to do with ongoing detention. The question of ongoing detention was settled in May 1992, and it was again addressed with the advent of the Migration Reform Act of 1 September. As I have said before, the bill breaches several basic principles of law. It is quite certain that, if it is passed, it will be challenged in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial implications of this matter cannot be estimated with any certainty. It is thought that there could be around 350 persons potentially eligible for compensation for unlawful imprisonment if the bill is rejected and if the High Court upholds the challenge to section 54RA, assuming that section still exists if these matters go ahead. It is likely, however, that the actual number of people would be much less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates vary as to likely compensation payments. One quite extreme upper figure of $200,000 per person has been mentioned by one source. If that were the average, and 300 people received this amount, the total payout would be $60 million. However, it is virtually certain that the amount would be very significantly less than this. The number of applicants is likely to be well less than 300, and the average compensation payment very much less than $200,000. I stress this: the passage of the bill would not necessarily protect the revenue anyway, because a High Court challenge to it could be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition hopes that, in the event of the High Court ruling section 54RA unconstitutional as expected in April next year, any consequential compensation determination would take full account of all the circumstances. These include the fact that in many cases those who were detained for long periods of time were detained of their own volition because they chose to pursue their applications for refugee status in the courts after failing to accept rejection decisions at the two-tier administrative level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the possible claimants are now back in their country of origin after having their claims for refugee status refused. The relative cost of living in the applicant's country should be taken into account. Therefore, we are strongly of the view that any compensation that was payable should certainly be nominal compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that, in view of the fact that the bill is retrospective, it breaches several basic principles of law, it is designed solely to make lawful what is unlawful and it was introduced in an attempt to cover past policy and administrative failures by the government, the coalition will vote against it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 is similar to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) in all material aspects.

So why waste the time of the Senate, except to provide the government with the first leg of a double dissolution trigger?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill continues, as the No. 2 bill did, to retrospectively authorise the detention of asylum seekers and to remove the right to obtain proper compensation for unlawful detention, even though the matter is before the High Court, where the government expects to receive an unfavourable decision. To pass this bill would be to condone an executive government changing the law to avoid legal liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also offends against the principle of separation of powers, and the right of citizens to obtain just compensation when property or the right to property is appropriated by government. As has been said before, it is also likely to be challenged on the grounds that the bill deals with matters beyond the constitutional power to legislate on matters concerning aliens.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, if passed, would certainly be subject to challenge in the High Court and hence would prolong rather than end the now long drawn-out process in the courts on this matter. It should be rejected. The Australian Democrats will be voting against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long awaited Senate discussion on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 and, indeed, the earlier piece of legislation, is welcomed by those on this side of the chamber for the very simple reason that it gives the Senate, the upper house of the Australian parliament, the opportunity to make a choice between the lawful, law abiding, taxpaying citizens of this country and some people who have chosen to take the laws of Australia into their own hands, breach our migration laws and determine that they know better as to whether or not they should be allowed to settle in this country. It is a very clear and stark choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I issue a challenge now to those opposite and to my colleagues from the Greens (WA) to go out into the community and debate publicly the provisions contained in this legislation. Let members of the community take a stand on whether they support this legislation or whether they support the possibility of Australian taxpayers forking out up to $100 million in compensation for people who were held unlawfully for a short time and who initially had arrived illegally in this country. That is a challenge that I hope will be taken up. I already know who is going to win because of the responses that are coming into my office from right around Western Australia and from many other parts of Australia. The community is not supportive of the actions of the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens in what I think they intend to do by voting this bill down later this morning. That is a sad reflection on them and the abrogation of their responsibilities to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to correct part of what Senator Short said in his speech. He said that a challenge to section 88 of the Migration Act was mounted in the High Court. That is not true. With regard to the people in question, the people held in what is now deemed to be a technically unlawful situation for a period of 2 1/2 years, never at any time during that 2 1/2 year period was there a legal challenge mounted against the lawfulness of their custody. Nobody in any of the courts challenged the validity of that section. Section 88 and the possibility of unlawfulness came to public notice when the High Court, in adjudicating in the Lim case, which Senator Short correctly identified, drew attention to it. But it was not the question which was under the scrutiny of the High Court at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have been involved in this issue since the first boat arrived here in November 1989, including some eminent legal persons from around Australia. Certainly, at least one judge who comes to mind has made public statements. But until the High Court handed down the Lim decision nobody drew any attention to the possibility of unlawfulness in respect of that section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is itemised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, the bill that preceded the piece of legislation now before the Senate. I wish to emphasise this point because much has been written about this saga. Indeed, a great deal has been written on the topic by the advocates and supporters of the boat people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Refugee Council of Australia, which was engaged by government to provide legal representation to people held in detention and which issued many statements and reports during that time. Never once did it draw attention to the possibility that section 88 might be unlawful. We know that the High Court drew attention to that matter. I do not knock the High Court for doing its job, but it has created a problem for the government. It was an unfortunate error that people were held under the provisions of that section, but the error once pointed out was corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that once the error was pointed out, some people took the view `Aha, we can make a quid out of this.' This affected the boat people themselves and, more likely, their legal representatives, many of whom had given their services and time free of charge to the litigants. If ultimately there is an award of damages to such people for unlawful detention, undoubtedly the lawyers who provided their services free of charge at the time will now be able to claim back from the individuals who receive compensation. Some, if not all, the fees will be able to be claimed, and of course the cost will fall on the taxpayer. Obviously Australian citizens are charged fees by lawyers when they act for them in normal legal procedures that take place daily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short intervenes to say that it is unrealistic, and people have said that the figure is somewhat fanciful. However, I do not think we should be so eager to dismiss the figure. The claim was made in a submission by an eminent individual who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The lady in question made her submission in writing and elaborated on her claim under questioning by members of the committee. The person who made the claim was Dr Mary Crock, a lawyer and publisher who has written many books, one of which is to be published shortly according to evidence she gave to the committee. I do not think Dr Crock should be dismissed easily. She is held in very high regard within the community that she associates with, namely, those who support refugees. I do not wish to knock such people, because indeed I support refugees. However, I have problems with people who support those who purport to be refugees. The sum of $100 million, if finally awarded through the court processes, will come from the pockets of taxpayers; taxpayers who have had enough of the exploitation of the system that has now gone on for almost five years&mdash;since 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude I want to record my congratulations to Mr Matthew Rendall and his wife, Sapor Yun, who were recently married in Cambodia. Mr Rendall&mdash;Senator Short would know him as well as I do because we met him in the course of a different committee's deliberations&mdash;was one of the lawyers engaged by the Refugee Council of Australia and acting for some of the boat people who were detained at Port Hedland. Love did blossom in the detention camp in Port Hedland, I am very pleased to record, and I am also very pleased to record that they have now publicly solemnised their marriage and will next year, upon their return to Australia, further solemnise it under Australian law, which is somewhat different from Cambodian law. I am sure Senator Short and, indeed, the minister would join me in passing on their congratulations to Mr Rendall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I record this for another reason&mdash;to draw attention to the fact that Sapor Yun was a claimant for refugee status in this country. Her application, after it had been considered, was rejected. She appealed through the administrative appeal processes and was rejected, but yet continued to remain in this country because she feared to go back to Cambodia. She has now been back in Cambodia for quite a considerable period, and we see in a photograph in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of Saturday, 5 November that she is quite hale and hearty, and obviously very happy in her own country. That is a further indication of some of the exploitation and abuse of Australia's compassion in this area that started with the arrival of the first boat, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pender Bay</EMPHASIS>, in November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by using some of the words I used in  a written addendum to the report of the legal and constitutional affairs committee in August of this year. I said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One advocate has suggested that those damages could amount to a total of over $96 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is timely to repeat, for the record, that no individual or organisation had challenged the lawfulness of section 88 prior to the High Court reference to it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lim</EMPHASIS> judgment. It is clear to me that the Parliament, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Community, the boat people and their legal representatives all understood and accepted the lawfulness of section 88, at least until May 1992, when the High Court drew the matter to public attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now obvious that the High Court's reference to section 88 not only exposed a deficiency in the legislation, but also alerted boat people and their lawyers to the potential of a windfall gain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McKiernan said, the Senate has before it yet another try at the migration legislation. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is very similar to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and is yet another sad and sorry chapter in the government's response to the arrival of a few hundred boat people in the years since 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As time has passed, the response from the government has become increasingly hysterical, in both its public statements and its legislative attempts to deal with what it obviously considers to be a major problem. But, increasingly, we are seeing that the government's legislative response is trying to turn back the clock. I wish the government would turn it back as far as the time when our country was noted for its compassionate, warm response to the Vietnamese boat people. However, the government is not turning it back that far. This bill is the most blatant and obnoxious example of turning the clock back to the degree of retrospectively making legal by parliament what was found to be illegal by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, having been told that it detained asylum seekers in custody unlawfully, now wants the parliament to retrospectively declare that the detention was legal after all. In the long saga of the asylum seekers who are being held in Port Hedland or Villawood, this action merely confirms what many of us have been saying for a long time. The government is concerned about border control and about the political messages that would be sent out if it allowed people to stay and it will do anything to deny these people right of entry. It is vindictive in the extreme towards the individuals concerned and constantly has one eye on its trade relationships, which it puts before human lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has waged an increasingly hysterical campaign of public vilification against these people who have fled their countries because they have feared persecution and they dared to think that Australia was a free and fair country. I think some of the politicians in this place may need to be advised that the government's intended racial hatred bill may be of some personal relevance to them in the light of comments that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Broome Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of 11 August, which reports on a speech Senator McKiernan made to an ALP dinner. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McKiernan said the illegal immigrants were callously abusing Australian generosity with their courtroom escapades.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from a member of the government which has spent millions of dollars keeping these people locked up when they could have been looked after at far less cost by community groups which offered to do so. This is from a member of the government which has appealed almost every decision made in favour of this people. This is from a member of the government which, having created the supposedly independent Refugee Review Tribunal, is now challenging decisions made by that very tribunal because it had the gall to find in favour of the applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government is not content to stop there. It wants to use the lawyers who work for the asylum seekers as a whipping post as well. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Broome Advertiser</EMPHASIS> once again quotes Senator McKiernan. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenges are possible because lawyers give their services free of charge to the illegal immigrants.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator McKiernan also gave the game away in his speech. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Broome Advertiser</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>

<PARA>and I presume he is referring to the policy of detaining the boat people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had not deterred the boat people who continued to lodge actions on legal technicalities while the Government had paid for expensive legal defences.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an extraordinary admission from the senator who, as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, insisted that the detention policy must be upheld even though no evidence was provided to the committee to suggest that detention deters anybody from coming. Indeed, the arrival earlier this year of a group which had already been in detention in Australia once, had been deported and decided to risk the journey again, shows how pathetic a justification the notion of deterrence is. It is quite apart from the fact that deterrence is not a just principle upon which to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is all about the very legal technicalities which the government complains the boat people keep using. Courts have found out that the government and the department were not doing their jobs properly and they have found in favour of the boat people, so now we have more legislation to cover-up the cracks. What is more, it is not only the cracks that are being covered. The government is also trying to cover its sad and sorry tracks, which meander about the legal and legislative landscape of recent history.

It will be a terrific political statement we can make that the government, in spite of itself, was unable to prevent the opposition supporting its own legislation, removing this reprehensible clause and making the taxpayer have to re-double the expenditure, which is already hundreds of millions of dollars, on detaining refugees illegally.'</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not owe them the duty that we owe Australian citizens. These people came here uninvited. They are asylum seekers and we can do with them as we wish.' But the flaw in that argument is this: the government comes before this parliament and asks it to rubber stamp its illegal and unprincipled actions, but when Australians are unlawfully detained in another country this same government seeks a different standard from that country. Australians are absolutely outraged when Australian citizens are unlawfully detained in other countries. We hear no end of complaint.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's concern for human rights is a sham. It is almost contemptuous. Its concern for human rights goes as far as it thinks there is electoral advantage in it. That is what this is all about. That is why this government is so embarrassed. That is why this government's only speaker on this legislation, apart from the minister, was Senator McKiernan. Nobody on that side who is really interested in human rights can say that this is a good piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one final principle which must be upheld: everybody is subject to the law. If a government which is found to be in breach of the law can solve its problems by retrospectively validating what it has done in relation to these people, what is to stop it retrospectively validating what it has illegally done in relation to anybody else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the real principle at stake here. It is about holding government accountable to the laws that government makes. If a government is allowed to say, `Look, sorry, we did something illegal. We want to retrospectively fix it up. Here, rubber stamp this piece of legislation,' what protection is there for any of us? That is the real question of principle which the government must answer. The truth is that there is no protection for anyone in this country whilst this government retrospectively validates its illegal, unprincipled and immoral actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I was listening to the utterings over the last hour or so, I could not help thinking of their total irrelevance to many of the issues that the debate has drifted onto and, in that context, thinking of the real problem confronting Western democracies like our own when it comes to the question of refugees, of asylum seekers, and of the processing people who seek asylum status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an issue that confronts just Australia; it is an issue that confronts the world. It is an issue which is extremely costly to the world and it is an issue which is extremely costly to us. EEC countries, for instance, spend over $10 billion a year to process people who claim asylum status; we spend quite an amount of money as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that process, there is an underlying principle that when people claim asylum they have to be treated fairly and have their cases assessed. Once assessed, those who are assessed as refugees have a right, but those who are assessed as not being refugees have to go back or go somewhere else. That is the basic principle that we are talking about. We are talking about the need to have legislation to assess and process those claiming asylum status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beneath all that is an appreciation by everybody that not everyone who claims asylum status&mdash;whether they come in one contingent, or by boat, or in any other way&mdash;ipso facto has that status. They have to be processed. The real crisis confronting all nations, including ours, is the cost on resources. Whilst listening to this debate&mdash;listening to those who would throw around money as people with no arms&mdash;I was considering the claimed $150 million that could be lost to the Australian taxpayer as a result of this measure. With that money I could probably double the refugee intake into Australia over the next five to 10 years. I could double the number of those coming in under our humanitarian program&mdash;high as that figure already is. Per capita it is the highest in the world, but we could double that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, I could spend five, six or seven times as much on grants-in-aid for those who come here under the humanitarian program. We could increase tenfold the amount of resources we send to countries such as Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But no, we have to go through this process here because of some stubbornness and, I must admit in respect of the Liberals, some unfortunate activities.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just hold on, I will tell you in a second. We could increase our resources and our intake of humanitarian cases to that magnitude. But we have to go through this process. We have to put at risk $150 million of taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point is that we should not be naive about this. We need to have processes that can be upheld. The Labor Party and the opposition accept that. The Labor Party and the opposition also acknowledge that there is a very high rate of acceptance under our refugee determination processes. We also accept on a bipartisan basis that detention is an integral part of our processing in this area. Quite recently, that principle has been reinforced by a report to the parliament. However, here we have the debate being gazumped on the other side. I feel a little sad about the difficulties Senator Short has. The debate has been gazumped by the members of the legal committee on the other side&mdash;people coming here with a legal rather than a broader immigration perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few years ago Phil Ruddock understood the broader policy imperatives. A few months ago Senator Short understood them as well. But we have had the debate gazumped by those who are not really experienced in this area. As a result, we are now talking about protecting the rights of those who arrived here illegally&mdash;and we are not distinguishing between citizens and non-citizens; we are distinguishing between those who come to Australia legally and those who come to Australia illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are protecting those who, in many cases, probably are not even in this country and who under our processes have been rejected as refugees. We are doing so in a way that does not allow this government to act in accordance with international law. That is the advice we have had. What we are doing is in accordance with international law; we are doing it in accordance with the principles governing our constitution. Why is that the case? Because we are overcoming a technicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the case in 1992 that Senator Short and Senator McKiernan mentioned, it was understood by everyone that section 88 of the legislation applied in these cases. It was understood to the extent that, yes, there was some discussion about it. But the firm advice was that it was a law that could apply, and it could apply to maintain in detention those who had visited Australia illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was applied and accepted to such an extent that even those acting on behalf of the boat people and the boat people themselves did not raise the possibility that section 88 was the inappropriate section. That is why what we are doing today is strictly in accordance with what we can do and in accordance with international principles. That is why what we are doing today is quite acceptable. We are seeking to give our legislation the force that we all thought it had at the time it applied&mdash;at the time when customs officers in this country held people who had arrived here illegally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the loophole, what was this little kink in our laws discovered by the High Court that made section 88 the  inappropriate section? The High Court felt that the section we are concerned about would apply only in cases where the boat on which people arrived was a boat in transit and that these people could be held for so long as that boat was in Australia. It was not a question about detention; the issue of detention was not in dispute. But the fact that the boat was not going on to Antarctica, or to New Zealand or go backwards was the technicality. What a technicality to place at risk $150 million!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder the heads of opposition senators hang in shame, because that is the technicality we are talking about. That is precisely why this government feels that we are in order to do what we are doing here. It is an innocent, technical breach of the legislation. We are restoring its original intent and it is an acceptance which everyone, including the boat people and their legal representatives, understood to be the applicable meaning of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have now? We are in a situation where some 350 or so people who arrived here illegally are claiming compensation. We have heard tossed quite flippantly around this chamber this morning, `Well, it's only $150 million that they are claiming.' Senator Short says, `I'm certain they won't get it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are those principles? They are principles that emanate from international covenants and treaties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill went to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I imagine that my colleague Senator Ellison might want to say something about that later. There is just one particular aspect I want to raise in relation to some amendments being moved by the government subsequent to the hearing. These amendments were not canvassed at the hearing, but the Attorney-General wrote to the then chairman of the committee, Senator Cooney, advising him of these amendments which, by and large, are uncontroversial. There is just one aspect that I think is probably all right; therefore, we would not seek to delay the passage of the bill because of it, but it does deserve an airing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators might remember, under the crimes search warrants and procedures legislation magistrates need to give approval for certain searches to be undertaken. As I understand it, as a consequence of a case generally referred to as the Grollo case, that sort of work is regarded as being administrative work. Federally, because we try to keep a close watch on the constitutional requirement to keep a separation of powers, we do not want to give judicial officers administrative tasks and vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where magistrates who normally do work for the states have been happy to take on work for the Commonwealth. There are people in each state ready to do this work, but they are concerned of the position they might be in because, if they are acting in a federal capacity, there might not be a separation of powers. So someone had the bright idea, which was apparently used in the telecommunications interception legislation and in customs legislation as well, of how to solve this problem. The idea was that we would not give them this power in their judicial capacity and that we would give it to them in their personal capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People instantly think that is okay because they can have it in their personal capacity; that is, until they think about it a bit. While they are thinking about it someone says, `And by the way, we'll also give them immunity from civil action in case they make a mistake when exercising this power.' In other words, to all intents and purposes we will get as close as we can to treating them as judicial officers and get them to do this administrative work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That begs the question whether this scheme would be seen on closer reflection as being just a ruse, a sort of veneer, to get over the problem of separation of powers. It is a problem we have more so than the states. It is not a problem for the states. They do not have such a closely restricted set of constitutional arrangements that require them to keep such a distinct separation, so it is okay for them. But, as I understand it, the Commonwealth advice is that since the Grollo case it is not okay for us. So the magistrates understandably say, `Well, look, we don't mind doing this work for you,' and the states, in their capacity as states, say, `Well, we don't mind our magistrates doing this work either.' But if we are going to give it to them in the personal capacity, they need to have this protection. I suspect it is a bit of veneer and something that, in the end, we need to look at more closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, to our shame we have missed this sort of problem before. Some of the bankruptcy legislation comes to mind where there was a keen rush to get bankrupts who could also be described as crooks and who escaped with their money to ensure that they gave as much of their money, as properly should go to creditors, to creditors. Because of that we gave some sort of capacity to the receiver to make a declaration of certain matters and then to register it, I think, if there was no objection, as an order of the court. Perhaps there did not even need to be an objection, I think people just make the declaration and go and do it. The whole thing was thrown out because we forgot that what we were doing was giving someone, other than a judicial officer, judicial powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was pointed out, it was as clear as a bell to everyone. We said, `Oh, yes, that is clear. We will fix that,' but we did not see it at the time when it was staring at us. Maybe there is not a problem in using this ruse&mdash;and I am not using that as a pejorative term, I just cannot think of another way to describe what I mean&mdash;to get around this problem. Maybe it is not a problem because the states do not have this need to keep such a distinction. But I suspect there is a problem there that we have not yet completely isolated. That is the matter I would like us to look at in the future. It is going to happen more and more, one imagines, where we will want&mdash;commonsense prevailing&mdash;cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth, and there may be other areas where we want judicial officers to undertake administrative tasks. I do not think, therefore, that this is just an isolated incident that we can sweep under the carpet and not worry about until later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government may say, `Why are you agreeing to it today?' I have been convinced today that it is okay, but that is because I have only seen the arguments at first blush and I see the need to get this system working. I also understand that no-one may challenge it, so it might be effective for quite awhile, in any event. But that does not mean that one should not flag the problem and ask that we look at it to see if we can resolve it for future times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is the only particular matter that I want to raise. I understand that the government, in the fifth amendment, is deleting the amendments to the Trade Practices Act because it was thought that they would extend police powers. I understand the argument that it did not. It actually narrowed it down but, nonetheless, that amendment has been given away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment by the government is the one I have just dealt with. I am trying to get over this problem of what is and what is not judicial power. The third amendment relates to some copyright matters and seems to be inconsequential, as does the second amendment, in relation to the Law Officers Act. I remind senators that that was to have the capacity to always have someone who could step in as the Solicitor-General, and we were happy to accept that. But then there was a problem because Gavan Griffith is off at the UN&mdash;there is already someone acting in his place&mdash;and I understand this amendment needed to make sure that the acting person at the moment is not affected by that and it will all be okay. I suppose they are words we really have to watch out for when a government says them to us, but I do understand the purpose of the amendment. It seems perfectly sensible, so we have no concern with it. I look forward to the passage of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill introduces a pro rata payment threshold on the repayment of HECS liabilities for students who leave full-time education for the first time. These changes, which I will detail in a moment, we will oppose because we believe they are inequitable and unfair, and because the provisions contain what seem to us to be unexplainable anomalies. There are, however, other provisions in the bill which we either support or will not oppose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other amendments include removing the restriction on the number of units for which an eligible client under the open learning deferred payments scheme may defer payment in the first semester of study, an amendment to the maximum level of grant funding available under certain provisions of the act to reflect the revised amount available following verification of relevant HECS information, and an amendment to provide for the transfer of funds to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. There is a minor change to the definition of overseas student to ensure that members of foreign armed forces studying in Australia pay full fees rather than HECS. There are also some technical amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992 and the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, we are not opposing these matters but we do oppose the attempt to introduce pro rata payments of HECS. We believe that this bill is probably just the first of a series of such changes that are going to be forced upon students who have incurred a HECS liability. It has been estimated that the effect of the pro rata payments part of the legislation will be to bring forward the payment of $5 million for each of the next three years. It should be stressed that this is not extra revenue, but an attempt by the government to force earlier payment upon students; that is, earlier payment than that which students understood they would have to pay under the HECS arrangement that they entered into at the commencement of their course. The government has offered support for the education of students on the basis that they accept a liability to repay a portion of the cost under HECS. Now the government is bringing forward that liability to the disadvantage of a number of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No notice was given of that. It was not included in the budget. It is one of these measures that the government was seeking to impose upon students without notice until the introduction of this bill. I might say that it is a provision that is not well understood within the student community, and I am sure that as the attempt by government to do it becomes better understood the student community will be extremely disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It fits with the same attitude that the government exhibited when it unilaterally decided to lower the HECS threshold and when it similarly decided in the past to increase the HECS repayment. Over a period of time since the introduction of HECS we have seen further attempts by government to extract greater revenue from students by these means. This is just another step in that series. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to further explain the situation as to the students that this measure will affect and the circumstances in which they will be affected. The pro-rata HECS payment will apply to persons who leave full-time education for the first time and achieve full-time employment within the same financial year. Normally, students finish their course in November or December. If they obtain full-time employment in, say, May or June of the following year, they will have to repay pro-rata HECS for those two months. As the law stands now, they are not obliged to do that because the law applies an annual threshold based on average weekly earnings. On that basis, they would not have passed the threshold and would not be liable for repayment in their first two months of employment. However, if this legislation passes today in its current form, they will then become liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not seem to understand that many of those students leave university having had to support themselves for the whole of their final year. Often they have had to borrow in advance on their anticipated earnings from their anticipated employment. For many of them, vacation income, if they are lucky to get some, or the few months of full-time employment that they get at the end of that one year has to sustain them for the whole of the previous year. Presumably, that is why the government in its original plan did not intend to require repayment of pro-rata HECS during the first few months of their employment. But, for no reason that has been given to the parliament or to students, the government has now changed its mind and decided that they should be paying immediately upon gaining that full-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government understands that many of these students, upon completing their tertiary studies, are in quite difficult financial circumstances. Many have had to borrow to complete their education. Under the system that I understand exists with a number of the private banks, interest repayments are not required during the term of students' studies but are required as soon as they graduate. There are also obligations in respect of ancillary university fees which become immediately liable for repayment, in many instances being payable before students are permitted to graduate. In fact, many students are now having to borrow quite considerable sums of money to maintain themselves during their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that the government has acknowledged that to some extent by providing systems through which students can borrow to pay for their education. But all of these debts immediately become payable as soon as students graduate. That period, therefore, is quite a difficult financial time for students. In such circumstances it is hard to understand why the government has decided to extract from them so early payment of at least part of their HECS liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision also contains a number of strange anomalies. For example, if students have been, say, unemployed because of maternity leave or for some other reason and then get into full-time employment, this provision does not apply at all. There does not seem to be any consistency between the position of those students and people who have, in effect, been out of the work force because of the period that they have been in full-time study. No sensible explanation has been given by the government for that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also states that it is pro rata in that the threshold as a consequence of ceasing full-time education will occur only once in a person's lifetime. Why should that be so? If people return to full-time study and incur a subsequent HECS liability and then complete that course, why should their obligation to repay not start until the beginning of the following financial year? Yet the obligation of students who are completing their first period of full-time study in fact starts earlier. I would have thought logic would suggest that, if anything, it should be the other way round&mdash;that people who have gone back and utilised the system twice might be more likely to expect the earlier obligation rather than the people who are coming out of that first period of full-time education. These anomalies come out of what is a very complex scheme that the government is seeking to apply to students to extract just a small amount of extra revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we suspect that this provision will set a precedent for further legislation which will apply HECS pro rata to any part-time income. There is no doubt, in our collective minds anyway, that the next step by government will be that students' vocational income, provided that it is over average weekly earnings on a proportionate basis, will incur an earlier repayment of HECS liability as well. That seems to us to be the logical next step from what the government is seeking to do by this piece of legislation. But again the government has not come clean in relation to that intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, we therefore do not believe the government has made its case for this earlier repayment of HECS. I think students have been misled by government. They are entitled to be, as I said, quite disappointed by the attitude of government in relation to their circumstances and the attitude of government in not understanding the financial difficulties that are incurred by students in education, and in particular the difficulties that they have when they complete a period of full-time tertiary study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to remove the pro rata payment provisions of this bill. We hope that will receive support from others in this chamber and will be successful.

That is totally unacceptable. The behaviour is not surprising. It is typical, I suppose, of what we know of the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales. I suppose one could say that a new expression has come into the language, and that is `to do a Richo'&mdash;that is, to lie to the parliament and to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>is a review that I have written of that book. Naturally, for space reasons it did not entirely make it, and I understand why cuts have to be made, but I think it important that some of the matters that did not make it into the review for space reasons should be put on record in this chamber. I will do that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a primer on how to lie, cheat and bully one's way to political success, Graham Richardson's book is worth the $39.95. As a compendium of the sort of behaviour that has made politics so unacceptably rotten to so many Australians, it is only partly successful, because it leaves out so many of former Senator Richardson's achievements. Richardson used his trademark facade of disarming apparent honesty to try to convert the anti-democratic practices and political thuggery of a New South Wales right wing warrior into justifiable, often whimsical, commonplace actions that anyone in his situation would have done&mdash;and anyway, the Left was doing it too. His book is `an essay in the accumulation and exercise of power.' The revelations of the Hawke-Keating leadership battle, and before that the Hayden-Hawke war, are illustrations of Richardson's revelling in exercising that power: a surge of adrenaline `better than sex and almost as exciting as a good feed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more remarkable examples of this self-gratification is in his incomplete explanation for deciding to ditch Hawke for Keating after Richardson, Labor's hero in delivering the Green preferences needed to keep Hawke in office in 1990, was denied his request to become minister for transport and communications. The transport bit, of course, was incidental. This job was basically minister for Murdoch, Packer and Black, a set of relationships prized by Hawke himself. An operator like Richardson, with his tribal loyalty to the New South Wales Right, of which Keating was a member, was the last person Hawke would allow to be interposed between himself and such vitally important people, so the job went to good old reliable Beazley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, Peter Barron, the former Hawke staffer now with the Packer group, was the longstanding mate that Richardson phoned in a fury that night, saying of Hawke, `I'll get this bastard; I'll do whatever it takes, but I'll get him.' Richardson's thoroughly unconvincing explanation as to why his not getting communications was so important that it warranted destroying a Labor prime minister raises more questions than it answers. Eventually, after the Keating putsch in December 1991&mdash;20 months later&mdash;Richardson got transport and communications, only to lose it after six months when he resigned over the Marshall Islands affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But was this power really there, or was it mainly in the eye of the press gallery? To an extent Richardson could exercise power because the media, under his enthusiastic prompting, kept on asserting that he was powerful. It is remarkable that this book reveals nothing of how this power was acquired by `a paunchy, urbanised, sedentary'&mdash;according to Hawke&mdash;unprepossessing person who dropped out of university and enjoyed a very non-commanding presence, and how tangible this power really was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power claimed by Richardson goes far beyond that expected of someone who, as Labor's general secretary, knows where a lot of bodies are buried, was helpful in various pre-selections, is owed plenty because of his patronage, and was an astute numbers man in Canberra. The left wing of the ALP in New South Wales had strong views about Richardson's use of power, which it categorised as an abuse of power in a document with that title in 1982. I quote from it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For years, decent party members were subject to a nightmare of intimidation, death threats and actual violence as a result of the penetration of party branches by an element with close links to organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA>The Left complained, blaming in particular, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Richardson's support and protection of the extreme and sinister stacking operations that existed in the inner city up until the (Hon Peter) Baldwin bashing in July 1980 . . . Richardson's protection of this criminal penetration of the party was a crime against the party and the people of NSW.</PARA>
<PARA>Richardson admits in his book that he should have acted quicker to clean up this corruption, even though the practice of branch stacking and rorting of branch books was, as he said, `a tradition to which I was instinctively attracted and which I felt bound to protect.'  But he also blames the Left and seems to consider this to be a political mistake rather than an ethical mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Faulkner, now a Senate cabinet minister, but who was then the ALP's Assistant General Secretary in New South Wales, had an office near Richardson on the ninth floor of Labor's Sussex Street headquarters. When Richardson was being farewelled last March, Senator Faulkner told the Senate that, even though they saw each other 30 or 40 times a day, they did not exchange one word for eight months. He said that Richardson had `supported the very worst elements' of the right wing inner city political machines, and had `misplaced tribal loyalties'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is little of this in the book, with only a passing reference to standover man Tom Domican as `one of Joe Meissner's offsiders,' despite evidence that Domican had worked closely with head office as a branch stacker and, according to the left wing's 1985 conference report, was `a frequent and welcome visitor in Richardson's and Loosley's office' as well as continually threatening Faulkner in the lift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mention at all of Richo's `very close friend . . . like a father to me,' Danny Casey, and his criminal associates from Balmain Welding and Wings Travel, as outlined before the Woodward royal commission where Richardson acknowledged that he knew them. But to Richardson they were just `characters', as Fia Cumming says in her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mates</EMPHASIS>. He saw them not as common criminals but as `part of that racy inner-city old Labor tradition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others who have featured so prominently in Richardson's political life, yet do not rate one mention in the book, include Warren Anderson&mdash;he is also a mate, of course, of the Prime Minister's&mdash;and John Roberts of Multiplex, the big commercial builders, who moved into housing construction only to build the extensions to Richardson's North Shore house, and who also took Richardson to China as a facilitator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Bond does not get a mention, nor does Laurie Connell, whom Richardson appointed to the board of the Australian National Gallery before replacing him with Richardson's other old mate, Rene Rivkin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no mention of Sarah G. Richardson is also coy about revealing the manner in which he used a compliant Canberra press gallery which, in its enthusiasm to be an unelected, unrepresentative and irresponsible participant in the political process&mdash;rather than to report or interpret it&mdash;was readily available to be lied to and manipulated. Some of Richo's best mates are journalists. Laurie Oakes, that consistent critic of the coalition, who described my official Australian Securities Commission documents revealing improper behaviour and breaches of the corporation law by Mr Keating's piggery as `unsubstantiated muckraking', is the same Laurie Oakes who is a close enough mate of Richardson's to have checked his manuscript for him. And he is appropriately thanked in the introduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Richardson poses the personal dilemmas involved when he `had to reconcile personal and factional loyalties, weigh up conscience against threat, personal integrity against the welfare of the party and, of course, the public lie against the private truth', there was an inevitability about the manner of their resolution. `Not every reader will approve the way in which I have conducted myself over the last 20 years. The Marquess of Queensberry's rules never applied to Labor.' Naturally his political hero was Neville Wran who `just did it without worrying too much about the niceties of democracy.' The lie became former Senator Richardson's tool of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense for him to plead that the Westminster system requires politicians to lie. His colleagues in cabinet now protest that they do not lie, but it does seem clearly to have become part of the culture of the New South Wales Labor right wing, which has created the new synonym for political lying, `Doing a Richo.' I would assume that his factional colleagues have now learnt from his example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make Richardson a political hero is, on the basis of his own book, to diminish even further the status and standing of politicians. It is to tar all politicians with the Richardson brush, to set him up as the standard, so that those of us who refuse to live by Richo's rotten rules are dismissed as wimps, incompetents and easybeats. His dictum that `power is attractive and absolute power is irresistible' reinforces Lord Acton's admonition that power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. The problem is that those corrupted by power seldom recognise the fact. On the evidence of this book, it is fortunate that Mr Richardson has forsaken political power for journalism, or does even greater power now reside in the media?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the media, it is extraordinary that following a most decisive decision by the Senate yesterday&mdash;a vote of 42 to 24 to defeat this government&mdash;I have detected only two members of the print media which have covered that fact in today's newspapers, and they are the Sydney<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> and the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> did not think it was important enough to recognise what happened in this chamber yesterday and neither, as I could find, did many other newspapers or television stations. It was mentioned, however, on the ABC this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the chamber what happened yesterday that had to be censored, or was not news, or that people in the media did not feel it appropriate to say something about which would be critical of this Prime Minister. It was agreed here yesterday that a Senate committee should inquire into the adequacy of the disclosure provisions for Australian prime ministers who acquire assets while in office, and this followed an overwhelming defeat for the government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was defeated by 42 votes to 24 when it opposed my motion to refer to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee the question of disclosure and accountability of prime ministers for their acquisitions of assets and liabilities while in office for report by 1 December. I said at the time that there was no specific requirement for prime ministers to meet the standards required of ministers who must be accountable by revealing to their Prime Minister details of their financial situation; I said that there is no-one to whom prime ministers should be accountable. The fact that the motion was supported by the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, after I accepted a Democrat amendment to include the Leader of the Opposition in the reference, is of some significance. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition does not exercise executive power means that that amendment was nonsensical, but I was quite happy to accept it because this was a significant resolution by this Senate. According to the bulk of the media it was not a fact; it did not exist.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that members of the opposition would never be game to write a book about their own history or themselves because they have got none; and they are not quite sure which side they are going to end up on anyway. We can dismiss what they have got to say and just watch tonight's ABC program on the machinations that go on there and how many backs have been stabbed. So let us not bother to delve into these areas, but let us talk about issues that are of more concern to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I wish to address an issue which I have raised here before, which relates to the provision of goods and hampers to drought affected areas. I have raised concerns before about the fact that donations in the form of goods were being sent from city areas to the rural areas that are drought affected, and the effect that this has upon the small businesses and the supermarkets within those communities. It means that, if food hampers and goods are sent, the small businesses and the small shopkeepers in the communities are not able to sell their produce and their goods. They are suffering a cash flow problem and will continue to do so. It is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had conversations with a number of the organisations that are involved in the provision of aid to the affected areas. They all tell me that the best way to provide aid is by the use of money. I have spoken to the farmhand appeal; I have spoken to the Smith Family; I have spoken to the Salvation Army people; I have spoken to people from St Vincent de Paul and Careforce. They all tell me that the best way to provide aid is to provide cash, because this cash can be given to the people in those areas, they can then prioritise their greatest needs and use the money for them&mdash;and not be sent a parcel that might contain two tins of Milo when there is nobody in the house that drinks Milo. It is a waste of time, money and effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the mayor of Gilgandra, Carol Stockham, has appeared on the media asking anyone making a donation to make that donation in money so that the money can be spent in the businesses in those communities. I have also spoken to Councillor Wally Mitchell, the President of the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales, who expresses the same concern. That is, if we are going to help the rural areas&mdash;and people should be helping the rural areas by making donations&mdash;then let us maximise the assistance we give. Let us help both the farmers and the small businesses. To do this, the best way is to make cash donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that in my home town of Bathurst, and also in Orange, Coles has a big box in the supermarket saying, `Help the farmers: donate non-perishable goods' so it can give a hamper. There may be the odd Coles supermarket in the small communities, but usually the major supermarket chains do not have a presence there&mdash;and if they do, there will only be one. Usually it is a local small business person who is running a supermarket. By sending non-perishable goods to these communities, people are reducing the amount of income that these businesses receive and run the risk of sending those people out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that when the drought is over, and even before then, people in Bourke, say, would have to travel to Dubbo to do their basic commodity shopping. Now we have the situation where people are crying out because small country towns are already under threat from the larger towns. The larger towns and communities provide a very valuable support, but the smaller communities are under threat. Sending goods to drought afflicted areas runs the risk of undermining these small businesses and towns even further, and removing any support mechanisms that might be there now and that might be needed for future times. By all means, donate to these hampers, but let us see whether we can do something like having big raffles in the areas that can afford to donate goods and raise a lot of money, then give that money to farmhand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmhand project is still alive and well. The government is offering a dollar for dollar donation and at this stage has given in excess of $6 million to farmhand. Farmhand is now targeting its donations and assistance to the areas just outside the exceptionally drought declared areas, so that those who in the next few months, if the drought does not break, are declared to be in exceptional drought circumstances will be able to get some assistance from farmhand. It is vitally important that we look at the best ways of providing this assistance. The best way is to donate money to farmhand, to the Salvation Army, to the Smith Family, to St Vincent de Paul&mdash;to one of the agencies there to help people. They have all told me that cash is the best way, because it enables people to meet their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Bourke and Enngonia last week I was talking to a number of people who had received assistance from farmhand. The sorts of things that they had used the money for varied markedly. Somebody had lost a house and its contents in a fire. For that person the most urgent priority was not to buy groceries; it was to get a fridge to put in the house to put things in. For somebody else it was to pay the telephone bill. They had worked out in their own budgets what their highest priorities were, and their highest priorities were not food parcels but other necessities of life. If we give people money, financial assistance, they are able to make decisions for themselves as to what their priorities are and it is less of a charitable type of thing. It is very important that we actually look at how we can assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make cash donations is a way to have a win-win situation or, rather, a win-in-win situation. The farmers can win by receiving cash amounts to spend as their priorities and needs dictate. The local communities can benefit because the farmers will spend the money in their local communities and keep the businesses and infrastructure in these communities going. The people donating can know that they are getting the maximum benefit for their dollar. They can also be allowed to feel good about being able to help, and know that their assistance is not in the long term going to have a detrimental effect upon the communities and infrastructure in these small rural areas. It is absolutely essential that this be looked at, and looked at carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not telling people not to donate and I am not wanting to be critical of people who are organising donations and things like that. But I beg them to look at how they are doing it so that there can be the maximum benefit from the donation, not just for the farmers but for the whole community within which those farmers live. They are going to have to keep living in those communities after the drought has broken and they will have need of this infrastructure which, if we give donations in kind, donations of goods, is eroded. If groups feel they must give hampers, they should buy the hamper in the area that is being affected, so that again the money is circulating in that area. I cannot re-emphasise enough that it is important to help everybody in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coles in Bathurst is collecting non-perishables for distribution. I wonder what happens when this goes to small country towns and communities which do not have a Coles store&mdash;they may have one major chain in the area but they will have a small business person who runs a supermarket. Coles or Woolworths, or whoever is running this program, benefits because somebody in the community buys the goods to put in the box for the hamper. The local community does not benefit a great deal; some people get some goods that they may or may not want. The risk is run of closing down the small business, the small supermarket, in the small community town. When the drought is over, or even before the drought is over, people will be forced to travel 50, 60 or 100 kilometres, or 100 or 300 miles, to do their grocery shopping. Who benefits then? It is Coles and Woolworths, the majors, or whoever has run the program. It means that people have longer trips to buy their commodities, greater expense and such types of things. It is a little unfair and it needs people to think through very carefully just what the impact is going to be and how we can make sure that we maximise everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not want to be critical of those people who are making donations and those people who are organising for assistance to these areas, but I urge them to look very constructively and very carefully at how they can maximise the benefit of these donations. I would contend, and everybody I have spoken to would contend, that the best way of doing this is to provide financial assistance so that those people can spend the money as they need to. That way, people can spend the money and not rely on hampers, so that if they walk into a shop they are spending money like everybody else does&mdash;nobody needs to know where that money has come from, and they can do it with pride and with dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make sure that the shops&mdash;the infrastructure&mdash;in those towns remain. We also need to make sure that those people donating are aware that their donation is benefiting the maximum number of people in those communities. As I have said, the farmhand appeal now is targeting those who fall outside other criteria, such as those who are ineligible for assistance under the criteria for exceptional drought circumstances, so those people should be looking to get assistance. It is going to require consultation and cooperation on the part of many people and many groups, but it can be done and it should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the CPSU, the Community and Public Sector Union, is in the process of starting payroll donations from its members to go towards the farmhand appeal. I would suggest that if people want to maximise the amount of money they get out of the government they should make sure they give plenty to farmhand, because we have got a pledge to match this dollar for dollar. It is very important that people recognise this. They should keep making sure that they do donate, but donate in a way that is going to maximise the benefit to those people out there, to the whole of the community and not just to one member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that people in Canberra and people in Sydney are organising these donations. But I beg them, please look carefully at it. To the companies that I am told are involved in making large donations of pallet loads of goods, I say, consider that these goods may not be what people want. Not everybody would chose to have several tins of Milo. People may not want to have dog biscuits. Let the people that are in need decide what their needs are and do not let somebody from outside come in, make those decisions for them, and provide them with goods that they cannot use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the last time I spoke that ten tonnes of potatoes went to Bourke. What happened was that in a number of areas potatoes went rotten. They went rotten in the stores that were not selling them. Their turnover of potatoes dropped markedly, therefore the potatoes were stored for longer than they needed to be, and that caused a problem. Also, they were donated in bags that were quite significant in size, and people were not getting halfway through them when the potatoes were staying fresh. Where only a husband and wife or two or three people were eating potatoes, by the time they got towards the bottom of the bag they were again having rotten potatoes. That is a waste of a precious commodity. Nobody did it intentionally, and I am not being critical, but it highlights the need for people to be able to choose to get the commodities they need as they need them, in the size and type that they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I reiterate again and again&mdash;and I will continue to do so&mdash;that people making a donation should try to make sure that it is in cash. If somebody does build up a hamper, why not raffle it in the community for which money is being raised? Then the money can go to farmhand or any of the other charitable organisations and supporting organisations, so that the maximum benefit is obtained for all involved. This will have to happen and continue to happen, but that is the plea that I would make to everybody: make sure you get the maximum benefit for your dollar that is being expended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 October the coalition committee of inquiry into the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification held a public hearing in Canberra at which farming and mining industry association representatives discussed their concerns in relation to this convention. The purpose of the hearing was to allow for elaboration on submissions made to the coalition inquiry. There is no doubt that the full Senate inquiry which I sought earlier should have taken place, and I welcome the support of Senators Kemp and O'Chee in regard to the need for that Senate committee inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot now continue to ignore the calls for investigation of this convention. As the Senate is aware, I have pursued this issue for some time, and it is encouraging to note that the government has stated that it will now consult with representatives of industry and community groups prior to ratification of the convention. However, whether those consultations will be serious and meaningful is open to doubt, in the light of the contents of a leaked document written by First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Fisher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's attitude toward consultation was exposed only this morning in an article by Geoffrey Barker in the Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. The `leaked' document from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to which Mr Barker refers in his article, is a minute by First Assistant Secretary Fisher which reveals `an institutional view that is highly critical and dismissive' of farming and business groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minute reveals an arrogant and dictatorial attitude. The department believes that consultations are a waste of time, because the government knows what is best for business. It is interesting to note, among the grossly unfair criticisms that this minute makes of business, farming and mining groups, the criticism that these groups do not get their message across to the public and are sometimes being outdone by the conservationists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we sought to have a full Senate inquiry into this particular convention, the government refused, along with the Democrats and the Greens. Subsequently, as a Liberal and National Party coalition, we set up our own inquiry. When I asked some questions of Minister Faulkner which suggested that the government should defer signing of the UN Convention on Desertification as a result of the evidence that had been brought to our attention in submissions to our own inquiry, the minister responded that he did not give a damn about the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major purpose of the Senate inquiry that we had sought, and our own inquiry that substituted for that, was to give these community groups, including the business, mining and farming groups, the opportunity to get their message across and the opportunity for their concerns to be heard effectively. Yet the government, through one of its departmental officers, criticises these groups for not getting their message across. Of course those groups were not able to get their message across when one of the major opportunities that they are given to get their message across, Senate committees, was denied to them on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fisher's attitude is typically myopic of someone who has been cloistered in Canberra, away from the real world, for far too long. The government's abysmal record on consultation and negotiation on previous conventions is a view shared by many, including Mr Geoff Allen from the Allen Consulting Group. He is an expert in business and government relations, and he has stated that the economic interests of Australia have often been neglected in what has been a complacent attitude in the negotiation of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departmental attitude flies in the face of the government's stated intention to consult and it is almost certain that the government will proceed to ratification of this convention with only limited consultation. With the advice it is receiving from the department, it is no wonder that concerned business and farm groups regard the government's commitment to consultation to be merely token and not real. There is an opportunity and a real test for the government to make some genuine reform in this area. It is for this reason that I raise this issue, yet again, as a matter of public interest. In doing so, I seek leave to table the transcript of the coalition's public hearing proceedings for the benefit of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Several key issues arose at this public hearing. The point of raising them today is to further assist in a much needed educative process for the government and to encourage it to continue its somewhat hesitant first steps at accountability to the Australian public. The issues are: firstly, the government's intention to submit a voluntary national action plan; secondly, the treaty making process, and the need for consultation with the states along with broader community involvement, including greater transparency, parliamentary scrutiny and accountability; thirdly, the use of the executive prerogative and the non-exclusive nature of the external affairs power; fourthly, desertification, as a local or regional as opposed to a global issue; fifthly, north and south economic adjustments; and, sixthly, trade and unintended implications of treaty making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four representatives at the public hearing all stated unequivocally that they would oppose ratification of the desertification convention, should the government proceed with the submission of a new national action plan which goes beyond the tabling of existing landcare programs. Mr Robert Hadler, Assistant Director of the National Farmers Federation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government has been reluctant to indicate at this stage what its decision will be on a National Action Program, which raises our suspicions about their intentions and their motivations for not answering at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>This view was supported in similar terms by the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Australian Mining Industry Council. It was also supported by others in written submissions to the committee. It is of regret that the government has been so tardy in declaring its position when this issue is clearly of major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been keen to tell us that the National Farmers Federation participated in the negotiations on this convention, and indeed Mr Ian Booth was present during the negotiations. I think it is important that we know what these gentlemen said at the coalition's hearing. Mr Hadler stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point on Desertification is that it is a problem in Third World countries where they do not have the experience or the programs in place to stop the spread of deserts and in fact their land management practices and policies are facilitating the spread of deserts, whereas in Australia our programs and practices do not facilitate the spread of deserts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point about having National Action Programs under the Convention was to justify assistance from developed countries like Australia to Third World countries. Basically, developed countries like Australia and the United States did not want to give aid money to Third World countries to stop the spread of deserts unless those Third World countries had National Action Programs in place to demonstrate that the money wouldn't be wasted.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that's no such rationale for having a National Action Program in Australia. We're not receiving aid to stop spread of deserts in Australia so there is no need for a National Action Program in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Desertification as a local or regional versus global issue, and north-south economic adjustments are behind the claims of many, including scientists Thomas and Middleton in their book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Desertification: Exploding the Myth</EMPHASIS>, that the United Nations environment program had orchestrated a massive publicity campaign to create a global issue out of what by definition can only be a local or regional issue, to attract aid funding for developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested by one witness that there had been a trade-off on support for the climate change convention by developing countries for which greenhouse gas emissions, for example, have little relevance. The trade-off was that developed nations would support the developing nations' push for the desertification convention. Mr Geoff Farnell, of the Australian Mining Industry Council, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have some concerns in that the process of desertification is essentially a national issue, rather than a global issue. We have our own laws for land management in Australia so we're not sure what additional value an international convention will bring to Australia . . . We are led to believe that the genesis of this Convention is a trade-off between developed and developing countries . . . so we have concerns about the genesis and rationale behind the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say in relation to land degradation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is to us whether a Convention is the best way and most appropriate way of bringing about improvements to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Climate change is an international issue because emissions from one country can impinge upon another country, a la acid rain but you can ask yourself, what do we do in Australia in terms of land management that impacts negatively on other countries?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ian Booth, of the National Farmers Federation and delegate to the negotiating conferences, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was quite a heated debate on the Convention floor about whether [Desertification] was man-induced or whether it was climatic but everybody agreed in the end that there was a range of factors and I think essentially there is a recognition that desertification as an inevitable process, probably does not have a universally accepted scientific basis . . . the CSIRO no longer use the expression.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If desertification had been recognised as a truly global phenomenon, developed countries would have been subject to the obligation to lodge National Action Plans. The fact that not all countries were is a clear sign that it wasn't regarded as a global issue . . . the Convention is about assisting countries . . . eighty percent of the time spent on the Convention floor was about funding. It's all part of the North/South economic adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA>This was supported by Mr Fred Gulson from the New South Wales Farmers Association who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One can be very suspicious and say . . . this is one way for UNEP to get the funding which it could not get back in 1977 . . . it is also good business for the developing countries. They've lost a lot of their sources of aid . . . one could be cynical.</PARA>
<PARA>And further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The jury's out on . . . what the international community sees or what UNEP sees it needs to do or the underdeveloped countries need to do to secure aid given the rearrangement of world powers. But maybe to hang it on desertification is a little bit specious</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I think there's enough scientific evidence to at least run that argument.</PARA>
<PARA>The trade implications particularly of the climate change, Basel, biodiversity and desertification conventions were of significant concern to the witnesses at the coalition's hearing, specifically in the potential for misuse as barriers to trade. Mr Geoff Farnell stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in terms of Climate Change we are the most vulnerable country . . . and there are huge implications for our energy, transport and agricultural sectors, let alone regional Australia and domestic structural adjustment considerations.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Basel Convention, Mr Farnell stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia did not lobby hard and we did not look to building alliances with similar countries.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful. He says further:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not a typical European bloc OECD trading country. We're very different in terms of the people we trade with and the things we do trade in . . . With the Hazardous Wastes, with the proposed ban from OECD to non-OECD countries of trade in such materials, if you're in the OECD and you are only trading in the OECD then you are winning.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus Australia, which trades with Asian or other non-OECD countries, may not trade in those materials when the definition of what constitutes waste had not been determined at the time the Basel Convention was negotiated. In making a point that some treaties have direct implications for trade&mdash;for example, endangered species&mdash;Mr Hadler commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treaties, such as Climate Change and Biodiversity so far have not had direct provisions related to trade. However, they can and probably will be used by various nations as trade barriers. For example, we are concerned that various countries may use a lack of action on Climate Change as an excuse to apply a countervailing duty on Australian products overseas . . . that has already been raised in coal negotiations in Germany as an issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ian Booth went further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real fear is that the trade aspects&mdash;the trade weapon is seen as the first line of response by all of the Northern conservation movement.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to unintended implications, the main point is that international treaties when negotiated are deliberately vague to attract the largest number of signatories and to attract funds. Two very vague statements in the biodiversity convention identified restrictions on access to improved genetic stock for Australian agricultural developers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was also made that the raison d'etre of the climate change convention was the issue of climate change and potential for global warning and subsequent effects on plants and animals. However, the rationale now given is that the convention is designed to protect our trade vulnerability, specifically our trade in coal. The unintended implications, particularly combined with a lack of adequate consultation, can have quite disastrous effects. Robert Hadler stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been too pure, overly attentive, zealous, in trying to prove its international credentials without recognising its position in the world negotiating league and, in recent years, the Government has really put Australia into very difficult situations in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a critical indictment of this government's behaviour in relation to conventions which Australia has already ratified. It is obvious that not only must consultation be adequate, but it must also involve state governments and local community groups, not just peak industry or conservation groups. Trade and environmental matters, not just diplomacy, need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to determine how the convention might be implemented. It has an obligation to spell this out to the community at the earliest possible time. The Labor government has persistently refused to do this but I do not believe it can continue on this path. Meaningful consultation is overdue as is a reassessment of why Australia is committed to this convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to comment on the coalition inquiry into the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. This inquiry should have never occurred. In reality it should have been a full Senate inquiry with the resources of the Senate to properly investigate the impact of this particular convention on Australia, on our trade, on employment in this country and, indeed, on the effectiveness of such a convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is crisis of confidence in the treaty making activities of this government. There is no question that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has an enormous enthusiasm for international conventions, ILO conventions and UN conventions. These have been signed in increasing numbers during the last ten years and the Australian people know very little about the conventions under which Australia is now obligated. Australians want to know why we are entering into these conventions; is the process by which the conventions are entered into adequate; what are the results of these conventions; and, what impact will they have on Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has been under increasing pressure in the last 12 months to improve the consultation arrangements in relation to conventions. At a recent estimates hearing I asked Senator Evans whether it would not be appropriate for the parliament to have some role in relation to the international multilateral conventions that he was so busy signing up, and he said, `No way, Jose.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what he said, `No way, Jose.' Then I said in a sarcastic voice, `We can't have the people involved in this, can we?' Senator Evans replied, `Dead right.' As the debate has continued, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and Senator Evans have detected the concern which I had detected, and which my colleagues Senator Chapman and Senator O'Chee had detected, that the community is insisting on a greater involvement in the treaty signing activities of Senator Evans.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago Senator Evans issued a press release in which, after carrying out the usual bagging of his opponents, he conceded that there was a need for greater consultation and transparency. Among other things, the minister indicated that treaties would be laid on the table and the parliament before they are signed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the change from the `No way, Jose' position. Any improvement is some improvement, and I welcome the shift from that position. The issue that arises is: when will they be laid on the table; will they be laid on the table before an initial decision is undertaken to enter into serious negotiations; will they be laid on the table after a draft treaty has been prepared and, if so, for how long will they be laid on the table? It is simply not good enough for them to be brought in one week and signed the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition inquiry into desertification I suggested that we need to get a clearer indication from the government precisely what it means when it says that it is prepared to lay these treaties on the table. The Australian people want to know why these treaties are being entered into and want to have a proper inquiry as to the full impact of such treaties on Australia. That was one of the first issues which came up at the inquiry. I thought the comments by the representatives from the mining industry and farming industry were most helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, as I have said, a lack of confidence in the minister and the department about their willingness to consult, and to consult in an adequate fashion. My colleague Senator Chapman drew attention in his remarks to a press report this morning which, I agree with Senator Chapman, showed a degree of arrogance about the views of business and cast doubt on how effective the internal consultative arrangements are&mdash;let alone the external consultative arrangements, the public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are some members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who do not share the utopian internationalism of Senator Evans and some of his senior colleagues. There are those in the department who have a more realistic view of the world as it is, and the challenges which are likely to face Australia in the future. Nonetheless, I agree with Senator Chapman that the report of the leaked minute this morning was singularly disturbing. It will be very interesting to hear the comments of Senator Evans in relation to that particular minute, and the action that he proposes to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hearings that were undertaken by the coalition did not deal only with the convention on desertification. In fact, quite a number of other conventions and treaties came up in the discussion. I invite members of the public and, indeed, members of DFAT who are interested in such matters, to read very closely the views of the mining and farming industries. In relation to the climate change convention, for example, there was quite a degree of concern expressed in relation to that particular framework convention, particularly as we go towards next March when there will be major negotiations taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Chapman said, there were also concerns expressed about the impact of the biodiversity convention on this country and, indeed, the whole issue and the continuing problems that have occurred as a result of the mishandling of the Basel convention which was signed and ratified earlier this year. It is not only business that was concerned about the negotiations and the way that the whole Basel convention was signed. There was a leaked letter from the US Department of State which expressed the greatest concern for the way Mr Lamb chaired the final negotiations on these hearings. It felt that there was not sufficient debate about the impact that this convention would have. Again, we need a response from the minister, because it is those concerns which are building up in the community. I believe that in these hearings we enabled some of these views to be exposed and ventilated in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue which needs to be covered. It really is the issue of the way the government initially enters into these particular conventions and the way the conventions may ultimately have an impact on this country. Senator Chapman drew our attention, quite rightly, to some particular trade issues which may emerge. One way that conventions in the future can be enforced, or attempted to be enforced, is the use of the trade weapon. Again, the evidence that was given to the hearings on this particular matter was particularly instructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have drawn attention before to the extraordinary naivety of Senator Evans, and at least some members of his department, in the various report cards that they give to the United Nations. For example, there was a report card referred to in an estimates committee hearing&mdash;the ninth periodic report of the government of Australia to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. I have to say that a fair-minded person reading such a report card would think that Australia was one of the most racially intolerant, bigoted countries in this world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why an Australian government would file such a unbalanced report beggars belief, but unfortunately this is the attitude of this government to the UN. As Senator Chapman says, it seems to be overtly zealous and, indeed, quite naive about the impact that these reports can have. This issue of naivety came up in relation to the first report card that we gave on climate change, which was filed last month. This is what the evidence to the committee showed about the whole approach to filing this report card. I quote Mr Hadler of the International Farmers as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is a significant chance that because of the difficult position we have portrayed in our first report card to the United Nations on Climate Change responses in Australia, that we won't have much ability to negotiate a rational outcome in March next year. And we won't be in a position to develop sound strategic alliances to ensure that the science is properly weighed in developing political solutions to these problems.</PARA>
<PARA>This is astonishing. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's first national communication substantially overestimated the impact of agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions. There's no doubt about that and I think there's now recognition by officials that both the methodology and the data used in our first national communications substantially overestimated the size of the problems Australia is facing.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand&mdash;and there are rumours in the industry which I would like to see clarified&mdash;that the United Nations Secretariat has already come back and asked some questions of Australia in relation to this particular report card. What on earth is the advantage to an Australian government in filing a report to the United Nations which substantially overestimates the problems that we are experiencing in this very contentious area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already rumours around, and again these were reported in the press today, that in relation to coal exports to Germany our coalminers were faced with questions about Australia's performance under the climate change convention. It gives some credence to the point that Senator Chapman raised, that trade may well be used as a particular weapon in relation to these conventions. What is the advantage to this country in filing a report to the United Nations which portrays us in such a bad light? If this is the lack of national pride that the republicans wish to portray, I regard it as a very sad reflection on the current leadership of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Convention on Desertification, has brought quite a few issues to a head. The government has signed the convention, but now it says it will consult with business and the states before it ratifies the convention. My view is that the government will be placed in a difficult position, because it is now being asked by business&mdash;and, I am sure, by the states&mdash;to give a guarantee that it will not file a national action program. If it refuses to accede to these requests, the strong advice from business and, I suspect, ultimately from the states will be not to ratify this particular convention. It will be interesting to see, when the government is faced with this dilemma, just what road it is prepared to take. What substance do we give to the consultative arrangements that Senator Evans and Mr Lavarch flagged so recently? I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the government is about to undertake a major test in relation to its sincerity on the consultative arrangements with the states and with business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to revisit the issue of the superannuation losses suffered by 35 former McDonnell and East employees in Brisbane. In the last couple of weeks, there has been some media exposure on the issues I raised here on 19 October. However, we are still no closer to discovering who is responsible for the investment decisions which ultimately led to the substantial losses suffered by the superannuation fund members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Senate may recall that last time I raised this matter, I indicated that none of the parties involved had admitted any responsibility for the losses. I particularly mentioned the responses to media reports of the fund trustee, Permanent Trustee, and the fund manager, Peregrine Investments Management, formerly Northern Securities Management. We now have another denial to add to that record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> article on 23 October 1994 which reported the matters I raised here, Mr Maranta&mdash;a former director of the employer company and the fund manager controlling the superannuation fund&mdash;is reported in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> article of 30 October 1994 to also deny any responsibility. Mr Maranta claims that at the time the superannuation funding deficiency came to light he was no longer a director of either company. This may well be so but, as I indicated previously, the problems of the superannuation fund stem from investment decisions made in the period that Mr Maranta was a director on both boards, which includes the period June 1990 to November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is the question of why the fund manager transferred about $450,000 from secure investments to the high risk, unlisted property trusts sometime between June 1990 and June 1991. More to the point: what was Mr Maranta's involvement in that decision? It should be noted that not only was Mr Maranta chairman of directors of the fund manager Northern Securities but he was also the principal executive officer during that period. Therefore, he was running the company that ignored the indicative investment authority given by the employer and made the investment decision to increase investments in the Norsec property trusts by $450,000. Thus the exposure of the McDonnell and East workers' superannuation savings to these high risk investments was effectively increased to a whopping 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another decision relating to the superannuation fund's investment which is also somewhat puzzling. In June 1992, the employer, North Quay Ltd, supposedly gave a new investment authority which authorised the fund manager and trustee to invest 70 per cent of the funds in the Norsec property trusts. This new investment authority was given at a time of the property trust's rights issue. North Quay management claimed that it thought the authority was needed to take up a $250,000 investment in the rights issue, whereas the fund manager's response was that it was quite clearly a new investment authority. It should be noted that the fund manager initiated the new authority, not North Quay management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we be sure that the employer had really wanted to make the change at that time, rather than merely going along with the fund manager's suggestion? The most telling point here is that, if the superannuation fund's asset allocation had been in accordance with the original investment authority at the time of the rights issue offer, the fund would have been entitled to take up only some amount that would have been a small fraction of the $250,000 that was taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that had occurred, the superannuation fund would have avoided the substantial losses in the value of those property trust units in the following 12 months. This point demonstrates that several years down the track the superannuation fund's financial troubles can be traced back to that decision taken in the first year of the superannuation fund's operation, to substantially increase the fund's investment in Northern Securities property trusts. Again, who was responsible for that decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the article which reported Mr Maranta's denial of any fault it is clear that Mr Maranta is trying to distance himself from the superannuation fund's failure. So what was the extent of Mr Maranta's involvement and interest in the company which was fund manager of both Norsec superannuation fund and the property trust? The McDonnell and East workers' superannuation savings were held by the former, and most of the assets were invested in the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 accounts for Northern Securities show that payments to two directors for that year totalled $287,000. Payments in 1991 are shown as a total of only $40,000 for two directors. One of the directors received an amount between $130,000 and $140,000, and the other director received an amount between $150,000 and $160,000. As Mr Maranta was a director during this period, he would have received one of these amounts. Mr Maranta at that time also had substantial shareholdings in the company. With a combination of direct holdings and indirect holdings through private companies, Mr Maranta and his family effectively owned 30 per cent of Northern Securities. The accounts also show that, in both 1991 and 1992, Northern Securities paid $25,000 for a season box to the Broncos Rugby League Football Club. At that time Mr Maranta was also a director of the Broncos club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 accounts for the Norsec Property Trust disclose payments to Kingville Pty Ltd, in which Mr Maranta and another director, Greg Chappell, hold a third of the shares and a member of Mr Maranta's family holds another third. Kingville managed a number of the trust properties, for which it received fees of $110,000 in 1993 and $177,000 in 1992. A further fee of $132,000 was paid to Kingville in 1993 for work done on a proposed purchase that was later abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, Mr Maranta appears to have had extensive interests stemming from Northern Securities and the trusts managed by that company. He seems to have fared rather well from these interests. Although Mr Maranta said, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> article of 30 October, that his own superannuation was still locked up in Norsec, clearly he is not relying on that money as a major source of financial support as are many of the former McDonnell and East workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate my previous comment: if public confidence in superannuation is to be maintained, there should be swift remedies for superannuation members who have suffered losses such as in the McDonnell and East case. Unfortunately, the relevant authorities seem to be unable to help them and the only remedy they have available is to engage in costly court action. Most, if not all, of those individuals do not have the resources to take legal action against those who are responsible, whereas those who are responsible for the losses seem to have substantial resources at their disposal to defend any such action. This highlights the alarmingly inequitable position of all superannuation fund members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Is the minister aware of the reports that this year's Antarctic ozone hole equals the record dimensions of 1993? What action is the government taking to respond to this global catastrophe?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2739" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Antarctic ozone hole this year was of a similar size to the hole in 1993. Scientists project that it will continue to get bigger each year until around the turn of the century because it takes years for CFCs and other ozone depleting substances to reach the stratosphere where ozone depletion takes place. As chlorine levels drop in the stratosphere, eventually the ozone hole too will shrink.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news is that CSIRO scientists have announced that chlorine levels in the lower atmosphere will soon stabilise and then start to decline. This is ahead of earlier predictions, and it vindicates the prompt and effective action taken by the government and the 137 other countries that are signatories to the Montreal protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that we need to remain vigilant. I recently announced new controls on certain ozone depleting substances. A program agreed with industry will see the phase-out of HCFCs ahead of the Montreal protocol targets. HCFCs have proved valuable in assisting the phase-out of the much more destructive CFCs, but they also damage the ozone layer and it is time to start to phase them out also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will begin reducing the use of the pesticide methyl bromide, as it also makes a significant contribution to ozone depletion. The Environment Protection Agency will be working with agricultural and quarantine agencies to implement an information program to advise growers about alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give recognition to the cooperation that government has received from industry in relation to this matter. The rather intricate quota mechanisms and timetable for the phase-out have been put together with the assistance of industry. These allow industry the lead time that certainly it needs while allowing Australia to exceed the Montreal targets. Industry has also accepted the need for a user pays approach to administration of the phase-out, and a mechanism to do that has also been agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International controls will have substantial benefits, particularly for those countries in the Southern Hemisphere close to Antarctica. If we had failed to achieve effective international controls, the increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation into the next century would have had very serious health effects, including large increases in the incidence of skin cancer and some other diseases. It would also have done untold damage to agriculture and natural ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the Montreal protocol, its effectiveness and its immense value to Australia, and the fact that industry has accepted its responsibility and worked in close cooperation with the government, provide a real object lesson to those who are spouting mindless criticism of Australia's participation in international treaties. I think some people ought to take a very good look at the Montreal protocol to learn why Australia has so much to gain from an active participation in international attempts to address global environmental problems. Our highly regarded environmental expertise and high credibility when it comes to meeting our commitments allow Australia to play a very valuable role in developing international approaches that are not only in Australia's best interests, but are in our international best interests.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its great credit, it was this government that dismantled the two airlines agreement. Senator Macdonald's predecessors reinstated it. The fact is that the deregulation of the Australian aviation industry and the establishment of the International Air Services Commission, with the ability for airlines other than Qantas to service international markets, have produced an environment to the great benefit of the tourism industry&mdash;an industry with which the coalition has no credibility whatsoever as a result of the extraordinary statements made by those opposite over the years about aviation policy&mdash;and has provided Australian consumers with unprecedented prices on tickets and unprecedented packages that they have never previously enjoyed in this country. That has been reflected not only in the growing numbers of Australians who are flying in this country&mdash;numbers which are growing in exponential bounds with every year&mdash;but also in a huge increase in the tourist industry generally in Australia, which has resulted from additional international flights to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. Senator Collins has always been incapable of any logic or counting. I will just explain to him that there are Qantas and Ansett&mdash;two airlines. There was a third airline which would have provided competition on domestic routes, and that was Air New Zealand. A couple of weeks ago this government effectively stopped Air New Zealand flying domestically within Australia. In view of what Senator Collins has said, why has the government done that, when it acknowledges the benefit of a third airline? In walking away from that agreement with Air New Zealand, how can the government expect any country to ever again trust this government's signature on any bilateral agreement? Senator Collins will be aware that it has been reported in the press that Air New Zealand had spent over $400 million in getting ready to set up here. What does the Minister have to say to that?

Maybe then they could advocate New Zealand's interests instead of Australia's. These are the cold hard facts: Air New Zealand has received tremendous opportunities in Australia, but in negotiating with the New Zealand government&mdash;as with any other country around the world&mdash;the only sensible measure that has to be applied by this government, and has been applied, is reciprocal benefits for both countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. The Australian government attaches great significance to federal and state governments and the business sector working together to maximise Australia's export performance. To further this important objective, earlier this year the minister announced plans to establish an Australian business centre in Tokyo. Can the minister please advise the Senate on progress in establishing this centre and the significance this initiative is likely to have on Australia's export performance in Japan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be dealing with a question from someone who is pursuing Australia's interests instead of those of some other country. The matter to which Senator Neal has referred&mdash;and which she and I have discussed previously; and I thank her for her interest in it&mdash;is a very good example of team Australia in action. I refer to the Commonwealth, the states and the public and private sectors working together to advance the collective interests of Australia&mdash;not some other country&mdash;and cooperating in advancing the trade, tourism and business interests of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Neal pointed out, during July we had the opportunity to announce and to witness an agreement between Austrade, the Tourist Commission, various state government agencies and some private sector industry bodies and businesses to establish an Australian business centre for the first time in Tokyo. We have just had the opportunity formally to approve the formation of a business association to conduct that centre, which will be an important focus for Australian economic activities there and which should become fully operational in the first half of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre will have a range of Australian government agencies&mdash;particularly Austrade and the Tourist Commission&mdash;and representatives of several state governments, state tourist agencies, private sector companies and bodies such as Ansett Airlines, the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian and New Zealand chambers of commerce in Japan. I want to point out that this does not mean we will be taking Austrade out of the Australian embassy; it will continue to have a significant involvement there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Neal also asked what advantage this will have for Australian business in the region. It will be substantial. It will increase awareness of Australia's capacity to supply quality exports and it will increase the awareness of Australia as an attractive destination for tourism and investment. There will be significant benefit&mdash;although it is not directly in my portfolio&mdash;from the co-location of our tourism agencies. The cooperative approach that has been under way in that industry will be significantly enhanced by this co-location, and I think more of it would be welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a not dissimilar initiative under way in Australia House in London. There is no room in the building at this stage for a private sector representation, but various states and the Commonwealth will be coming together to turn that into a more effective centre for the representation of Australian interests, rather than the Commonwealth and the states being dispersed, which is neither economic nor efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre should also provide better access for Australian business visitors to Tokyo. It will give them a focal point to which they can go and get government and private sector assistance. For people dealing with Japanese buyers, tourists and investors, it will be a better location and a more coordinated environment. The location has been carefully chosen to give for the first time an official Australian representation in the commercial sector of Tokyo&mdash;central for business and convenient for people doing business there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The united presence in trade, tourism and promotion that this will provide in Japan is significant, given that it is our most important market for exports and tourists. It is a very important joint initiative involving the Australian government and business. It is an initiative at the right time and in the right place. I welcome it and I congratulate those involved from the embassy, Austrade, the state governments, whose cooperation we appreciate, and the private sector in making this venture successful.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The process in relation to seagrass baseline studies at Oyster Point is this. In relation to Senator Woodley's question on seagrass being of specific World Heritage value, I can confirm that the 1980 document nominating the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage area described the significance of seagrass and also marine life that was dependent on that seagrass&mdash;that, of course, included dugongs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I did that is as follows. Many organisations that have discussions with us about air safety, given an opportunity to complain about it, do not do so and then say something else as soon as they get out of the room. That was a perfect opportunity, with everyone in the same room together, to assess whether the CAA was implementing Captain Terrell's recommendations and they pronounced themselves satisfied with the result of that implementation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the industry section of the Working Nation statement we announced the intention of the government to establish Ausindustry as a one-stop or first stop shop for Australian business to access business programs and business supports delivered by the Commonwealth government, irrespective of the department from which those programs came. In other words, it sought to do away with the approach of having separate departments deliver a part of a service and other departments deliver another service and expecting the small- to medium-sized companies in Australia, the main target for business support programs, to be able to navigate their way through all of the programs available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have brought these people together under the one heading of Ausindustry, and it stands as a domestic reflection of the highly successful Austrade that has worked so well for Australian companies in representing their interests overseas and in providing market intelligence in foreign markets back into Australia so that  Australian companies can make market choices to capture competitive advantage where it sits for Australian companies in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ausindustry is in the process of being finally established. It has a private sector board. The chairman of that private sector board is Mr Richard Warburton, a chief executive of Dupont Australia and a distinguished Australian business person. The private sector board, working with the various government departments, looks at how best to deliver those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is as far as we have got at the federal level. But, as everyone who deals with government in Australia knows, there are three tiers of government in this country and, in order to provide a comprehensive delivery of service, we have conducted discussions with the state governments to see if we can find a basis for all government services aimed at enhancing business competitiveness and supporting Australian companies in the international marketplace and to grow in Australia so that we can find one way of delivering all of those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meeting of ministers of all states and territories of Australia was held in Perth on 28 October. We have signed a memorandum of understanding between the industry ministers of the states and territories of Australia and myself as federal industry minister to work, through Ausindustry, to deliver a comprehensive suite of all services to Australian business. I think in terms of federal-state relations that is a breakthrough, and I commend my colleague ministers at state and territory level for their far-sighted, cooperative approach in getting this package of goods together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing this we have focused on the client. We have asked: who is the client of government services? In the industry area the client predominantly and overwhelmingly is small- to medium-sized business in this country. As government suppliers of services to those businesses, we have concentrated on focusing on their needs and simplifying the delivery of the services and supports we have to make it easy for them to access the whole suite of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the new year, when we will complete the bilateral negotiations to focus on the particular state delivery mechanisms with each of the states and territories, we will announce and open Ausindustry for business. It means that business people approaching Ausindustry, either by phone or directly through the door, will be greeted by a case manager who will help them cocktail the various services that are available, federal or state, in order to get the best representation of services and supports for them. That is how the Australian government sees the best way of ensuring increasing competitiveness, growth in the business sector of Australia and the winning of a major share of this in the international market.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Five states have signed that agreement and proceeded to establish the child-care places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opposition yesterday wanted to say that we were not doing enough for child care.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is worse than that for New South Wales because it actually signed the first strategy in 1988; but, unlike all the other states, it has not even honoured its half of that strategy. So child care in New South Wales is 780 places behind when it could well be that far ahead and, if it had participated in the second signing of the strategy, could be much further ahead.

Since 1992, there has been an agreement with the New South Wales government to establish a child-care centre in Hurstville. The plans had been approved by council and funding was ready to go. The New South Wales Department of Education, which was supplying the land, decided to increase the cost of the lease.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ferguson this day, relating to redundancies at the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that the opening paragraph of my question was a fairly simple request, and I think it really indicates the interest that this current minister has in what is actually happening in CSIRO at present. A letter was written to him or to his office after a meeting of the board on 18 October this year. By a further answer after question time he indicated that one of his staff had returned that letter to the CSIRO to get more information. I would have thought that the minister would have at least sighted the letter so that he would have had some idea of the request, clarification or advice that he was being asked for. He could have had at least some idea or input. I am just quite staggered that he is not aware of what is going on in CSIRO at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister in his answer to me today said, `Why should I know when CSIRO is just one line in the appropriations?' One of the reasons that these questions need to be asked is that the minister was responsible for delivering a $60 million shortfall over the triennium. That $60 million shortfall is one line in the budget. That is one of the reasons why there are redundancies in the CSIRO today. The minister cannot cut $60 million from a budget and then wipe his hands of any responsibility for a program of redundancies. If the minister did not have anything before him in the form that I outlined in the question, then I think the least he could do would be to present the Senate with the information that he does have because these questions have been asked for a great period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions were first raised during estimates back in May and June, when certain indications were given to us by both the minister and Dr Stocker as to what this redundancy program would be. The minister, in his response to me, asked, `Why one institute? Why do you single out one institute&mdash;the Institute of Animal Production and Processing?' One of the reasons that that institute has been singled out relates to the 200 redundancies that we were told back in May and June would occur. Dr Stocker told us in evidence that the figure could be up to 200. Of those 200 redundancies, 138 will be from the one institute, the Institute of Animal Production and Processing. That, I would have thought, was a disproportionate number of staff to be taken from one institute as part of the ongoing program that we heard about it in detail during estimates in June and which we have heard some more about over the past couple of months as we have been conducting the Senate inquiry. That is the reason why we are referring to the one institute. In confirmation of that, on 23 June Dr Stocker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can give you more accurate figures. The reduction in positions, according to Dr Donald's figures for the Institute of Animal Production and Processing, would be from the present number of 1,554 to 1,416 over the three years, only three of which would be research staff.</PARA>
<PARA>All I asked of the minister was specifically whether he could reaffirm that statement, because we have heard nothing in any evidence we might have taken since to suggest there will be only three. There seems to be general concern amongst many people who have given evidence to us that the figure is likely to be more than three. That is of particular concern. One of the concerns is that this program is being carried out prior to the Senate inquiry having the opportunity to report to this parliament, which we intend to do by the last day of the sittings. It also flies in the face of another comment by the minister. On 26 May, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that most of any staff change in CSIRO will occur by natural effluxion of attrition rather than by any particular program of targeted redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA>So I think the minister has a responsibility at least to let us know how well he is informed of what is going on in CSIRO. Also, for the sake of the people employed by CSIRO, there needs to be some certainty for them. All I was specifically asking for was a reaffirmation of the remarks made during estimates last June. The minister failed to reaffirm Dr Stocker's statement about the number of redundancies and just how many of those people would be research staff. </PARA>

That is the responsibility of the chief executive, the board, the directors and the other management streams of the CSIRO. They make the decisions with regard to the employment of people within that organisation. That is exactly how it should be and, indeed, that is exactly what those opposite wanted it to be. So do not come in here raising a question with regard to the minister's role when his role is exactly as it should be. He has no responsibility to reaffirm anything that the chief executive has said. That was said to us during the course of the inquiry. The chief executive also informed us, along with the directors of the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and the Institute of Plant Production and Processing, that there had been a seven per cent increase in funding for rural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some people on the other side would like to contradict that, and that is their right and their prerogative.

The government has done that despite the evidence that has been presented to this committee regarding the enormous benefit to cost ratio that is returned from funds devoted to rural research. The other important issue in relation to the provision of government appropriation funds to rural research is the large amount of public good that comes out of rural research as against individual private good. That is another very important issue. There is a higher level of private good involved in research in the manufacturing information technology sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important factor with regard to rural research is that a lot of Australian rural industry requires research to be undertaken that is unique to Australia.

The fact that the inquiry that was thrust upon the Senate had no real merit at the time in terms of priority&mdash;the committee could have been doing more important work&mdash;did not in any way suggest to me that Senator Murphy and I, as members of that committee, should not apply ourselves to the job at hand and try to have a balanced and objective view on the information and evidence presented to us.

It was not until later that the areas of mining, the production of electric energy and other forms of energy, and manufacturing came onto the scene. I, among others, argued that more facilities should be going to research in the manufacturing area. But at no stage have I considered&mdash;and I certainly have not publicly uttered any suggestion&mdash;that rural research was not still very important. Adequate funds should be allocated to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy has already indicted that there was an increase in the budget bottom line of $28 million. That cannot be refuted. If there has been a reduction in the amount of money available to the CSIRO, obviously we have to look at the 30 per cent in respect of which people are being required to go out and get money for particular projects. Also, money has been put into the CSIRO by grower organisations in areas such as beef and wool to carry out particular projects&mdash;which it has done very well. </PARA>

But it is difficult to determine how much of a research project goes to the private good and how much to the public good. Surely, the fact that there is substantial public good is sufficient reason for public contribution. We should try to maintain the budget of the CSIRO as much as possible. </PARA>

We all want the CSIRO to continue to be viewed by the community in a good light and to become an even better and more efficient organisation. As a government, we have been striving mightily to do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The perception of the public is that it is not, and it is the government's fault. On 24 October the Minister for Transport wrote to his New Zealand counterpart repudiating the Australia-New Zealand memorandum of understanding on aviation services&mdash;a memorandum that was signed by Senator Collins himself on 1 August 1992 in Darwin. It followed a great trumpeting of a change in policy that came out in the One Nation statement and was then supported by Senator Collins in his policy document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian aviation: towards the 21st century</EMPHASIS>. In that document he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think Senator Burns should listen very carefully to this; so should Senator Collins, because his signature is on it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Quite correctly, that was a move to break down the duopoly that had existed in Australia for many years. Over the last two weeks the government has put forward a series of explanations as to its actions in repudiating the memorandum of understanding signed by Senator Collins. I might say that the reasons given do not hold water, and everyone in the industry recognises that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter that Mr Brereton sent to his New Zealand counterpart argued that New Zealand had not fulfilled its commitments to implement appropriate passenger facilitation arrangements.

At about the same time Mr Brereton was dialling 0011 on his fax machine, New Zealand Customs told the Australian Customs Service it was ready to proceed with a trial of the new system&mdash;No. 1 excuse down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said in his letter that the consultations relating to the ownership and control of Australian and New Zealand airlines had been `attenuated and inconclusive'. We have heard from Senator Gareth Evans a great deal about the consultations required under the memorandum. The fact is, however&mdash;Senator Collins would know this, and I will be interested to hear his remarks on this when he gets up to speak&mdash;that that particular clause on ownership and control was proposed by New Zealand, and it was proposed to try to ensure that the New Zealand air operator, Air New Zealand, would not be taken over by a predator from a third country.

Analysts are not stupid. They will simply discount the value of Qantas shares on offer to take into account the effects of the MOU agreement when it comes into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also said that a single aviation market would create uncertainty in the minds of Qantas investors. What could create more uncertainty than what we have seen over the past few weeks? Back in 1992 Senator Collins stated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian aviation: towards the 21st century</EMPHASIS>&mdash;his policy, which I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The announced changes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including, I suppose, the single aviation market&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will facilitate the privatisation process for Australian Airlines and Qantas by reducing uncertainty and removing the barrier between international and domestic aviation.</PARA>
<PARA>That was government policy two years ago. Where are we now? And Senator Collins was right: investors do deal with market-related certainty all the time. What investors do not like dealing with is sovereign risk. By repudiating the memorandum of understanding, the government is increasing the uncertainty associated with the float&mdash;not reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has asserted that the memorandum was one-sided. The Prime Minister has said, `In Australia's terms it's been all give, give, give and New Zealand all take.' If the memorandum is so one-sided, why did Senator Collins sign it in the first place? Why did he stupidly sign it in the first place if the Prime Minister is now saying it was all one-sided? Did the minister, for instance, seek the advice of his department about the effects of signing that agreement? I would be interested to know whether he did that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to repudiate the agreement has thrown doubts on the credibility of an agreement with this government. So why has the government abandoned the single aviation market, whether temporarily or permanently? Who knows? Maybe Senator Collins will tell us when he gets to his feet. The reason is that it is drifting backwards in policy terms towards the duopolistic aviation system that his government was so critical of in the past. It is to the disadvantage, I might say, of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does this minister and this government have any interest in lower income earners? Have they any interest in the general public? Of course they do not. They have stood up here time and time again every time we have raised this issue and criticised us, claiming that somehow we represent some lobby group for Air New Zealand. We are representing the ordinary Australians because they are the ones who will benefit from more competition within the market in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's One Nation policy built on its initial deregulation of the domestic airline market which took place in 1990. When Senator Gareth Evans first announced the termination of the two-airline agreement, he rejected the concept of an open skies policy. He said there was no rational solution short of designating a single carrier to service Australia and New Zealand's overseas markets, inspired, presumably, by the ALP's continued fascination with Sweden. He cited Scandinavian Airlines, SAS, as a model. That airline is still making a loss, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now gone back to that position with Mr Brereton repudiating the MOU and the Prime Minister's advocacy of a shotgun marriage between Air New Zealand and Ansett. What happened last Thursday? Once again the Prime Minister was talking about Scandinavian Airlines. That is what Senator Gareth Evans was talking about in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failures of Compass 1 and Compass 2 have demonstrated that there are very high barriers to entry into the Australian domestic airline market. Air New Zealand is probably the only credible competitor to the two incumbents. Its mere existence&mdash;even though it may not have gone into the domestic market, and a lot of people suspect it would not&mdash;as a potential entrant is in fact a powerful force in favour of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's `two-airline aviation policy'&mdash;and they are the words Senator Gareth Evans used on Monday&mdash;will, over time, increase airfares and considerably disadvantage the travelling public. That is what we are interested in. We are the ones who are pro-Australian; we in the coalition are pro-Australian. We in the coalition are the ones who want to promote competition within the airline industry; not the government. We are the ones who are supporting the domestic and inbound tourist industry; not the government. The Labor Party is supporting the airlines at the expense of ordinary Australians. That is what it talked about a couple of years ago, but it has now gone back on that as well. What have we heard from Mr Lee on tourism? Nothing: he has been strangely silent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the government's aviation policy is incoherent. Senator Collins mishandled the portfolio, but the incumbent minister, Mr Brereton, is even worse. He has grossly mismanaged aviation safety; he has clumsily backed out of an important bilateral arrangement which has cast doubt on our international credibility, and he and the Prime Minister are presiding over a significant reversal in aviation policies, a reversal that will cost Australians dearly. The minister has been described in the media as a decisive minister. He must act decisively now and resign before he does any more damage to the aviation industry in Australia. </PARA>

They like to negotiate open skies policies for their carriers everywhere else around the world but, when we try to put our carriers into their air space, when we try to negotiate additional seats their way with Australian carriers, for example, see how far we get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply a policy from a coalition that has had no experience in implementing any of these policies for a very long time. That is the reality of it. It is an incredible aviation policy, and we do not intend to adopt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only two planks to the coalition's policy: firstly, open skies&mdash;that is, giving away Australia's rights, and we would be the only country in the world that would do it; and, secondly, a policy on full cost recovery for safety regulation. They are the two planks. They are all that those opposite have managed to scrape together in 10 years of opposition&mdash;open skies and full cost recovery for safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to correct a point that Senator MacGibbon made when he waved around a newspaper article on safety regulation and cost recovery. Senator MacGibbon has kindly confirmed that the article that he was waving around was the Tom Burton article which referred to me and Minister Beazley. It said that I was `happy' about the cabinet's decision to go for full cost recovery&mdash;and that is still coalition policy. That is what the article said. As was pointed out to the journalist by a member of my staff at my request, and it is on the public record, that is profoundly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now a matter of public record that the ERC took a decision for full cost recovery some years ago, and I might add that that original decision included full cost recovery for search and rescue. Far from being happy about it, I was in fact profoundly unhappy about it, as the public record testifies. I went back to cabinet&mdash;although I was not then a cabinet minister, but I went into cabinet&mdash;and had the decision on cost recovery for search and rescue immediately reversed. A decision was made by cabinet that the implementation of full cost recovery would be deferred for a full year, which it was, and I then discussed the matter with my colleagues in that intervening year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, cabinet took a decision to rescind the original arrangement and only recover 50 per cent of the cost. As a result of a submission from Minister Brereton&mdash;which I strongly supported&mdash;cabinet identified the true public interest component of air safety regulations and added additional public finance to the original 50 per cent, and that is now taken from the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I raise that? The coalition is telling us about a credible aviation policy, but what did it do in response? The coalition went to the last election and not only asserted full cost recovery for safety regulation, but said it would abandon the traditional arrangements that we were going to put into place, and immediately move for full cost recovery&mdash;which would have crippled the light aircraft sector in this country&mdash;and boasted about the fact that by doing so the coalition would save $20 million in public money. It is in Fightback. Those opposite should look it up. In fact, it is the only reference to aviation in the document that the opposition took to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has only two credible aviation policies. The first one is open skies&mdash;and we are certainly not going to adopt that; it would be totally contrary to Australia's interests. The second one is full cost recovery for safety regulation. We are not going to adopt that, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as Air New Zealand and competitiveness is concerned, Senator Parer should do his job as shadow minister. He should open his eyes instead of acting as a lobbyist for Air New Zealand. He should look at the facts. As I pointed out to the Senate, we are still committed to the single aviation market, and that market has substantially progressed over the last two years. I am very pleased that it has worked as well as it has. Yesterday, I pointed out to the Senate that this month&mdash;and it is only nine days old&mdash;Air New Zealand was granted an additional 3,600 seats out of Australia in direct competition with Ansett and Qantas. From 1 November, Air New Zealand has been permitted to operate 12 services a week, totalling 3,600 seats, in direct competition with Ansett and Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very significant amount of competition. What has been the result of that competition? I will match our aviation policy, in terms of success, against any other. I will tell Senator Parer the results of our policies on aviation. These deregulation policies were brought in in 1990, and in the four short years since then there has been an increase of 58 per cent in the number of passengers flying on the 21 top routes in Australia. I will say that again: since 1990, as a direct result of these policy changes, there has been an increase of almost 60 per cent in Australians flying over the top 21 routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer talks about looking after consumers, but what has happened in terms of prices? Over the same period that the traffic has increased as a result of the policy changes, airfares have dropped in real terms by 22 per cent. Credible organisations such as the Bureau of Transport Economics have examined these policy changes and we are told that they have resulted in a contribution of $100 million directly to the flying public of Australia. I might add that the examination resulted in a big tick for the policies. The policies are working extremely well. I will say it again. We have a 60 per cent increase&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every Australian citizen owes more money than the citizen of any other country in the world, thanks to the policies pursued by Senator Collins and people like Senator Burns. They have a flare for mismanagement, though that is not a narrow flare. It is a broad flare, and it spreads right across all the departments they touch. Aviation is a classic example of their inability to handle any policy development that requires a bit of skill and thought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mess they are in at the present time does not start with Senator Collins, however major a contribution he might have made to it. It starts back in the Whitlam era, when the legendary&mdash;or notorious&mdash;Charlie Jones was for many years the first Labor minister for civil aviation. It is very hard to find someone with less intellectual ability than Charlie Jones, but in many ways Charlie Jones started it all. Then he became minister for transport. In those days, when Mr Jones took over aviation, we had a body, the Department of Civil Aviation, which was highly and universally respected in the aviation community. It might not have been loved by all, but it was an efficient body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly change had to take place. I was one of the people who talked about the need for change. But the change we needed had to be intelligent, reasoned and productive. What do we have under Labor? First of all, we had the bombastic Mr Beazley&mdash;all PR and blondes in attractive dresses running around as a substitute for policy. No substance at all to Beazley. Then Mr Morris came in. He equalled Mr Jones for intellectual ability. Then we had Senator Gareth Evans, who was just a messenger boy for Sir Peter Abeles&mdash;doing whatever Ansett wanted while he was the minister for transport. Then we had the redoubtable Senator Collins. While Senator Collins certainly was not a messenger boy for anyone, he did not have any policies either. Then we had Senator Cook, who left the department knowing less than when he came in. Finally, we have Mr Brereton, who is just a fixer&mdash;a machine man for the ALP Right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through all of this we have not had any coherent policy from the ALP. All we have had is glib trendiness from the great Australian trendy&mdash;Mr Keating. Mr Keating, the world's greatest Treasurer through the 1980s, was the archdisciple of the flat-earth policy&mdash;the economic rationalist guru. We had all this nonsense about user pays. As Senator Collins avers, I was always opposed to user pays and I am more opposed today than I was then, because it is grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the belief in the Labor Party that aviation was a preserve of the idle rich and that, if people could fly from Sydney to Melbourne, they deserved to be slugged. The Labor Party never saw that aviation was an essential part of the Australian economy. I always opposed that user-pay document because it denied the public interest responsibility of the government. It is not the person who is flying in the airliner who is at risk solely; it is also the people in the community underneath the flight of that aeroplane or where it might go. As importantly, there is the great contribution that aviation makes to the Australian economy. We have had Senator Collins boasting about the growth of the tourism industry. The tourism industry in Australia depends fundamentally on safe and efficient air travel. This is the reason why the government has to meet its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have had no policy guidance from the government. The only guidance the government has given the Civil Aviation Authority and the FAC is, `Make money out of aviation. Nothing else; just make money.' It is quite oblivious of the fact that all other forms of transport in Australia do not operate in the same way. The railways lose hundreds, if not billions, of dollars a year. No-one minds; the government pays for that. There are trains running empty. No-one minds that accumulatively we lose billions of dollars on buses providing public transport in the capital cities of Australia. No-one raises the user-pay concept. Why? I do not know. But then I cannot fathom the workings of what passes as a mind in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knew that things were wrong. It knew, when the independent inquiry into the TAAATS contract came up, that the Civil Aviation Authority was not working efficiently. Of course, the public knew more than 24 months before that, when we had the pilots strike in the late part of 1989 and 1990, when the Civil Aviation Authority and BASI operated as instruments of the government. We had the extraordinary position, which was proved in evidence taken in a Senate inquiry, of the general manager of Ansett ringing up at 10.30 at night and instructing officers of the Civil Aviation Authority to issue licences to foreign pilots to validate them to fly air routes in your own state, Mr Deputy President&mdash;an absolutely scandalous interference and abuse of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the degradation both in the operations and in the professional skill of the Civil Aviation Authority to the state it is at today. At no stage has the government acted to give any guidance. At the time of the Macphee report, after the fight I led about the TAAATS contract, a large number in the ministry wanted to fire the entire board of the Civil Aviation Authority. The majority, though, went to water and the board stayed on. Most of them have left since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the government fires the board, from Mr Gration down to the newest member, and puts people in who have operational competence and who know currently what goes on in Australian aviation, the government will not get anywhere with its aviation policies. But the government has to think about it. It has to decide what it wants to do. I will tell the government what it has to do. The government has to be in a position to provide safe air travel for Australian traffic and international traffic coming to this country. There is not an assurance of that at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing the government has to do is introduce policies which are efficient.

That was rejected by the people of Australia, thank goodness. That would have increased fares permanently, as far as airlines were concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of the Australian Labor Party in government. Who introduced real competition into airlines way back in the 1940s? It was the Chifley government, when it established TAA to compete against ANA. That airline, and subsequently Australian Airlines, had an excellent safety record. Over the years, we had the two-airline policy. No government seemed to think it was a good idea to get rid of it but, as a result of a change of heart within the ranks of the Labor Party, particularly by ministers in the cabinet, we had a situation where the aviation industry was deregulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember coalition members talking about deregulation for years and years. They said, `Let's deregulate the banking industry. Let's deregulate the airline industry.' Did they ever do it?  No, they never had the guts to do it. They never had the fortitude to do it. But the Labor government did it. From my point of view, though I was in disagreement with such a policy, it challenged the airline industry to show that, as a result of cheaper fares, there could be an improved result for people who used the airlines. That was going to mean more airlines involved in Australia and more competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compass tried to compete twice. I said at the time, `I've never owned a share in my life and I'm not going to start by buying shares in Compass.' That was the right decision. Twice it went down the drain because both the operating airlines had the capacity to reduce fares in a way that Compass could not compete with, and Compass was destroyed. Perfectly good investment capital went down the drain. It showed clearly, as many other occasions have shown, that competition can be useful. It can create a situation where people strive for excellence and compete on the basis of the result of that excellence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be terribly destructive, too. The lives of people who have invested money are destroyed when a perfectly good company which operates ethically and to the best of its ability loses everything and is destroyed as a</PARA>
<PARA>result of unfair and unbridled competition which is in no way hindered by sensible deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment was made about a reduction in fares. I have been reading in the press in the last few days about the very low fares between the capital cities in Australia as a result of competition between the current two airlines. I have some doubt that the fares could be any lower if Air New Zealand or other airlines were flying internally. If fares were lower, it would be for a very brief time only and it would be very destructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comment made by Senator MacGibbon about phone calls made in the night and airline pilots from overseas being licensed. Did Senator MacGibbon want the strike to succeed? Did he want those standover pilots who went on strike and held the community to ransom to succeed? As a government, we very intelligently used the capacity to introduce airline pilots into this country to serve the community well. Some of those pilots are still operating and are useful members of the airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon wanted the strike to succeed; that is what he just said and what he meant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It surprises me that, out of all the people on the Labor side of parliament in the House of Representatives and in here, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and Mr Hawke before him, cannot seem to find just one person who can do a decent job as the Minister for Transport. As senators MacGibbon and Parer said, we have had a series of ministers who have been the most incompetent in the whole of the parliament. Since I have been in parliament, we have had as our Minister for Transport Senator Collins, Senator Cook before him and Mr Brereton now. They continue the line of incompetent ministers who always seem to end up in this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Collins's time as minister, he was in charge of a lot of the regulation when the CAA was trying to establish an aviation policy. What did we have in Senator Collins's time? Inquiry and report after inquiry and report. It went on and on. In December 1988, we had the review task force. We then had the second review task force, the Senate inquiry into the CAA, the Ratner report, the Lawry report, the Yates report, the Beale report, the Macphee TAAATS inquiry, the Terrell report, the Sypher Meuller report, the BASI report into Monarch, a coronial inquest into the Monarch disaster, the preliminary coronial inquiry into Seaview, a judicial inquiry into Seaview, a police inquiry into the CAA and Seaview and a parliamentary inquiry into air safety. There have been 15 major inquiries and reports since 1988, and not a thing has been done by this incompetent government and its incompetent ministers. Senator MacGibbon pointed out 16 appointments of 11 different transport ministers in the last 10 years. It is no wonder there is no coherent aviation policy or any other sort of transport policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Mr Brereton has obviously shown his incompetence in recent days and weeks, Senator Collins shares much of the blame for the terrible trouble that Australian aviation is in at the moment. My colleagues and I have been overwhelmed over the last few years with complaints, reports, leaks and secret letters about Senator Collins's complete arrogance and inability to understand what aviation policy and safety should be all about. Senator MacGibbon quoted from an article in question time. I have to repeat it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the Government was in full notice that the system was not working, with both Collins and Cook and then Collins again last year being told by numerous delegations that safety in the commuter sector was being seriously compromised by the CAA's ineptitude.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the time Senator Collins was in charge when these complaints were raised in estimates committees and elsewhere, he defended the CAA by saying that it was doing a marvellous job and its safety record was next to none. All of that time, the sorts of problems that have surfaced in recent weeks were happening. Senator Collins, with his arrogant way of dealing with the people who complain to him, compounded the tragedy which has occurred in our skies with aviation safety in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate so far, Senator Collins has gone on at some length about the Air New Zealand matter. I want to briefly join with my colleagues in mentioning that. No-one would take much notice of what Senator Collins has said. Mr Acting Deputy President, you might recall that he lied to me in estimates committees. It was shown in the chamber from questions that were asked that he had altered the minutes of a CAA board meeting. That is all on the record. I do not need to repeat that. This government, this minister and the previous minister have no real idea of what should be done with aviation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has been talking about the great steps forward in tourism and aviation in recent times. During question time today, he accused us of promoting Air New Zealand. He said that we should be in the New Zealand parliament. I suppose Senator Collins is aware that British Airways owns 25 per cent of Qantas. How is that for looking after the Australian people? Of course, 50 per cent of Ansett is owned by that great Australian Mr Murdoch, who I think is a citizen of the United States. Yet Senator Collins has the hide to accuse us of looking after a foreign airline by promoting the cheap air fares that Australians would get if Air New Zealand came into the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The records show the tremendous strides that occurred in passenger accessibility to airlines during Compass's ill-fated history. It just showed what can happen with competition. More and more Australians were able to travel internally at a cheaper rate. The statistics on the growth in passenger numbers in the years that Compass was around are legend. Unfortunately, I do not have time to put those statistics on the record, but enormous strides were made in passenger numbers when we had genuine competition. We were going to have that again with Air New Zealand being given permission to fly domestically but, just because the Labor Party's mates could not hack it, the rug was pulled out from under Air New Zealand and we are back to the old two-airline policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is the general intention of this bill that the ILC would not retain an interest in land by granting lessor interests, such as a lease, where the ILC has itself acquired a full interest.

<PARA>This amendment deals with the carrying on of land management activities with the agreement of holders of the land. It deals with proposed new section 191E(1)(c). This ensures that any land management activities in relation to the indigenous-held land is carried out under agreement with the holders of the land. The government has reflected this in 191E(1)(a), but I believe it has failed to carry it through to paragraph (c) of that. </PARA>

I believe this has been overlooked and I think it is a point that needs to be remedied. If I recall correctly, during the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I put a question to Mr Dillon on this point and he believed that (1)(a) covered it. I will turn to (1)(a) and point out where I think the defect is. What we have is perhaps a different situation in (a) as opposed to (c). The section is headed `Functions', and it comes under `Land Management Functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation'. Proposed new section 191E(1) states, in part:</PARA>

<PARA>So far, so good. There is nothing wrong with that. But then in (c) it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenous-held land.</PARA>
<PARA>I see a contradiction, because (a) is saying that the ILC carries on land management activities under agreements with the holders of the land, but then under (c) it can carry on other activities without the agreement of the land-holders.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to Senator Ellison in complete good faith that he reconsider whether he wants to proceed with this amendment, for reasons that I will now explain. It is a function of the very wide definition of `land management activities' which appears in proposed new subsection (5). If we look at land management activity without that definition, it does sound as though what we are talking about is essentially intrusive activities involving the management, in an ordinary sense of that word, on a particular piece of land. What Senator Ellison is saying is prima facie intuitively plausible in that context. But when we look at the definition of `land management activities', we see that, among other things, it contains over the page, on page 6 of the bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)disseminating information (whether on a commercial basis or otherwise) about:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">land management practices; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)environmental management practices relating to land.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of other things, such as providing training and providing environmental management services, which are more specific in character and which may or may not have relevance here, but certainly information. Contemplate a situation where the Indigenous Land Corporation, in the general exercise of its land management responsibilities in relation to indigenous-held lands, wants to disseminate information on land care to indigenous land-holders right across the country. To have to seek the agreement of all land-holders to that kind of aspect of a land management activity, bearing in mind that that is the sort of thing that is covered within the definition and that is the kind of thing that is intended, is in fact to impose a wholly unnecessary restriction. It is not the sort of thing that would be imposed on any other body with these sorts of functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that (c) is there in that form, in that kind of open-endedly expressed way. I think we can obviously rely on either the incapacity, on the one hand, or the good sense of the ILC, on the other, when it comes to seeking to impose some very intrusive land management activity on a land-holder without their agreement. That would be a senseless thing to do. But what Senator Ellison is talking about is adding a new bureaucratic imposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows from the drafting of the bill that it is needed to have an open-ended clause in that way. If we do not have something in the functions clause, in 191E(1), which is broad enough to subsume this sort of thing that is covered by land management activity, then we would find ourselves in a situation where the corporation lacked the power to do certain things it might well want to do and which we might well want it to do, the classic case being the dissemination of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While again I am not in any way contesting the good intentions of that particular amendment, I put to the honourable senator that it is unnecessarily restrictive. We oppose it accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I still have a problem with the government's definition of `land management activities'. In subsection (5) there is a list of aspects of the definition, that is, it runs from (a) through to (e). They are all quite sensible, of course, but which ones are carried on by consent with the land-holders and which ones are not? Perhaps we need some definition in (c) to spell out that the land management activities do not include (a) of the definition, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">carrying on a business that involves the use, care or improvement of land.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something that should involve the consent of the land-holder because it is involving the land itself. That is why I say that when we look at the definition section in proposed subsection (a), that is a very different land management activity from simply providing services or disseminating information. So where we look at the definition of `land management activities', we are looking at a range, from (a) to (e). The definition in (a) starts with the `care or improvement of land', running right through to (e), `disseminating information'. That is quite harmless but could be of valuable assistance. But I am saying that on the question of how the land is used, the land-holder must be consulted and agreement obtained. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I put another way of solving the problem Senator Ellison is worried about? It really follows from the application of the general law of trespass. Obviously, if the ILC was wanting to go onto someone's land to engage in any of the intrusive land management practices that Senator Ellison is talking about, whether running a business or seeking to do anything else that operates against the spirit he has described&mdash;and if the ILC sought to do that without the consent of the land-holder in question&mdash;the ILC would be guilty of trespass under the existing general law. It is a reinforcement of the commonsense point I was making earlier. As a matter of practical administrative commonsense, we can assume that the ILC will not want to throw its weight around in that fashion&mdash;and there is a legal inhibition on its doing so, without consent, in those situations. I do not think the opposition needs the extra protection of the amendment to cover that situation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is what I want to explain. The bill refers to a number of services which could be performed in relation to the land. It is quite clearly the case that certain technical services could mean, in the case of urban land&mdash;not rural land&mdash;the entry onto those premises by ILC officers to look at the structure of a building or at some other matter. In relation to paragraph (e) of that proposed subsection and subparagraph (vi) where there are areas of particular significance to a particular tribal group, dissemination of information about sites there and so on could be contrary to the interests of that tribal group and contrary to their religious views in relation to certain areas of land that are held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has to ask itself one question: what is the greater mischief? Is it the greater mischief that the amendment be made or is it the greater mischief that it not be made? I think that if Senator Evans's sole concern is in relation to paragraph (e) of (5), I would find it very difficult to imagine a situation in which the dissemination of information would happen without the agreement of the landowners. If the information is of value, surely the landowners would agree to the dissemination of that information. If that is the only concern of Senator Evans, it seems that little mischief will be done to the bill by adding the amendment proposed by Senator Ellison. However, if the amendment is not accepted, perhaps a greater mischief is done to the holders of the land in creating an implied licence for the ILC to interfere in the management of that land against the will of the land-holder.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May the Lord spare me this amateur hour bush lawyer stuff. I have to say that because what Senator O'Chee is saying really is absolute nonsense&mdash;nonsense on stilts as Bentham would say. For a start, there is not an implied licence being granted in a way that would override the normal operation of the general law, unless there is a very clear implication in terms of the legislative structure. If it were the case that land management activities were described in terms which referred only to highly intrusive physical presence situations&mdash;and then there was a clause like this in general terms&mdash;there might be some point in what Senator O'Chee is saying. But when land management activities are described as an extremely broad spectrum of activities, only some of which are inherently intrusive in character, there simply is not the strength of the implication&mdash;or anything like it&mdash;in the language of 191E(1)(c) that would override a normal principle of general law which operates to allow intrusion in land only with consent. So that is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the balance of mischief that is involved in this, the difficulty is that proposed subsection (5) is only a definition subsection; it is not an empowering subsection. So unless there is some empowering language somewhere else in the bill, which empowers the ILC to carry out those land management functions as defined in (5), there is no point in having the definition. There has to be an empowering provision. So if we go back to the empowering subsection and the only empowering language is restrictive in character and requires an agreement to exist before one can perform the particular function in question, a very real restriction on the effective operation of the subsection is imposed. It is no good saying that there might be agreement to get information, or something of that kind. Yes, people might; but they have to go out first and seek it and acquire the agreement before getting into the business of disseminating it. It is not only information; it is services and training, it is paragraphs (c) and (d) as well as (e), that prima facie give rise to this problem.</PARA>

I cannot understand why the perfectly appropriate phrase in paragraph (a), `under agreements with the holders of the land', is not able to be carried under paragraph (c), with the exception of those things in paragraph (5) that Senator Evans feels would not require the permission of the land-holder. Otherwise, the bill is actually saying that through the powers of 191E(1)(a) we can arrange for the carrying on of land management activities in relation to indigenous held land under agreements with the holders of the land, but that if we do not get the agreements, that is fine. With (c) we can carry on other land management activities in relation to indigenous held land, full stop. What a lovely out!</PARA></TALK.START>

There has to be a better explanation than the one currently offered to account for the anomaly between (a) and (c). If there is any specific clause where this can be carried on without the agreement, that needs to be explicitly stated so that indigenous land-holders know where they stand and this particular clause cannot be pulled on them if they have failed to make an agreement under paragraph (a).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Ellison's point, I am not entirely sure that the drafting solution works completely but I think that the spirit of what he is saying is consistent with what I have been saying and I would be prepared to accept a modification of the opposition's amendment along those lines. It has been clear from the outset that he has seen the problem in subparagraph (5)(a) but has not really seen a problem with this in the other areas. The areas I am talking about are subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e), which talk about provision of services, training and information.

I cannot see any way of driving a more complicated path through subparagraphs (b) to (e). They are all about either services, training or information and they are by definition the sorts of things that the ILC might well want to offer on a nationwide basis or whatever. They are all cases that may in practice give rise to the problem. They are not going to be activities performed in an intrusive fashion because of the point we made earlier on about the applicability of the general law. If we want to put beyond doubt the carrying on of the business side of things and say that that can only happen by agreement, I do not think there is any policy problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette's other point was about the ILC's functions in relation to land which is not held by indigenous people. Well, it has not got any, has it? The ILC's function in land management is confined to the management of indigenous held land, which is a broader concept than land just acquired under this act. It extends to land which is held on a pre-existing basis by indigenous people. The ILC has no management functions that I can recall so far as non-indigenous held land is concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us look at that diagram. What it represents as a graph is how much money is available year by year in the land acquisition fund. The graph has been done on a best case scenario. In looking at the $21 million that ATSIC currently expends on land acquisition, I have to say that we have heard from the commission that $9 million of that $21 million goes on management of the acquired land. If this land fund is being used for acquisition, we can assume that an increasing proportion of the land acquisition fund total will not only be taken up with management of the land that is acquired but, because the bill widens its application to all indigenous-held land, the fund will have a much wider scope than managing just the land which is acquired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming there is a creeping in on the acquisition fund moneys of 10 per cent, we can also see from this diagram&mdash;and this is, as I have stressed, a best case scenario&mdash;that by the year 2003 only a very small amount will be allowed for land acquisition right throughout Australia. It could well be postulated that, without any controls on it, the figure could be much less than this and the amount available for management could be far greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the purpose of this amendment is to state a principle that the management costs attached to the land acquisition fund should not swallow up the entire fund within such a short time that those people who are least resourced to be able to apply and who do not receive the kind of priority that they could within the first five or 10 years of the fund do not lose totally any capacity to be assisted. If we do not have such a control mechanism in this bill, within a certain period&mdash;within X years&mdash;the whole $45 million that the government is committing from 10 years onwards will be used for land management only, and the land acquisition capacity will have disappeared. I welcome discussion on this point. I want people to take in the principle that is under consideration before I go on to speak further about this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe I have seen this diagram before. I do not think it has been the subject of any consultation with the coalition. My first view of it is that it would have to be regarded as an unnecessary fettering of the ILC. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) wants to accuse the coalition of trying to fetter the land fund and make it unworkable. We over here and the Greens know that that is not the intention of the coalition, and so do a hell of a lot of Aboriginal organisations around the country, as was shown at a media conference they held this afternoon. My view is that this amendment would certainly do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the point that Senator Chamarette makes, however, is a good one. In fact, I suggest that, if we wanted to make the graph accurate as the size of the land-holdings increased, there is no doubt that management costs may increase&mdash;and there may be very good reasons for that as well. I do not think Senator Chamarette or anybody here wants to say that the land management functions are any less important than land acquisition functions. Senator Chamarette is making the very good point that the amount actually available for land acquisition could be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very serious points raised by the Greens and by some of the Aboriginal organisations we have consulted with is the political con job, I guess, that is being perpetrated in relation to the size of the fund. The government would have the people of Australia believe that it is handing over $1.4 billion when in fact it is making a deposit into the public account and, effectively, all it is doing is increasing the money that the taxpayer or the government spends on land acquisition by between $21 million and $25 million a year. So it is a relatively small advance out of consolidated revenue for land acquisitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has been very forceful publicly in making sure that people understand that it is not a $1.4 billion land fund&mdash;some massive gesture to compensate Aboriginals for their dispossession&mdash;but that, in fact, only an amount between $21 million and $25 million will go towards land acquisition. That should be made clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would not be able to match the demands to increase the size of the fund, double the size of the fund and so forth. That is something that the coalition would have a lot of trouble with in the economic circumstances this government has placed Australia in. It would not be credible for the coalition, after calling for more fiscal restraint and bashing the government over the head every day about interest rates, to make a blanket promise to increase the size of the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the sort of approach required, if I can be so bold as to speak on behalf of the coalition on policy in this area&mdash;it certainly is not my portfolio&mdash;would be to say that, if the legislation were successful in the sort of form that it is moving towards with these amendments and it gets some runs on the board, a coalition government would like to look at the success of it in achieving the sorts of objectives we are building into it. At that stage we would of course look at the priorities for funding. Quite frankly, if the fund moves in the direction that our amendments are driving it,  with the support of the Greens, it could indeed be a very successful initiative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and may well be deserving of greater funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the point we are discussing here, I think the specific limiting to 10 per cent of land management appropriations within the overall annual budget may be a very unnecessary and potentially damaging fettering of the powers of the ILC board. Even though I appreciate what Senator Chamarette is getting at, I do not think this is something that will assist the overall objectives of the fund. I foreshadow that the coalition will oppose this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a number of reasons should be added to that bald statement. The first is that there is a really rather depressing underlying assumption, I think, on the part of the Greens that land purchased with land fund moneys will never result in going concerns that actually generate their own funds for sustainability and growth&mdash;the assumption being they will always be somehow dependent on ILC support and as more land is acquired more money, accordingly, will have to be spent on management. The assumption that land fund moneys, ultimately as a result of that process at work, are just about all going to be consumed by management is a pretty offensive assumption, I think, a paternalistic assumption of the kind that the Greens are constantly urging us to have no part of I think they are guilty of here in the underlying assumptions behind this chart they have put out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second further point I want to make is that I really do find it quite extraordinary that this green party, with its expressed concern for environmental issues, is attempting to place any limitation at all on the ability of the ILC to ensure the sustainable use and sensible management of indigenous-held land in circumstances where we cannot, for whatever reason, get that self-sustainability of which I have just been speaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, if we look back at the past, whatever might be the case in the future, we will see that it is the case that a great deal of the land that has been purchased for Aboriginal people had been degraded and was in an unproductive state when it was acquired. Some very large environmental tasks need to be addressed in relation to that existing stock of land, quite apart from any that might be acquired in the future. It really is important that the ILC has the flexibility&mdash;the practical flexibility as well as the charter formal flexibility&mdash;to address that particular environmental problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed at the government's response because I feel we are dealing here with a very serious question. I have asked the question on several occasions and the government has made no detailed investigation as to how much money would be required to redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people across Australia, and what proportion may be required to redress the legitimate management funding for the land that is to be acquired. The purpose of the amendment has nothing whatever to do with limiting management funding. It intends to put management funding where it belongs&mdash;in government responsibility and in other responsibilities, and not simply into the land acquisition fund to the detriment of those people who have yet to acquire anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we say that acquisition and management have equal weighting, I feel there should be some kind of control mechanism in this legislation to say that the amount of the fund that is to be expended on management will never exceed 50 per cent.

Not only is it not stated that there is some kind of control function to prevent the entire fund being used up for management, but it does not acknowledge how quickly that will happen. No research has been carried out into that aspect. The fund does not only address land which has been acquired in any one year and the management costs of that land. The fund purposes have been extended beyond any acquisition function to all indigenous-held land&mdash;that is, land that is currently held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis I used for my proportions was the reality that ATSIC told me that out of its budget for land acquisition and management it used some 50 per cent on management of the land it acquired. So it is a reasonable assumption and has nothing to do with viability of properties. It is the reality that the current expenditure on land is approximately half the total amount. For example, out of the sum of $21 million for this year, a figure of $9 million is already allocated to management by ATSIC. It said it wanted to spend $15 million but could not afford that discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go on the basis that for every piece of land one buys it will cost 100 per cent of that amount to maintain it, the fund will disappear as a land acquisition fund. But the fiction remains for at least 10-plus years because the so-called 10-year fund delivers only $45 million every year for ever&mdash;and even then without the Democrats top-up clause it would not even be guaranteed to receive $45 million. As Senator Campbell pointed out, the $3 million that is being allocated to administration costs could easily blow out from $3 million over that 10-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a tragedy that we are perpetrating on Aboriginal communities if, on the one hand, we publicly say that we are addressing the dispossession of 200 years and, on the other hand, we call it the land acquisition fund but do not care when it ceases to be a land acquisition fund. For all we know, and for all the government has investigated the matter, it could be a land management fund within five years or 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Evans that I am very concerned from a Green point of view about management, but the Pastoralists Association has said that it only approves of the land acquisition fund if 100 per cent is given for management of existing held properties to bring them up to a level that will not reduce pastoral industries' infrastructure. That was said in public testimony in the hearings in Perth to the native title committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have no misunderstandings here. The government is saying that management is not important. If it thought that management was that important, it would say that there is a land acquisition fund and a land management fund. If it were to do that, I would have no problems. But to perpetuate the fraud that says that this is a land acquisition fund, to have such a fund in name only, and then not care when it ceases to be one is another matter. This leaves all those Aboriginal people who have no land and who have no chance of acquiring any waiting for this magnificent part of the social justice package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear responsibility on the government to extend the funding so that there is not a robbing of one function by the other. The government has put both aspects together in the bill, but has not said how it seeks to deal with the extra $21 million a year. It has a responsibility to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge my colleagues in this chamber to look at their consciences because this is what they will be voting for. They can change it to a land management fund if they like and it still leaves the dispossessed of their lands something to hope for in the future. If we keep the situation as it is now before us, we will rob those Aboriginal people of their hopes and steal from them the possibility of gaining from the fund. </PARA>

But the more I listen to the debate, the more I think that the principle that one is fettering the ILC's activities by imposing an arbitrary limit is not good policy. Senator Chamarette is aware that in our proposed amendment No. 49, which the Greens have indicated they will support, we envisage a review after three years and that review is to be undertaken by the Auditor-General.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are probably not going to get to amendment No. 49 for a while, but we will try to put that very issue in as one of the things that must be assessed by the Auditor-General so that after three years we can get a very clear view to see whether or not Senator Chamarette's graphic predictions are coming true. Clearly, if the Auditor-General and the independent review pick that up, there will be enormous pressure on the government of the day to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a more sensible way to go and it achieves Senator Chamarette's wishes. Not only will management costs go up, but administration costs will go up as time goes on. We will probably find the squeeze on moneys for land acquisition occurring from both ends. It is something that needs to be looked at and we will seek to put in a new subsection 3B in amendment No. 49 and hope that the Senate will support it. I think that is a more practical way of achieving that aim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to read into the record what Commissioner David Ross from ATSIC said about the management functions referred to in this bill. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other thing that should be considered by everyone on that side of the table, as I heard earlier in the questioning of the government, is the management side and things of that nature. Part of management also goes to dealing with capital and infrastructure. We must remember that, when we acquire on behalf of Aboriginal people different pastoral leases, farming properties and other bits of land around the country, most of these places are very degraded. Most of the infrastructure is very run down. It seems to me to be a very cheap way for most of the states and territories to get the Commonwealth to put capital into infrastructure in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make the point that we always seem to come back to relying on the responsibility of the Commonwealth and that he would not like us to consider this bill as the only opportunity for funds for management. He believes that we ought to be talking to state and territory governments about some pastoral leases and whether they are so marginal that they should be taken out of the pastoral estate because he says that they are a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ross asks us to think about the politics of not even requiring states and territories to have some responsibility for management functions in relation to Aboriginal held land. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have had ministerial political interference saying that it will not be done because the land is held by Aboriginal people and, therefore, for ever and a day they will pour money in, because the Commonwealth has lots of money, to maintain the covenants on these leases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I supplement Senator Kernot's point with one further point that perhaps needs emphasising. The ILC, as a quasi-commercial body, will be able to access private sector sources of finance for land management, which landholders by themselves may not be able to access. It is not a question of this land fund&mdash;which, by the way, is called the land fund, not the land acquisition fund&mdash;being a finite pot of money, and the only money that will be available for acquisition, on the one hand, and management on the other; such that any money spent on management will necessarily diminish the pot available for acquisition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, although some money will come out of the basic fund for management, as we have been discussing, the ILC itself will have access to other sources of funds. In particular, let us very much hope that a lot of this land can be obtained rather quickly on a commercially self-sustaining basis.

I was making the point that, while management is important, there is no guarantee in this bill that there is acquisition money that will be ongoing. Senator Evans has reassured me&mdash;though I do not know how much of a reassurance it is&mdash;that such commercial activities will be carried on by the ILC that it will be able to get more money to fund management. However, I have not been assured that there will be any other opportunity for those people dispossessed of their land to actually acquire land, if they do not already have it, from any other source but this fund.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have been listening to the debate about land acquisition and land management. Surely, if we buy land that is well run down, as Senator Kernot said, we will need more money for management. If the land is so run down, we should get it at a give-away price. It is similar to buying a farm that is run down; we need to put a lot into it, so the price is down. We put money into it and we get it up to standard. If we buy one that is up at the top, we do not need to spend so much on land management or land improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is the opposition's amendment in a nutshell. I do not think there is anything terribly controversial in it. It is not of great weight, but I think it just might afford the ILC an opportunity to express to the minister why it took a certain course of action. That at least gives it the protection of the act. </PARA>

The ILC cannot disclose the substance of something to the minister without being in breach of its obligations to keep secret sacred information.

To avoid all these complicated problems about the interrelationship between a national strategy and regional strategies, we are proposing to remove the requirement to prepare a national strategy which would, if accepted, require rationally the withdrawal of Green amendments J1, J2, J3 and J5, possibly K1 as well, and opposition amendments 17, 18, 19 and 20.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Chamarette seems to have failed to acknowledge&mdash;I thought we had at least some measure of agreement on this&mdash;is that series J would be redundant and not necessary in the event that there was support for the proposed government amendment. We were being responsive to a Green concern. Rather than leaping into her J series, perhaps she can contemplate the scale of the concession I am now about to offer to her concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life is getting a bit difficult when we cannot even move into a give away without getting a bucket thrown on us. What we are trying to say is that the bill started out with an obligation to propose a national strategy and a set of regional strategies. There was anxiety expressed on the part of the Greens and, to some extent, on the part of the opposition that somehow the regional strategies with which people had a prior concern, because of the general belief that regional strategies were more likely to be responsive to the needs of people on the ground, might be swamped by some national strategy which was not as responsive by its very nature to the needs of people on the ground. So we had a whole set of amendments being moved in a rather complicated, tortuous way to try to somehow resolve this perceived difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are now prepared to concede is that rather than creating the potential for such difficulty by having two simultaneous statutory obligations&mdash;to have regional strategies on the one hand and the national one on the other&mdash;we would withdraw the reference to a statutory obligation to prepare a national strategy. There may well be some view on the part of the ILC that there are some guidelines for the administration of the fund and the management principles and so on, which will sensibly be capable of being drawn up as a management tool and just as a rational way of organising its business. It may or may not want to describe those guidelines as elements of a national strategy. But it would be very difficult, I think we would concede, to accurately express in some single strategy document the needs and aspirations of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the way that was contemplated in the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens proposed that the bill be amended to require that regional strategies have precedence over the national strategy, and that the national strategy be constructed on the basis of the regional strategies. As I am saying, rather than getting into that sort of territory and having the possibility if we do that of having each one of the strategies being challenged by someone because all of this is a statutory obligation&mdash;therefore it is justiciable and people do not like what has been produced and so on&mdash;we are suggesting that it might be best to delete the obligation, the requirement, altogether for the ILC to prepare national strategies, such that regional strategies would now provide the basis for the ILC's decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a significant shift of government position. It has demonstrated that we are listening to the concerns. It also demonstrates that we want to conclude this debate before Christmas, and it will be very difficult to do that if we start plunging into the mire of the amendments in the J series of the Greens and the other competing series from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a position that we were discussing a couple of weeks ago when we were all talking to each other about possibly reaching a sensible accommodation on this bill and had not moved into quite the kind of confrontation mode that we have at the moment. But in the context of those discussions, the government made it reasonably clear, I thought, that we were prepared to go down this path. I am sorry if that has got lost in the rush of further events, but we are still prepared to go down that path, and I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Evans did say that he would be willing to address this and we did see the amendments, we in no way agreed to them. So I have to inform him that the Greens actually do not support his amendments and we do not see getting rid of the national strategy as a real way out. It is something that he persists in wanting to use for the ILC. I quote his words, `Rather than getting into an overt structure which can be challenged, they just drop it out.' I am afraid I do not regard that as an equivalent reversal of priorities from regional to national. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we simply delete the word `national' without giving the priority to the regional level and we just say, `Well, no doubt there will be some kind of implicit national type of organisation for the ILC to be able to make sense of the regional strategies, but we do not need to actually put that in,' that is not an adequate response. So I think it would be a good idea over the dinner break for the government, the opposition and everyone else in the chamber to consider how we can best emphasise the regional importance of any strategy which is to be dealing with the land acquisition and management program. </PARA>

<PARA>The L series of amendments that the Greens are presenting refer to the right to dispose of or charge property. This amendment omits the proposed sections 191S and 191T. These sections force indigenous land-holders to gain the consent of the ILC before disposing of, or making a charge against, any property which they have obtained through the ILC.

I find it absolutely inconceivable that the Greens could take this course if they are seriously concerned about redressing injustice to Aboriginal people and doing something to build a land base for Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future, a base that cannot be eroded or leached away for purposes that bear no relationship to the basic philosophy of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also find it inconceivable, I might say, if the opposition were to support this because of the accountability principles that would be so dramatically impinged upon if removal of this limitation on the way in which Aboriginal land can be alienated were to be approved. It is obvious, I would have thought, that it is improper and inequitable for organisations&mdash;or now individuals, who can now benefit from free land under this legislation&mdash;to profit from the disposal of land for which they have made no financial contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A route is being opened up for unscrupulous individuals to convert Aboriginal land to cash. There is a total weakening of the accountability process. This is about giving land to Aboriginal people. It is not about giving a source of potential profit to Aboriginal people. There may well be circumstances in which that land will need to be disposed of by way of mortgage or, in special circumstances, for some other reason. I cannot think for the moment what that other reason might be other than as part of a reconsolidation of a pastoral property&mdash;selling off one bit in order to acquire another. An arrangement of that kind may make sense. But if there is a good reason associated with the philosophy and proper implementationist legislation for a disposal to take place, it can be assumed that the ILC will consent to it, as is provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To create an open-ended capacity for Aboriginal beneficiaries of taxpayers' largess&mdash;not largess that is available to anyone else in the country but to Aboriginal people for the very specific purpose of acquiring land as a source of redress, among other things, for centuries of dispossession&mdash;simply to throw away the grant, once made, and convert it to cash profit, with the disappearance of that element of the Aboriginal land base as that happens, is so fundamentally at odds with the basic philosophy of this legislation that it really is ludicrous.

I see that Mr Dillon is shaking his head, but he has been quoted before as saying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the legislation is that the ILC will purchase the land. The indigenous land-holders can then use the land, but they are required to ask the permission of the ILC whenever they want to do anything with it. When it comes to selling the land or having any other dealings with it, they have to go to the ILC and ask for permission. When it comes to sale of the land, under section 191T they may then surrender their interests to the ILC, subject to the terms and conditions as agreed between the body corporate and the ILC. These are the sorts of provisions that make this act entirely paternalistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We share with the Greens the view that when seeking to address the disadvantage of Aboriginals we should place a little bit of trust in them and a little bit of power in their hands. Yesterday, Senator Evans spoke eloquently when describing his friend who shared his home with him when he was doing his law studies. He spoke about his friend's intrinsic and spiritual need to get out of Melbourne and feel the benefit of his spiritual links with the land. Now Senator Evans is asking the committee to believe his assumption that people like his friend, Aboriginal people who have been fighting to gain land for generations, would seek to sell their land to make a quick cash profit. That is the very kind of paternalism that we in the coalition believe is the root cause of the failure of many of the Aboriginal affairs policies that have been visited upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians for the past 10 or 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very happy to support the Greens' amendment to delete these provisions. We believe that, if we are to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, we have to give them some trust and we have to give them the power to make some of their own decisions. Of course, 191S and 191T are the very provisions that ensure that we do not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ellison reminded me a minute ago, only yesterday Senator Evans was saying that we cannot grant land to individuals because an Aboriginal man might marry a white woman. To him, it would be outrageous to think that the Aboriginal man might die and bequeath that property to his non-Aboriginal wife. When I suggested by way of interjection that they might have children and that the Aboriginal children might also benefit from the land, he said, `For the purposes of this hypothetical case, let's pretend they didn't have any children.' Of course, that is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, if an Aboriginal man has chosen to marry a non-Aboriginal woman, that non-Aboriginal woman has clearly become a part of that family and a part of that community. Under the entirely non-partisan view of what determines Aboriginality, that woman, for all intents and purposes, would see herself as part of the Aboriginal community anyway. So the minister drew an absurd concept, and it is equally absurd when applied to these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that if we are to empower Aboriginal Australians we should do so with goodwill and trust. If any Aboriginal person was to read these provisions carefully&mdash;as so many of the Aboriginals that we have spoken to over the last week have done&mdash;they would realise that these provisions severely restrict even their self-determination, to use that term. The provisions impose restrictions on the right to dispose of or charge property and they apply when the body corporate acquires an interest in the land. The body corporate must not, without the consent of the ILC, dispose of an interest or have any other dealing with the land. Further, if it does so without informing the ILC, the deal has no effect. That creates all sorts of other problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition originally settled on the course of trying to soften up these restrictions, to ensure that things were done in consultation with and with due regard to the interests of the indigenous land-holders. The opposition has given this matter due consideration; we have read the provisions up and down. We believe, as does Senator Chamarette, in the principle of giving Aboriginal people a say in what they do with their own land&mdash;the sort of say that other Australians have, that our forebears had when they were granted or given land, that all other Australians enjoy&mdash;</PARA>

Senator Collins says, `Why don't you just cut out the middle man and give them the cash?' The truth of the matter is that this is not a paternalistic piece of legislation.

I am not saying that people will acquire the land and seek to sell it within 24 hours or anything like that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad, but in order to make sure that Aboriginal people's land stays there, it is never given to them; they are simply allowed to use it, which fosters an illusion of possession which is not in reality full possession with no strings attached. It was pointed out earlier today that that is 20 years out-of-date paternalism. I believe it underlies the inherent fraud and paternalism of this bill. On the one hand, there is a `billion dollar fund' that never leaves consolidated revenue, that never leaves the public account, and there is a draw-down from it which does not go to Aboriginal people; it goes to non-Aboriginal people&mdash;$42 million a year&mdash;in order to give Aboriginal people land. On the other hand, it is not given to them. We just let them use it, provided they meet the conditions and the requirements of the ILC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry, but that is not giving Aboriginal people the power and trust they deserve. If it is a risk, we should give them that risk. Before non-Aboriginal Australia gets too self-righteous about giving taxpayers' money in order to give the land to Aboriginal people, we ought to remember what Senator Campbell referred to in passing. Not many of us have actually bought our land. A lot of us have inherited land. Our ancestors were given land originally. They were given leases. There was the settlers scheme. Many families owe their current prosperity to land that they were given. Even if we were not given land, even if some of us bought land, just remember that nobody bought it from the original owners in the first place. So there is no harm whatsoever in giving it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have expressed concern&mdash;which I have labelled paternalistic&mdash;about this unwillingness to give back the land. Senator Gareth Evans pointed out quite correctly that there are some phrases in the ATSIC act that imply that land acquired through ATSIC funds cannot be disposed without permission. It is not mentioned in the Northern Territory land rights act, which is an interesting case for those people who are concerned that, if Aboriginal people are given land by the land fund, they will somehow dispose of it and lose it for their own community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one very easy non-paternalistic way out of it: support the amendment that the Greens will be presenting later on which allows native title to be revived. If we give them inalienable rights to their land we do not have to worry. It stays in the Aboriginal estate&mdash;if one wants to use that term&mdash;except that, then, the Aboriginal estate is owned by Aboriginal people. It is kept in the land stock, but it is kept in the land stock of the indigenous owners&mdash;the people who were here prior to European settlement. So there is a non-paternalistic way to guard and protect Aboriginal land for Aboriginal people to use. It is one which gives them back the rights we took from them when we stole their land in the first place and never paid them for it and do not rightly possess it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just because the Crown has been able to extinguish land and to grant freehold land here and there, it does not mean we have a legitimate moral right to that land. Those of us with land which has been extinguished from native title are very fortunate. But the least we can do is offer that same right back to Aboriginal people so that, when they get land from this land fund, they at least have the same right as we do over land we hold&mdash;that is, the right to dispose of it as they see fit, to whom they see fit, and on whatever terms they see fit; to put a mortgage on it; or to sell it in exchange for some other venture or piece of land that they want.

We are not having a Clayton's land fund. We are not having one in which the Indigenous Land Corporation is going to be the biggest land-holder in the country and hold land on trust inter vivos for some people who, it considers, cannot make those decisions themselves. That is what these two proposed sections mean. A look at the situation reveals that it is worse than paternalism; it is a collectivism, a communism, an absolute intrusion by the state&mdash;`the state will control this land so long as it suits us. We are not giving you the land; it will remain under our control. You get your pastoral lease, but it is not yours to have and to hold because you cannot get rid of it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have a lease or a piece of property in this country normally can divest themselves of it. That is a famous Australian tradition&mdash;owning a piece of land and a house and being able to sell it. But that is lost on this government, because it wants to retain those strings over the land it has supposedly granted. It will not allow the grantees&mdash;the recipients&mdash;to be able to dispossess themselves of the land without prior consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absolutely disgraceful that government members can talk about having a land fund to grant land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and then still hold on to it by this control. Could honourable senators imagine other Australians being put in the position of not being allowed to sell their home without going back to the bank or, even worse, the government? What sort of country are we going to be living in? It is unAustralian and it is unfair. Either they are given land or they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as accountability goes, let me remind the government of opposition amendment No. 5A, which deals with the amendments to proposed new section 191D(2). It says that, where the Indigenous Land Corporation makes a grant of money, it may do so on terms. These terms and conditions could include the purpose for which the money is spent; that is, we can tell them, `We're giving you this money but you've got to spend it on this particular purpose. Nonetheless, it is yours, but it has to be spent on that purpose.' That section also addresses the issue of the period within which the money is to be spent. If the money is given to a corporation, it cannot sit on it so that the members of the corporation or the community do not enjoy the benefits of it. There must be a time period. The acquittal of the money spent is another condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the condition that there be giving of information in relation to the grant. Finally, if the grant is breached in any of its terms, the money becomes repayable. That is more than enough in relation to accountability. We allow terms and conditions not only for a grant of money, but also for loans and guarantees. A guarantee can be subject to such terms and conditions as the ILC sees fit. The same applies to a loan of money. Much like a bank, the ILC can impose its own terms and conditions but, once that is done, recipients are free to do what they will with the loan&mdash;just as all other Australian citizens are free to do with it what they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the thrust of our accountability. We are saying that we do not just give Aboriginal people land, money and guarantees holus-bolus. We have imposed conditions and avenues of accountability so that the recipients remain accountable for their actions in relation to the money received. That is done. That is all there in these amendments. But 191S and 191T tend to keep the strings over the land, so we end up with one of the biggest land trustees in Australia's history. With about $20 million a year, it is just going to keep adding to the stock. In fact, it will end up controlling vast tracts of land because the recipients will not be able to dispose of the land without getting the consent of this monolithic, gigantic ogre&mdash;the ILC. The recipients will have to go to the ILC before they can dispose of the land. That is absolutely not on. The banks and interest rates we have now are bad enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation, the government is giving grants with one hand and taking them back with the other. We cannot have this bureaucracy&mdash;the ILC&mdash;retaining such control over the grants that are made. It is Indian giving at its worst. How the government can say that our amendment is disingenuous and lacks good faith staggers me. I can say only that it screams out to heaven for vengeance&mdash;while one claims moral virtue, one is raping and prostituting the very morals and virtues that one espouses. `The hottest place in hell,' said Dante, `is reserved for such people.' That is where the government stands on the most despicable piece of legislation that I have seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government senators use these great terms from the preamble to the Native Title Act and say that they will form a land fund for dispossessed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But it is a land fund which is no land fund at all; it is just a method of collecting and accumulating land for a bureaucracy called the ILC. In true liberal terms, we believe that a decision should be made whether to give or not to give&mdash;we either give these people the land or we do not. It is Sydney or the bush. `If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.' There is no halfway. Once the decision has been made to grant these people land, it should be done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience, there are two extremes in terms of how non-Aboriginal people in this country deal with Aboriginal people. I am pleased to say that there is a group of people in the middle. But the two extremes are these: we either treat Aboriginal people like dirt; or, on the other hand, we put Aboriginal people on a pedestal and invest them with all kinds of superhuman characteristics that no other human being on this planet possesses. That is where the Greens come from on this matter. I do not want to be too hard on the Greens because I know that they are only visiting us on this planet and that one day they will go back to Zork where they came from. So I am not ascribing conspiracy motives to them. They are genuinely motivated in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have no doubt about the effect of supporting a combination of the amendments moved to allow grants to individual Aboriginal people. The ability to dispose of the land and make a windfall profit from it 24 hours after they acquire it would be an absolute disaster in the administration of this scheme. That is the heart of this amendment, and the government is right to oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will deal with a number of references to paternalism made by Senator Chamarette. Senator Ellison used to death all the high-flown and high-blown rhetoric about paternalism and so on. There is one fundamental flaw in his argument about paternalism in this regard; that is, this is a structure uniquely for the benefit of Aboriginal Australians and no-one else. There is no valid comparison with how the government would deal with non-Aboriginal people in respect of the control of the land. As Senator Gareth Evans pointed out so succinctly and correctly&mdash;I was in here listening to him before dinner&mdash;these are grants that are rightly and properly given to Aboriginal people which non-Aboriginal people simply do not get the benefit of.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were going to include provisions whereby the ILC would need to register caveats when it had interests in the land. When we read the bill closely we see that the ILC has an interest in land everywhere&mdash;it has an interest in every single piece of land. I finally found the passage quoting Mr Dillon at the committee hearing the other day. Senator Chamarette will remember him talking about the assets of the land fund. I will repeat what he said because it is very important that people understand that the ILC will maintain an interest in every single piece of land that it purchases in perpetuity. Mr Dillon was asked about the assets of the trust when Senator Kernot, I think it was, was raising doubts about whether the fund was worth $1.4 million. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We actually have a much larger asset than the asset in the fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is not just $1.4 million&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>That is, the government has the land that the ILC purchases and manages but Mr Dillon believes that that is an asset of the ILC. Senator Chamarette went on to ask:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you have the fund but you also have a net addition to the purchases of land that are being put into the hands of Aboriginal people. Taking those two together there is a net addition to the assets held by Aboriginal people.</PARA>

Senator Kernot has raised, probably privately&mdash;I am not sure whether she referred to it in her contribution&mdash;that this is an abrogation of all of the things that the coalition has ever said about accountability and ATSIC.

Senator Collins is quite right: just like with any other human being, we are going to find people whom we can trust and who will do the right thing and people to whom we can give some responsibility. Of course, there will be Aboriginals, as there are in so many ATSIC cases, who will abuse the system. But, quite frankly, having the ILC maintaining control over the land is not going to solve that problem.

That relates to the question of strings being attached to the grant of money. We can give money to people, they go down the road, they can spend it, they can gamble it or whatever. A grant of land is something different. That means a transfer of title that goes into a person's name.</PARA></TALK.START>

When we make that grant to the individual, the groups&mdash;and of course the ILC no doubt would make this choice very carefully&mdash;we do it with those criteria in mind. If people then want to divest themselves of that land at a later stage, they exercise a right like any other person in Australia.

<PARA>This amendment deals with acquired land from the land fund not being claimable under the Northern Territory land rights act. Our amendment seeks to delete proposed section 191U, which prohibits land acquired under this act from being claimed under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we heard during the hearing of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on this bill, this measure is designed to meet the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Marshall Perron. When speaking during the second reading debate, Senator Tambling tabled the correspondence in which the Prime Minister gave a commitment that any land acquired through this land fund would not be able to be used under the Northern Territory land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) see no reason at all why land acquired under this bill should not be claimable under the Northern Territory land rights act. We believe that, because the government does not want to upset the two Northern Territory land councils, which quite rightly could and should be upset, it is attempting to divert away from the ILC half the money available for land acquisition over the next three years through ATSIC and thus partially escape this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all heard at the committee hearings how pleased Minister Hatton was about that arrangement. In fact, we are indebted to him because without him we would not have known about that arrangement. We also believe that without section 191U there would be no need for a split of moneys between the ILC and ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to remove the restriction on claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. I have made it clear to the Northern Territory land councils that the Greens (WA) thoroughly disapprove of the arrangements that the government has reached with the territory government over land acquired under this bill. We have also made it clear that we disapprove of the split of moneys between the ILC and ATSIC, which is designed to escape from the deal that the Prime Minister made with Marshall Perron. However, it would be churlish, to use one of Senator Evans's favourite words, and ungenerous of us to remove the split unless proposed section 191U is also removed. If we are successful in deleting this section, we propose to alter the bill so that, as of the beginning of financial year 1995-96, all land fund moneys should be made to the Indigenous Land Corporation and not ATSIC. Later in this debate we will also move an amendment to remove the sunset clause from the Northern Territory land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole issue throws into the spotlight the issue of the sunset clause on claims under the Northern Territory land rights act. That will be in three years time; the split goes for three years. The whole reason for diverting half the money through ATSIC would appear to be to maximise the amount of land acquired in the Northern Territory in the next three years so that it can be claimed before the sunset clause comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was shocked to discover that it was the Hawke government which moved to place a limit on the time available for claims under the Northern Territory land rights act. I was also shocked to find a total absence of any opposition in either house of the parliament. Why should there be a limit on the time available for land to be claimed in the Northern Territory? Why should this bill make it inappropriate for acquired land to be claimable under the Northern Territory land rights act? It is an outrage, and the purpose of this amendment is to address that matter. Whether or not the amendment is passed, it should go on the public record because it exposes for all to see the kinds of deals that underlie this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment. I think the background to it is well known. The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act, although pastoral leases purchased by the corporation will be eligible for conversion to native title under section 47 of the Native Title Act. There are no barriers to land acquired by ATSIC being claimed under the land rights act prior to the cut-off date for claims, which is 1997. This is just a matter of getting a reasonable balance between the competing claims and interests here. We are not prepared to allow the potential for open slather on conversions to inalienable freehold prior to the cut-off for claims. On that basis we oppose this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be remembered that already nearly 40 per cent of land in the Northern Territory is held by Aboriginal people under inalienable title under the provisions of the land rights act in the Northern Territory. It is against that background and in that context that this particular limitation has been introduced. It is obviously a reasonably sensitive issue, not only as between the Commonwealth and the territory government but also with the Aboriginal people themselves. It is one of those provisions that have been seen to be a reasonable compromise between the competing claims and interests that are involved. Accordingly, we recommend the clause to the Senate in its present form and oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens will be supporting opposition amendments 31 and 34, which refer to the chairperson being appointed by the Prime Minister rather than the Minister for Finance. However, the Greens do not support opposition amendment 32, which refers to the deputy chairperson being appointed by the Minister for Finance. We have a proposed amendment D7, which omits reference to consultation because we think it is an impertinence. We think it reinforces the fact that this is a government board and a government operative and is not a valid way to make the appointment. So the Greens have a proposed amendment D7 which removes the requirement for consultation with the Minister for Finance on the appointment of the director of the ILC.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not support that kind of flexibility and openness. We feel that there has to be an accountability factor. On the other hand, the government has restricted the recipients to an enormous degree and we have been trying to release those restrictions.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are quite a few appointments to this board and it would be good if certain commissioners were elected to it.

<PARA>This clause omits the need to consult the Minister for Finance on the appointment of the director of the ILC. I have already stated my reasons for that. I know Senator Gareth Evans regards it as churlish. It is unnecessary and I do not see why it should be included. As he pointed out so clearly when the amendment was moved by the opposition, even if the Prime Minister made the appointment, it would be through the minister and then, presumably, there would be a capacity to consult that does not have to be written in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is perfectly true that it does not need to be written in because, as a practical matter, one would expect that consultation to occur, even if it is only across the cabinet table when the appointment comes for endorsement by the cabinet, as I said was the practice. However, it is not unusual in legislation where very large sums of money are involved for an explicit consultative provision to be written in with the Minister for Finance just to ensure that the disposition of that money is properly done. The ILC will be responsible for the expenditure of very large amounts of money. Proposed section 191X(4) of the bill provides that, among the expertise of the directors of the ILC, there has to be experience in business or finance management. It is therefore appropriate, as we see it, that the Minister for Finance should be consulted on the appointment of directors of the corporation and that particular statutory attention be given to that consultative process in this context. It is not a world shattering matter were this to come out, but I indicate the government's position and the reasons for it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that people felt it was offensive in this day and age to imply that two of the members should be non-Aboriginal because Aboriginal people may not have all the skills that were required. The Aboriginal people at that meeting felt assured that the finance and accounting skills to meet those needs could be found within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and they specifically asked me to put that. So I am moving that amendment and I will be calling a division&mdash;well, I may not call a division but I will if there is any dispute&mdash;because I think it is important to put that on the record for the Aboriginal people at the Melbourne meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About which I do not think there is any contention, but we can sort that out when we get there. I wish to respond to M1&mdash;which is the only amendment in front of us at that moment&mdash;which removes the provision of a chairperson and at least four others, and substitutes a requirement that all of the corporation board members be of indigenous descent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes it possible for all board members to be indigenous but does not make this a requirement. It is likely that the board will be all indigenous when there are indigenous people with the appropriate level of expertise available to be part of it. There may be circumstances in which it may be helpful to the ILC to use the skills and experiences of non-indigenous experts in a situation where there are perhaps insufficient indigenous people available to play that role. It is helpful for there to be that extra degree of flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, the bill is based on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Indigenous Commercial Development Corporation model, which provides that at least five of the nine board members must be indigenous. It is the same principle. It is important to note that, in the context of that corporation, some quite crucial contributions have been made by some of its non-indigenous members who have been appointed because of their expertise in financial and business matters. I am thinking in this respect of people like Mr Brian Wright of the Commonwealth Bank; Lawrie Willett, who is head of Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd; and Professor Bob Walker, who I guess would be acknowledged to be Australia's pre-eminent independent expert in public sector accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it stands, we see the bill as providing the correct balance between, on the one hand, the need for obviously indigenous direction and self-determination but, on the other hand, the need to absolutely ensure that the appropriate expertise is available for appointment to the board. It is to be very much hoped that that expertise would be available within the indigenous population. If it is, it would be perfectly appropriate for the whole board to be constituted in that way. I think most people would argue or acknowledge, even if this was not the message which came from the meeting to which Senator Chamarette referred, that there is virtue in flexibility of this kind at this stage at least of the evolution of this institution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this amendment is an unnecessary restriction. As Senator Evans quite properly pointed out, it may be advantageous to the board and, therefore, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that they avail themselves of the expertise of some non-indigenous Australians when the board is first composed.

That expert advice can come from anywhere; it can come from people who may be Aboriginal, and it can come from people who may not be Aboriginal. That is not the issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this proposal from the Greens. It simply adds three additional requirements for election to the ILC board, all of which the minister must be satisfied on. In doing so, we believe it imposes unreasonable restrictions on the discretion of the minister in making appointments. The problem is that, while on the face of it each of the additional proposed tests is fairly innocuous looking, they are really of extremely uncertain ambit and make it very, very difficult to know what exactly are the considerations that the minister is supposed to be taking into account in determining, in this instance, whether a person is `broadly representative' of the interests of the Aboriginal people to whom the part is directed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, how is it possible for one person to be broadly representative of both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the qualification requires? Just to ask the question makes clear the problem. The amendment requires that, in addition, a person has to satisfy all three of these criteria&mdash;not only to be broadly representative but also to have satisfactorily performed his role and to perform his function satisfactorily in the future. We need to have the foresight of the Hebrew prophet combined with the capacity of an Einstein to identify the way in which someone will satisfy these criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A real paragon is clearly being sought. We are all in favour of paragons being appointed to boards, but it is a bit difficult to find them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quickly put the coalition position. Very much for the reasons that Senator Harradine has already articulated, we would prefer the Senate to support our amendments 35 and 36. In part, our amendment 36 seeks to achieve one of the principal objectives of M2A, part (a).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the amendment is just a little bit too restrictive, particularly because, as Senator Harradine said, when we are looking at someone who has performed a representative role we can envisage that there are a number of people who would serve on boards. Board directors do not necessarily represent anyone or have to have had experience in representing anyone. They genuinely need experience in decision making and various other forms of experience. A representative role may not be a valuable prerequisite, even though for some people on the board it will be; they would have had representative roles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, at the request of the government in the lunchtime debate on matters of public interest, I cut short a speech that I was making on the superannuation losses suffered by 35 former McDonnell and East employees. I wish to return to some of the points I was making in that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue was the transfer of funds to high risk property investment. One may ask whether it was prudent to increase the investment in the unlisted property trusts by $450,000. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> on 23 October 1994, Mr Meek stated that, in June 1990, when the superannuation funds were first invested, the property trusts had a liquidity of only 4 per cent. An article published in the 20 July 1990 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> compared the liquidity of 22 unlisted property trusts and identified the Northern Securities trusts as having the fourth worst liquidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One month later, in August 1990, the fund manager and trustee suspended repurchase requests, evidently in an attempt to overcome the liquidity problems. In light of these events, it becomes obvious that it was imprudent to substantially increase the superannuation fund's exposure to what had become an illiquid and high-risk investment. Again I ask: who was responsible for that decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that needs to be answered is: why did the property trusts perform so badly? The answer becomes self-evident when we look at the movement in unit prices over the period. When the superannuation fund's cash was first invested in the property trusts in June 1990, the value of growth units was at an all-time high of $1.18. Six months later the value peaked at $1.19, and from then on it was all downhill with the unit price dropping to 58c at June 1993&mdash;less than half what they were worth when the superannuation fund first bought into them. What went wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superfunds</EMPHASIS> in August 1994, Mr Meek suggested that the vast majority of property trusts suffered declines in value during the period in question. I believe that the problem is not just a simple case of decline in general market conditions. In general, my concerns relate to the timing of property valuations and write-offs of capitalised expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into specific details, but will use the write-off of development costs to demonstrate how a drop in unit values was caused by management decisions, not market conditions. The write-offs relate to a property development for which expenses of $3.5 million were capitalised over a number of years prior to December 1990. That development did not proceed and these capital costs were written off over subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that in 1990 purchasers of property trust units paid an extra eight cents per unit for the value of the development costs. When that value was subsequently wiped out with the costs write-offs, the value of the units held by those unfortunate unit holders also dropped. This explains the cause of some of the MacDonnell and East superannuation losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, an alarming aspect of this saga was the apparent failure of the watchdog, the auditor, who should have alerted the employer and relevant authorities to the problems. The Norsec super fund's accounts for December 1991 and June 1992 showed that the auditor, Kendalls KBM, issued qualified audit opinions for both periods, citing breaches of the trust deed and Corporations Law which were caused by investments in associated trusts exceeding the covenanted limit of 30 per cent. Yet the auditor had not qualified the earlier June 1991 accounts, when there had clearly been similar breaches. The 30 per cent limit was also exceeded in the very first reporting period in June 1990. Did the auditor qualify that report? I do not know the answer to the question, but I suspect the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears the auditor was catnapping for the first 18 months of the fund's operation and then suddenly woke up to the fact that things were not as they should be. Unfortunately, particularly for the members of the fund, by that time the damage was already done. Had the auditor been doing the job properly and issued qualified audit opinions on the accounts for the earlier reporting periods, the employer and the ISC would have been alerted to the problems earlier, and perhaps would have taken action which may have avoided some or even all of the losses. The Senate will understand my apprehension about the safety of superannuation funds given the evidence I have placed on the public record on three occasions in the past few weeks. </PARA>

<PARA>In acknowledgment of the effort that numbers of people have made to at least gather the signatures together, I want to put on the public record that the total number of signatures is 1,433.
