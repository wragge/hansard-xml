<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans. What did the minister mean at the weekend when he said he `spoke too strongly in the present tense' when he accused Thailand of providing support and sanctuary to Khmer Rouge soldiers? How could such a mistake have been made? Is he again blaming the officers of his department? Will he tell the Senate what effect his mistake will have on our relations with Thailand, what influence it will have at the APEC meeting and what effect it will have on trade relations with Thailand in particular?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is simply this: in a spirit, I suppose, of conciliation which we were trying to get at in resolving this issue as between the two of us, the foreign minister and I had a long talk about the whole subject of cross-border activity by the Khmer Rouge. It was certainly the longest, frankest, most productive and, I think, most encouraging talk I have had on that subject&mdash;and I have had many of them over the years&mdash;with representatives of the Thai government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation essentially is this: if we look back at the history of this, during the period of the Vietnamese occupancy of Cambodia from 1978 to 1989 there was unequivocal and openly acknowledged Thai government and military support for the Khmer Rouge, as indeed there was for other elements of the anti-Hun Sen government resistance. Following the installation of the Chatichai government in 1989 and the withdrawal of the Vietnamese, that support took a less overt military form but was more than amply compensated by a huge amount of business activity, not least so far as the logging and gem industries were concerned, with results with which we are all too unhappily familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Chuan government came into office in 1992, and in the context of the UN operation&mdash;by that stage, of course, in full swing&mdash;there was a stated determination on the part of the Chuan government to sever those linkages which had traditionally existed, and a number of steps were taken, including consolidation of bans on arms trades, on logs, on gems, and a stated intention to be more effective in limiting that access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that for a very long period, despite the excellent intentions of the Chuan government, it has to be said, there were many elements within Thailand that were still offering forms of assistance, nowhere more conspicuously so as recently as just a few months ago, in April-May this year, when&mdash;in the context of the abortive Cambodian military operations at Pailin and Anlong Veng&mdash;overt support of a major kind was given to Khmer Rouge forces, enabling them to regroup and remount an assault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were other bits and pieces of evidence around, not all of which can be readily disclosed on the public record, which suggested that certainly as recently as four or five months ago this sort of support was occurring. I probably did not give sufficient weight&mdash;and I acknowledge this, as I did in the light of my discussion with Minister Thaksin&mdash;to the new determination which came over Thai policy really from June and particularly from July this year at the time the Cambodian government actually formally outlawed the Khmer Rouge. That gave the Thai government a new piece of weaponry in dealing with difficult elements in its own system. It has been much more forthcoming in terms of its activity now on the border. And Minister Thaksin, as one element in our conversation, announced after my discussion that he would escort or make available access by our ambassadors and other representatives from interested missions to go down there on the border now, which is something which has not previously happened, and see for themselves the scope and scale of the activity now being mounted to try to deal with this sort of border activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was given a number of other assurances relating to movement of personnel as well as movement of goods and money and, generally speaking, it was a very satisfactory conversation&mdash;certainly, as I began by saying, the best I have had on this subject and really quite encouraging. Under those circumstances and in order to help defuse what had become a difficult problem in bilateral terms and in domestic-political terms in Thailand, I was ready and willing to concede the point that perhaps I had been a little unfair in speaking as much as I did in the present tense given the changes that have occurred, manifestly, since July.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for the history lesson. But, really, we are interested in the basis upon which he made statements last week that were highly critical of Thailand, and his need, to the embarrassment of Australia&mdash;which is what is of concern&mdash;to withdraw those statements, acknowledging that perhaps he had spoken too strongly. What is the factual situation then, particularly when out of the country the minister said he could not give the sources of his information because it was intelligence-based? Now, apparently, he is saying he was out of touch. What exactly is the level of support being given by Thai military personnel to the Khmer Rouge? What does the minister now think will be the consequence of his mistake&mdash;a mistake he has had to acknowledge&mdash;bearing in mind what we heard this morning about possibilities of effects on trade?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the characterisation of what I said as a mistake. There has been a longstanding series of expressions of concern by many governments, many public spokesmen&mdash;including, I think, Senator Hill himself on numerous occasions&mdash;about the state of play and the porosity of the Thai border. And there are some continuing grounds for concern, certainly so far as some continuing business activity is concerned. But I am satisfied that a really major effort is now being made by the Thai government with appropriate enforcement mechanisms in place and I believe that there is a reasonable chance that we will not get a repetition, at least on the scale that has occurred in the past, of this sort of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and relates to his responsibilities for the Australian Antarctic Territory. Can the minister outline the principal outcomes from the 13th annual meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources held in Hobart last week? What role did Australia play in achieving these outcomes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2968" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the commission is to implement the objective of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources while allowing for the rational use of those particular resources. In previous commission meetings, Australia has been a significant conservation influence. This role was very successfully continued at this year's meeting on a wide range of subjects and, I might say, sometimes under very difficult circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was very active at the meeting and achieved some notable successes, which I would like to outline to the Senate. Australia played a leading role in suggesting ways to mitigate the incidental mortality of sea birds from fishing and took a strong stand on the need for major reductions in such mortality. This had a major effect on the design of conservation measures adopted by the commission for several fisheries and established precedence relevant to other fisheries forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Australian proposal to improve the procedure for notifying commission members of the results of inspections of fishing vessels, including any alleged infractions of commission conservation measures being committed, was accepted. This will greatly improve the speed with which members are given this information and allow earlier consideration of any ramifications of the alleged infractions and the need for further actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has submitted and gained acceptance for fisheries research data, gathered over three years, for the commission area that includes the Australian territory of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands. This is the first time that a party to the convention has produced the research data necessary for fisheries management before a fishery has commenced and our approach, I might say, was widely applauded. A proposal submitted by Australia seeking to increase the transparency of the procedure used to invite all types of observers&mdash;intergovernmental, non-governmental and state&mdash;was adopted by the commission. Australia also sought an end to the opposition by some commission members to environmental NGO participation at all commission forums and the placing of restrictions on those NGOs. Unconditional access was secured for environmental NGOs to the commission's scientific committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia also secured improved compliance with fisheries management measures. Australia made a presentation on the use of satellite transponders on fishing vessels to allow checking of vessels' positions from a land based monitoring centre, thus improving compliance with management measures. The commission has agreed in principle to the use of such a monitoring system in future in some fisheries, and a design of systems similar to those used in Australia will be submitted for consideration at the next meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important advances were also made in the development of assessment methods which take uncertainty into account in determining precautionary catch limits for fish and krill. These advances also resulted from work done by Australian scientists. I think these outcomes of the meeting are significant achievements for environmental protection in all of Antarctica and are further proof of Australia's effectiveness in working within international forums in protection of the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The Prime Minister has consistently stressed the urgent need for a national electricity grid in order to get competitive power prices to businesses around the country. Last Thursday the minister poured cold water on the grid proposal and claimed that `lower electricity prices could well result in greater energy consumption'. Were these remarks simply driven by the minister's insatiable appetite for personal grandstanding and a desperate need to pander to environmental extremists, irrespective of the consequences for business, or did the minister's remarks have the endorsement of the Prime Minister and cabinet? Does the minister support a national electricity grid and cheaper electricity prices for Australian industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

Does he mean by the particular audience which he was addressing or does he mean by the wider business community? Does he stand by that one sentence, which he obviously hoped would not be picked up by the wider community, or is the truth of the matter that his government has lost any stomach for micro-economic reform, has thrown in the towel on Hilmer and is now interested only in pandering to sectional interest groups, irrespective of the consequences for the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is just what the National Party needs&mdash;and certainly Senator O'Chee. If we read what Senator O'Chee has been saying, he has gone off the hook since Senator Bjelke-Petersen left. It is a terrible shame. Senator O'Chee has been running around North Queensland frightening families by giving very false information about the young homeless allowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee might listen: the truth is that across the whole of Australia the young homeless allowance is paid to only 300 young people under the age of 15, and 1,400 aged 15 receive the payment. I put that in for the sake of completion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee ignores the tragic reality that, while the great majority of parents fulfil their obligations, there are some cases of children and young people coming from places where they are physically or sexually abused. Senator O'Chee told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> that the young homeless allowance was splitting families in the small town of Ravenshoe and said, `In the past year I have realised the problem is getting worse.' The Senate will be interested to hear that the number of recipients of the young homeless allowance in that town has rocketed in the past year from zero to one! I do not know how Senator O'Chee can make a case on those sorts of figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure Australian families that, contrary to the very misleading and, I think, damaging remarks by Senator O'Chee, exactly the opposite is happening: children cannot walk into Social Security and pick up the young homeless allowance. The facts are that, before any payment of the allowance can be made, the claim must be verified. In a majority of cases, this means that parents are contacted. Where this is inappropriate because of the nature of the child's problems, the claims must still be verified, often with teachers, child protection officers, family, clergy or the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, under protocol arrangements in place with the states, the Department of Social Security refers state wards and young people who are homeless or at risk to the relevant state or territory department for an assessment of their circumstances and determination of the appropriate care and support arrangements. Parents are also able to provide information to the department at any time. This information must be taken into account when deciding whether to pay or continue to pay the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite want to be taken seriously, I think it is important that they tell the facts about the young homeless allowance, not their preferred version of scaremongering and anxiety. If Senator O'Chee knows any examples that are contrary to that, he should let me or Mr Baldwin and the department know. But what Senator O'Chee has said is absolutely wrong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was some rioting in East Timor over the weekend. It was essentially of an ethnic character, triggered by an incident in which an East Timorese man was killed by a trader from elsewhere in Indonesia, from Sulawesi, and that generated an explosive reaction from East Timorese locals. A number of civilians and businesses were subsequently attacked and it did turn into a fairly substantial riot, but not on the scale that was originally reported of 1,000 or more people being involved.

We had all hoped that it might be rather sooner than that. It looks like it is going to flow through into next year. But I am hopeful that some significant action of this kind will take place, because the Indonesian government realises that the problem is an intractable one; it is not going to go away unless some efforts of reconciliation of this kind have occurred. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

I refer the minister to his recent meeting with the Indonesian foreign affairs minister, Mr Ali Alitas, prior to the APEC meetings in Indonesia, and particularly to discussions at that meeting concerning `special status' for East Timor. I ask: given that Bishop Belo has stated that the East Timorese people will support `special status' only if it is a step towards self-determination, does the minister agree that `special status' should be seen as the first step for self-determination for East Timor, or is this just a cosmetic attempt to deal with the issue of East Timor and reduce international criticism?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bishop Belo is a very important figure in East Timor and his views certainly ought to be taken very seriously, but they do not necessarily represent the be all and end all and do not necessarily represent a practically workable solution. For example, Bishop Belo has recently gone on record as opposing the establishment of an Australian consulate in Dili, yet we have been asked on innumerable occasions by East Timorese representatives in Australia and many other members of the NGO community to press for that as an important and helpful step forward. So there are questions of judgment involved in this and I think we just have to pick our way through that rather than assuming that the words of any one leader or senior figure are necessarily decisive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-determination that Australia talks about and wants to encourage is self-determination within the framework of Indonesian sovereignty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-determination in that context, and in the way in which that expression is being used a lot internationally these days, does mean genuine respect for different ethnicity and genuine respect for human rights claims of particular groups within larger national or state entities. That is the kind of thing we are talking about. In that context, some kind of special political autonomy or special status&mdash;of the kind, for example, that exists in Jogjakarta or Aceh&mdash;might be thought to be helpful in that larger process of reconciliation. It is not by itself enough to solve the whole problem but it is at least part of the answer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> report of the Access Economics analysis. Apparently Senator Gibson has not read the closing paragraphs of this report, which say that Access Economics came to a prediction for economic growth in the out years of this current budget which is below that of the budget itself and, might I say, looking at the whole level of private sector predictions for budget growth, below that of what the private sector analysts would have as being the out years of budget growth. The reason that Access Economics has come to the conclusion that it does is, in my view, that it has underestimated the growth and strength in the Australian economy. As a consequence, it has come to a hole in the budget that does not exist. It has done that for the out years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy at the present time is growing strongly. Budget predictions were for a 4.3 per cent growth over this budgetary year. Private sector analysts now have the level of economic growth up around 5.5 per cent. There is nothing on the screen that would cause us in government to review&mdash;certainly not to review downwards&mdash;the level of economic growth that we expect for the out years in the budget. Therefore, we do not accept that the illusory hole, predicted to exist based on the estimates that Access Economics has come up with&mdash;which appear to be unsupported by other forecasting agencies&mdash;exists. As a consequence of not accepting its view of economic life, nor do we accept the implication in the question that Senator Gibson has put&mdash;that there is a bigger hole that we will somehow be struggling to fill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projections for the 1994 budget estimated the deficit for 1996-97 at O.9 per cent of GDP, with the budget to approach balance by 1997-98. This would be achieved by expenditure restraint in non-priority areas, causing outlays to fall as a percentage of GDP over the forward estimates periods; lower unemployment, reducing pressure on social security outlays; and projected growth in taxation revenue of 7.4 per cent in real terms in 1994-95 and 6.9 per cent in 1995-96, largely due to being driven up by higher growth in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Access Economics has forecast higher deficits in the out years, lower economic growth than forecast by the government at budget time, and higher public debt interest costs as a result of higher interest rates. Post-budget developments do not suggest that the deficit projections announced in the 1994-95 budget need to be revised upwards. Higher interest rates will certainly increase public debt interest costs, but faster employment growth since the budget will result in a lower than forecast expenditure on unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth forecasts for 1994-95 and later years which appear in the budget remain on track. GDP was forecast to grow by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, slowing to a growth rate of 4 1/4 per cent in 1995-96 and four per cent in 1996-97 and 1997-98. While the composition of growth in the 1994-95 period is likely to differ from that of the forecast at budget time, with a weaker farm sector and a stronger non-farm sector, overall developments since the budget suggest that the 4 1/2 per cent figure is achievable. As a consequence, it is interesting to see what Access Economics has written, but the government does not accept its viewpoint.</PARA>

There is little doubt that economic growth is strong and is continuing, with solid gains in production, sales, productivity, exports and, importantly, jobs across the board. While this must be welcomed, except by the negative people opposite, it has been evident in the past that many small to medium size firms are constrained during periods of growth by lack of patient development capital to fund their growth, yet the performance of these small but potentially high growth firms is crucial to the strength and sustainability of economic growth. Can the minister assure the Senate that the right policy settings are in place to encourage financial markets to direct capital to this vital part of the business sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is always looking for opportunities to improve the economic settings. One of the key drivers of economic growth is the availability of capital, and within that broad ambit is the availability of patient capital&mdash;patient capital for small to medium size businesses; patient capital that can be invested over a long period and where there may be a high risk but the potential of high return on that investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the approaches the government has adopted from a public policy point of view to improve the availability of patient capital for small to medium size businesses was set out in the One Nation statement in 1992, and that is for the establishment of pool development funds&mdash;funds which provide a lower tax level than otherwise obtains, but for money raised from the private sector for on-lending to small to medium size businesses. In the Working Nation white paper this year we reduced the tax level on pool development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in order to attract more private sector funding to small to medium size businesses in Australia and to provide a decent pool of patient capital for that sector of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we announced those changes, the number of pool development funds has almost doubled, from 10 to 19, and the amount of extra capital attracted into the economy to the end of June 1994&mdash;a very short time horizon between announcement and outcome in this case&mdash;was $35 million. We raised an extra $35 million for investment in small to medium size companies. But importantly, by the end of this year, pool development funds expect to raise $140 million in patient capital, the capital for small to medium size enterprises which will be in the market as a result of the settings we have now put into place for pool development funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that existing pool development funds are planning to raise up to $340 million&mdash;that is, an extra $340 million&mdash;in the longer term. By any measure this is a valuable contribution to the pool of capital available for the small to medium size companies which are, of course, the main engine of economic growth and future employment prospects for most Australians.</PARA>

I think the pool development funds are showing their worth to the economy by attracting funding at lower tax levels for small to medium size companies' growth.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues discussed&mdash;and the Australian delegation took a major role in this&mdash;related to how we can establish networking arrangements between SMEs across a number of countries to boost the access of those SMEs to markets so as to improve their economic prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other feature of the conference that we will certainly want to build on next year in Australia when we host the conference relates to several sessions when representatives of small and medium size enterprises from the various APEC countries participated in direct discussion with ministers in an open forum to exchange ideas. This proved very successful. For the conference here next year we are looking at arranging for a greater representation of practising SMEs to hold meetings, to hold discussions, to build up their own networks amongst APEC countries and, as well, to have the interaction with ministers about what are the issues for SMEs within the APEC region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly want to pay tribute here to the contribution of the Australian private sector. Various industry organisations in Australia, such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, were represented. They all made a significant contribution, and it is one reason that fellow APEC members recognised that Australia is the appropriate place to hold the next conference. I look forward to being involved in the hosting of that conference next year.</PARA>

<PARA>In so doing, I think it is pertinent to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that this is the Year of the Family, and yet the Department of Family Services persists unabated in giving the young homeless allowance to many young children who are certainly not in desperate need, who are certainly not being sexually or psychologically abused by their parents. It is a fact that this payment is causing widespread concern in the community, certainly no less so in Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a dorothy dixer, Senator Crowley tried to tell the Senate that I was scaring parents about the young homeless allowance. The young homeless allowance has been raised with me so many times this year that I have lost count. However, it is very clear that parents, headmasters and guidance officers at schools not just in Far North Queensland but right around this country are absolutely and thoroughly disgusted with the way in which this allowance is being handed out because, although Senator Crowley would have the Senate believe that there are all sorts of checks and balances on who is entitled to receive the allowance, the truth is definitely contrary to that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Crowley told the Senate that a person could not get the young homeless allowance unless his or her need was verified.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, that is true. But what sort of verification do students need before they can qualify for the young homeless allowance? That is the question I asked the Senate. That is the question I asked Senator Crowley, and Senator Crowley did not have an answer for it. She cannot answer it because she does not monitor properly what her department is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one case that was raised with me by a principal and a guidance officer at a school in Cairns, a young child had approached the guidance officer on a Monday&mdash;apparently it is normal at guidance offices on Mondays for there to be a line of children outside the door wanting to get the young homeless allowance&mdash;and the guidance officer had said no, she was not going to provide verification; no, she was not going to support the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did the child do? The child left the office and went shopping for other people to support the application for the young homeless allowance. It sufficed in this particular case that the child in question got a letter from the next door neighbour who said yes, he had heard arguments in the house next door over the weekend. What house in this country with a teenage son or daughter does not have arguments on the weekend? It is in the nature of being a teenager to argue with your parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact that a next door neighbour heard an argument next door does not mean that the child is being sexually abused and it does not mean that the child is being psychologically abused. It means that the child is having an argument with its parents. If that is sufficient to qualify for the young homeless allowance, then I am very concerned.

That leads the children to petty crime, and in this poor girl's case it led her to drugs and prostitution. That is what the young homeless allowance is doing. In many cases&mdash;</PARA>

This payment is a disgrace, the government is a disgrace, and Senator Forshaw's contempt of the concern of Australian families is a disgrace as well. Senator Forshaw might like to cease interjecting and listen to the truth. The truth is that this allowance is breaking up thousands of Australian families and that many of the children are not homeless&mdash;they just do not want to be at home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a re-run, Senator O'Chee. I am very pleased to take the opportunity in the few minutes provided to me here to suggest that Senator O'Chee is getting carried away. To suggest that the young homeless allowance is responsible for leading women to prostitution or to becoming drug addicts is an absolute scandal. What is Senator O'Chee's thesis? His thesis is that he wants to kick heads, really, I think. He actually goes a long way to stirring up and aggravating this confusion in the community about the young homeless allowance and whether or not teenagers can rock up&mdash;thousands of them, to quote Senator O'Chee in another scandalous piece of misinformation&mdash;to guidance officers. As I said to Senator O'Chee during my answer in question time, only 300 people under the age of 15 are on this young homeless allowance, and 1,400 people aged 15. That comes to 1,700 people, hardly Senator O'Chee's thousands of people rushing around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can check out the examples that Senator O'Chee gave, if he wants to be serious about it. If a child lines up on Monday to say to a guidance officer, `Will you say that I have had a rough time at the weekend over home?', the guidance officer says no and so the child looks for some other kind of support for the story&mdash;if that is all the evidence that is forthcoming, I would like to know a little more detail about it because any proper examination would find just what he said is the case: that arguments over the weekend are not unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need teenagers to have good arguments. And there can be arguments from Monday through to Friday too, but there may not be a neighbour at home to hear it so easily. Of course arguments happen but they would never be seen as sufficient justification for a child to walk out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator O'Chee wanted to say that getting the balance right is a very difficult matter I would take him very seriously. It is a very difficult matter and that is why the Department of Social Security has been concerned with this matter. I might say to Senator O'Chee that the social security department is not my department. I represent it here, and am very pleased and proud to do that, but he needs to be sure it is a social security department matter that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That department has listened over the years to evidence raised in estimates hearings. I well remember a very constructive meeting when the then Senator Walters, the then Senator Peter Baume, the then Senator Richardson and I discussed across the table the fact that families could not be reassured by the Department of Social Security that their children were okay because there was the matter of protecting the children's privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has examined the protocols and made absolutely sure that it has made them as tight and serious as it can. I think that, importantly, it has got the balance right in making sure that the children who are in need of support and protection are provided with it and that, at the same time, children who are having a spat with the family are not encouraged to take the first dollar and go. It is much more constructive&mdash;that is why I stand by my earlier comments&mdash;to find the facts and talk about them instead of whipping up a frenzy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the case Senator O'Chee raises has any substance and if he would like to bring it to the department, I will certainly see that the protocols are examined and, if anything further can be said about such a case, it will be followed up. I have no doubt about that at all. But to suggest that the young homeless allowance is leading to prostitution and drug addiction is a pretty wild and, I think, mischievous claim. It is not helpful to parents who might have a concern about what is best for their children and how they can be assisted in caring for them, particularly disputatious teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very concerning for government to know that there are children whose families do not provide them with protection, support, love or constructive arguments and which are a hazard to their children's wellbeing. The state department and the Commonwealth, through the Department of Social Security and this payment, need to assist those children and offer other support mechanisms to provide care for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be much better for Senator O'Chee to write back to the headmaster and tell him the facts of this matter, or pass the letter to me and I will seek an answer on it, rather than for him to go around saying, `Even he says we are inflaming passions.' That is not what he said. He said, `It is a matter of concern.' Indeed, if it is a matter of concern, let us sort it out instead of inflaming things. </PARA>

<PARA>In Senator Faulkner's answer, which related to my home state of Western Australia, he criticised the Western Australian government for not joining with other states in relation to the National Environment Protection Council. I wish to point out to the Senate that when that body was first thought of there was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism because it was thought that environmental laws should be uniform. However, as the states began to examine the matter more closely, it soon became readily apparent that, with Australia being the vast country that it is, the states have differing needs in relation to the environment and that the states' different geography and requirements had to be taken into consideration. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner recognised these different requirements. He said that the legislation would allow for different regions and states to have their needs taken into account. I believe the Western Australian point of view is that, if we do not need the NEPC, why join it? The Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, was the previous mechanism for achieving consistency throughout Australia&mdash;and that answers Senator Kernot's question. A mechanism is already in place for consistency throughout Australia, and that is ANZECC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would venture to say that the Western Australian view is that that body is able to do a good enough job without our having to have uniform laws across the country. This in turn says that we have to take each state's situation into account. Why have that legislation when it is not needed? It really goes to the efficiency of government and why we should make a law when it is not really needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a case of the state being obstinate and it is not about saying that this body is, in a ideological sense, something which is wrong or bad. It is more the practical argument that this body is not taking us any further and that ANZECC is a much more practical solution to the issue at hand. Therefore, I think Senator Faulkner's criticism of the Western Australian government is quite unjustified. We can argue this issue on ideological grounds as well, but Senator Faulkner was saying that the Western Australian government was acting entirely on ideological grounds and that it was throwing out something of use in favour of an ideological stance. That is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently there has been a compensation query in relation to the noise levels at Sydney airport. I wonder whether the minister has looked at whether this will have universal application across Australia in relation to airports. The situation in Sydney could well be different from that of, say, an airport at Broome, Western Australia. Does the minister, by his NEPC, envisage setting uniform requirements for compensation payouts? I bet that will be a pertinent question&mdash;one which might liven up the minister somewhat when we start talking about uniform compensation. Having regard to the government money which could be at stake, that is something about which the government would no doubt be most concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the issue at hand. It is not an ideological stance; it is really a practical stance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To remind honourable senators, we are dealing with the proposed amendment to section 191N(6) which refers to the tabling of the national indigenous land strategy in the parliament, allows for it to be disallowed and provides that whilst that period waiting for the disallowance is in train nothing can be done in relation to that strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell aptly summed up the position of the coalition on this point. Subsections (8) and (9) are proposed because one really does not get very far when one simply tables the strategy in the parliament without having some consequential action on it. If accepted, the people who are affected by this strategy would have some form of redress via their elected representatives, senators or members of parliament, to have it disallowed if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have to be a very serious matter indeed to have a majority disallowing the strategy; we fully appreciate that. One would not envisage a national strategy being disallowed, but the proposed amendment is there in case the strategy goes against the majority of thinking in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. If the feeling is that this strategy has missed the boat, there is an avenue of action that can be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that some other senators find proposed subsection (7)&mdash;that is, the tabling of the strategy&mdash;to be not such a bad idea. It does place it under some sort of purview. I do not think the government takes much issue with this proposed subsection either. A great deal of legislation has strategies and regulations which can be disallowable instruments, but the first thing is for it to come under the purview of parliament. We are proposing to take it that step further by making it a disallowable instrument in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though we are trying to hold up the implementation of the strategy; this is designed to give a second chance for comment by those who are intended to be the beneficiaries of this national strategy. And if we have that, it naturally follows that we have subsection (9)&mdash;that nothing should be acted upon something which could be disallowed. I do not think that in the normal course of events the delay would be that great. It is conceded that there is a possibility that there could be some delay if there were a break in time, such as over the Christmas break or the winter break. In the normal course of events that would not happen but I take that argument on board. That is the reason the coalition has inserted proposed subsection (9). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens have already put on the record that we are not intending to support proposed subsections (8) and (9) of opposition amendment No. 20. However, I did defend the opposition from some criticism that I felt it was getting, undeservedly, for even contemplating a disallowance capacity in regard to the tabling of the strategy. By that I did not mean to raise Senator Campbell's hopes. Had he given me a moment to speak on the last occasion we were considering the bill, I would have laid his hopes to rest. The Greens are not intending to support proposed subsections (8) and (9).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again I state quite clearly that because we feel that the ILC is very close to being a government body, even though it has the capacity to appoint five Aboriginal people of the seven people to be on that board, it is still too much of a government body for our liking. Because it is like a government body, it is appropriate for it to table its strategy and it is appropriate in some situations that that be considered a disallowable submission to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens do not support this amendment because with every amendment we have been trying to move the ILC away from being a government body so as to be more in line with Aboriginal people in the community. So we see supporting this amendment as actually reinforcing what we believe to be undesirable&mdash;that it should be a government board that is quite appropriately able to have its strategy disallowed or made a disallowable document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, even were we to give in on that point, we oppose the amendment because we do not believe that the parliament in its current imperfect form reflects the views of Aboriginal people in the community. Whether the parliament will ever do so is a debatable point. So our feeling is that the amendment would not allow more Aboriginal people to have access through the parliamentary system unless we radically altered our party political basis for decision making. That is the other reason we remain unconvinced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have said, we are happy to support the tabling of the national strategy document as a public information, on-the-record kind of measure that is very useful. We note that the government has already said that there are several parts of the bill that allow that to be widely disseminated on request, and that is commendable. Therefore, we do not feel it necessary to support the second and third parts of this proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not. Senator Chamarette and I have shared planes all around Australia as members of the native title committee. However, I do understand her concern&mdash;the Greens (WA) do want to try to make the ILC as independent as possible. I have thought of an example, which may not be a good example but it is the best I can do at the moment. I have in mind something like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank pre-privatisation, anyway&mdash;which have a requirement that their reports be tabled in the parliament. Since I have been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration the committee has called members of the board of the Commonwealth Bank before it and cross-examined them about their report. So even organisations as remote now as they are from the Commonwealth in terms of management and decision making can still be subject to public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Ellison makes is a good one: if the ILC comes down with a national strategy which does not reflect the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people, there is still no mechanism for Aboriginal people to have any effective control over or leverage against the ILC board. So I appeal to Senator Chamarette not to regard parliamentary scrutiny as some form of government intrusion into the ILC. Although the ILC is being made more dependent upon the Australian parliament, this is a way of actually making it less dependent upon the executive. I am appealing on the grounds that the parliament is not the executive, as Senator Chamarette knows better than most. The powers of the Commonwealth parliament, which are quite unique, can be used to make the ILC more independent from government. That is the basis of our appeal not just to support subsection (7) but also to support subsection (8). This would ensure that not only would the document be required to be tabled but also this parliament would be given the power to disallow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of disallowing it is basically to say, `Look, you've done the consultation that the parliament has imposed upon you. You've gone out and spoken to people.' I am reminded that Minister Tickner in particular and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have told this parliament that the government has gone through the widest consultation in the history of Australia in relation to this bill. Senator Chamarette has been told that; I have been told that. Those of us who have taken an interest in this bill know that that is not the case. The government has spoken to whom it wants to speak and heard what it wants to hear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that, even with the consultative provisions that we have put into this bill with the support of the committee&mdash;the fact that the board must now consult with Aboriginal groups and not just the ATSIC regional commission&mdash;it is still quite possible that the board would come up with a national strategy which did not reflect the hopes, aspirations and views of the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Island people that it seeks to serve. Through this mechanism&mdash;that is, requiring the strategy to be tabled and then giving the parliament the power to disallow&mdash;the real people that are being empowered are the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Island people and more scrutiny is being put on the ILC board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Harradine pointed out last Thursday, the fact of the matter is that the board is a government creation&mdash;the minister does have that power. We are saying that here is a nice effective check to enable Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people to say to the board, `You'd better listen to our views. Don't just consult with us but listen to us because if you don't and your national strategy doesn't reflect our views then we can go to people like Senator Chamarette, Senator Ellison, Senator Kernot and Senator Gareth Evans even and say we don't like this strategy. If you're not listening to our views then we'll ask people like Senator Chamarette, Senator Campbell or Senator Collins to disallow it.' That makes the board accountable to the people, actually reduces the links between the government and puts more power in the hands of the people. That is the effect of the amendment. So I would make one final plea for Senator Chamarette to reconsider her position on the second section of coalition amendment No. 20. </PARA>

It is still within the bill, and on that basis we can see why the Northern Territory, at least, would be very anxious regarding the failure to maintain the split between the $21 million going to ATSIC and the $21 million going through the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are to proposed section 192W and consequently omit a series: 193A, 193B, 193C, et cetera. Under the bill, the land fund is a trust account within the Commonwealth public account. As such, the fund is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth government. Investment of the money in the land fund is to be made by the Minister for Finance or his delegate within the Department of Finance or ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that the Indigenous Land Corporation should own and control the land fund in its own right. We see that the proposed structure of the land fund falls a long way short of the level of self-determination bestowed on Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory by the Fraser government in 1976 in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The New South Wales parliament passed legislation in the mid-1980s which allowed the New South Wales Land Council to manage a fund which will eventually be worth more than $500 million. That model of the New South Wales fund allowed 7 1/2 per cent of all land tax collected in the state to be available for investment and immediate funding over a 10-year period. It is a much better example of self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The less overt reason for the land fund being kept within the public account is so that it does not affect the budget deficit. If it is within the public account, then the government never has to come up with the billion dollars&mdash;not in one year and not even after 10 years. I think that is a myth being perpetrated in the media upon the public. They have been told repeatedly that Aboriginal people stand to gain a $1.4 billion fund. I think it is time to lay that to rest, not just in the community and in the media but also in the legislation. If the $1.4 billion never leaves the public account and stays in consolidated revenue so that it never upsets in the slightest bit&mdash;except by $45 million a year&mdash;the budget deficit, then it is not a fund being given to Aboriginal people or to the ILC: it is a government fund. All that happens for the ILC is that it actually has an expropriation from that government money of $45 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government can win both ways. It cannot say, `We're giving $1.4 billion to Aboriginal people under this fund,' and on the other hand say, `But we're not affecting our budget deficit much at all, only by $45 million a year.' If the government is to have a $1.4 million fund, it should give it to the right people and not continue with this pretence. As we know, all that the ILC is coming up with each year is $45 million&mdash;and even $21 million of that is old money&mdash;so the budget deficit will only be affected by $24 million a year out of a total deficit that is expected to be $12 billion. So we believe very strongly that the focus of these amendments is to try to give that control and self-determination principle to the ILC so that it has got the capacity to look at the way in which the money is invested, look at the possible earnings and have a much greater say in it than is currently allowed for under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say one more thing before I open the debate up to my colleagues to comment on this factor. The government might argue&mdash;in fact, I have heard it argue&mdash;that it gives Aboriginal people certainty. I think that is true&mdash;it will. I have even heard the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, say that it will be a great shame if this bill does not pass because Aboriginal people will not then be locked into this wonderful $1.4 billion fund. I want to make it quite clear on the public record that there is a very good reason that Aboriginal people should not be locked in to an increase of $24 million a year, which is meant to meet the justice requirements of the Prime Minister's purpose for this fund, which is to redress the dispossession of all Aboriginal people or at least the 95 per cent who do not stand to gain by native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a political reason for this locking in and that is that it takes the land acquisition needs of the Aboriginal community off the agenda for 10 years. So, politically, it may be high risk if it is not locked in but, on the other hand, for Aboriginal people it is an extremely high risk if it is locked in because it allows very little chance of increase. So what we get is the lowest common denominator. Why should the Aboriginal people forever be locked into the lowest common denominator of $45 million a year by this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, if the amendments that we will be considering later in the `A' series are taken seriously by the government and the quantum is actually increased, the Aboriginal community could stand to gain by having something favourable locked in. But to lock in something that is $21 million a year is a disgrace. That is why these amendments seek to give the control of the money and the land fund to the ILC. </PARA>

Given that we know that that is a political reality, I think it is very unlikely that future governments will place a high priority on a land fund. If we were to defeat this bill, I think it very unlikely that future governments would re-visit this debate. While I agree that this money is a very, very small amount to redress what is needed by way of compensation for dispossession&mdash;I do not know whether we have got enough anywhere in this country to do that&mdash;given that we are getting a 10-year appropriation, a small appropriation, I cannot agree that it is worse than nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put the coalition's position on the record. In reality, much of what Senator Chamarette said is right. What has really been achieved in the world of political reality, which is the world of political perception, is that the government has created in the minds of people and Aboriginal people a $1.4 billion fund. I congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, for the deception they have created in the minds of the people of Australia. When we go out into the communities&mdash;we sometimes get let loose on the weekends, or when the bells ring on Thursdays and we get let out for a few hours&mdash;and talk to real people, the perception is that this land fund is a $1.4 billion fund. So I congratulate Mr Tickner and Mr Keating for being politicians in the worst sense of the word, for being Goebbellian politicians, because they have achieved something incredible&mdash;they have achieved the perception in the Australian community that there is a $1.4 billion land fund.</PARA></TALK.START>

Firstly, for those people in the community who believe that Aboriginals get too much already, that the money is wasted, and who say, `Why should we give Aboriginals something that white people can't get,' of course, it is a good can to kick. For redneck people who want to kick the Aboriginal can, it gives them a nasty, almost racist can to kick. Secondly, for the Aboriginal people and those who care about trying to do something to redress both their dispossession and their disadvantage, it is a hoax because, as has been pointed out by Senator Chamarette and Senator Kernot in two different ways, what this bill effectively does is to appropriate $24 million a year. It does not appropriate $45 million; it appropriates $24 million. As I have pointed out on a couple of occasions, that is roughly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality, from the coalition's point of view, is that we have looked very carefully and long and hard at this concept of keeping it inside the public account or putting it outside the public account. We remain unconvinced that taking it outside the public account will help Aboriginal people. I think that is the point that Senator Collins has made.

We have said, as has been widely reported, that we have some preconditions, but I must say for the record that many of our amendments have received government and even Democrat support&mdash;I should not say that; I should say that they have received unanimous support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of the comments that have been made and to note that we are discussing two issues. I think I may have strayed a little in getting on to the amount because basically the aim of amendment D1 is that `the land fund is a fund under the control and management of the Indigenous Land Corporation'; is to be kept `separate and distinct from any other account, recording payments into and out of the fund'; and `so far as practicable, money in the land fund that is not required for the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation must be invested, but may not be invested other than in the manner for the time being authorised by an act or a state or territory act for the investment of trust funds.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do think it is an interaction effect with the paltry amount of money, the major point of these amendments is that the money is essentially not in the control of the ILC. So it is a structural amendment that asks why they should not have the right to determine the investment and the capacity of that fund. The models that we feel are superior to that are those put in place in 1976 in the Northern Territory, where there is an advisory committee for the trust account that gains money as a result of the Northern Territory land rights act. The trust account is operated with ministerial approval of payments. The minister is advised by the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee, of which the minister appoints the chairperson and the land councils elect the 14 members. That committee has the receipt of income, which is royalty equivalents, interest earned on its own investments and other minor receipts, and it is able to allocate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total of royalty revenue equivalents passed on to the trust account in 1993-94 was a little over $32 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the New South Wales Land Council's fund, it has the responsibility to receive the 7 1/2 per cent of land tax each year and to invest 50 per cent for the benefit of a self-sustaining fund in 10 years time, and it has the capacity to distribute and allocate the other 50 per cent of revenue it receives each year. The structure is an important one and I think that needs to be supported as the main reason for this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the other comments that were made, Senator Collins said that the benefit is indisputable for those Aboriginal people who are the sole beneficiaries of this fund. What I would want to say there is that it may well be in the interests of those who end up being the beneficiaries. The problem is that there is a vast percentage of Aboriginal people who will never be beneficiaries of this fund, because of the amount. Therefore, it is not necessarily a good structure that we are putting in place because the government is actually keeping the bulk of the funding within the public account and not distributing it. Nor is it allowing Aboriginal people and the ILC to have a say in the investment of that so-called $1.4 billion. Each year we are not allowing them to invest the $200 million or $121 million, depending which year, to maximise the expropriation that they might be able to receive. That is the link with the amount. Because they have so little, if they had more say in the money that is being kept in the public account, that is, the $200 million that is there this year and the $121 million that is in that public account for the next nine years, they would be able to maximise their return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the committee hearings we heard some very interesting testimony from J.P Morgan that the fund is diminishing because it is being kept in the public account and that it would be possible, if the investment was diversified, to increase the amount by which Aboriginal people could benefit. That is another major reason for allowing the money to be outside the public account and for the ILC to be able to control the way in which it generates income, which will then be available to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot said that if we defeat this bill future governments will not do it. She also said that history tells us that if we do not take action now we get nothing. There is one flaw in that. History also tells us that governments tend to get away with as little as possible. Once they have put in place and locked in as little as possible, it is extraordinarily difficult to get them or any other government to increase it. We always get a lowest common denominator. We get: `What can we get away with giving&mdash;the minimum amount with the least disruption.' Then forever after, because the political capital has gone to make that change, further improvements are so unlikely as to be wishful thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this government has a responsibility, because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said so. He has said that it is part of his major financial contribution, as a result of the Mabo High Court decision, towards amelioration of the dispossession of Aboriginal people of this country. If this is the major proportion, heaven help Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we put this bill in place and we then allow the government to rest on its laurels, because with this structure and with this amount of money it has quite a good deal, then no doubt it will never do anything again. It has not made any commitment to increase its action on this particular bill and it will be able to gloat over its human rights stand internationally as though it has actually met its human rights obligations to the indigenous people of Australia. So I think there is a very important reason why we should not say, `This is the best thing and it should be put in place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will talk about the gold medal plan that Senator Campbell raised. I think it is not entirely a coincidence. It might not have been a deliberate intention of the government, but I think it portrays a subconscious attitude that $21 million actually is the unit of nothing appreciable at all to affect the budget deficit. We can give $21 million a year to our Olympic athletes as part of the gold medal plan&mdash;believe me, I am not asking that that be reduced&mdash;but I think it is the smallest unit that can escape out of the budget allocations without causing disruption. It should be noted that that is the same amount that is being allowed to escape to Aboriginal people to redress the injustice of 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that these things are entirely unrelated;  they are not simply equivalent units. It is enormously useful to the government to provide funding of $21 million as the gold medal plan for our athletes in preparation for the Olympic games, and it is enormously useful to this government to provide Aboriginal people with a land fund, into which they are locked, of $21 million a year. When there is protest at the Olympic games over Australia's failure to address the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country, that will be rebuffed by the government being able to say, `Oh, no, we have you locked in. We have given you all the redress that you are going to get.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe I am being overly cynical, but I am afraid there is an accuracy in what I am saying. This small amount of money over the next 10 years, which the ILC has no ability to increase, is supposed to silence the protests and pleas of the Aboriginal peoples who will not be sole beneficiaries of the fund in any way, shape or form, nor will they have any say in how it is being allocated or in how the investment earns an increase. </PARA>

The government insists that the money is placed in superannuation management funds which are then managed by the superannuation industry.

The minister, in fact, makes the decisions about where that money goes. There are some delegations to the advisory committee by the minister, but they are at his discretion. The minister can determine from time to time what levels of reserves have to be kept in that account. There was a period not so long ago where very few disbursements were made from the ABTA. The minister controls it completely and is the decision maker for it. So I cannot understand that reference at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that on page 32 of this bill there is a reference in clause 193G(1) to a meeting convened by the minister at least once each financial year&mdash;I think there are some proposed amendments from the Democrats to this section&mdash;a meeting of various people that the minister puts together, as he does the ABTA advisory committee, to advise on the investment policy of the fund. It would be very similar in its nature to the way in which the ABTA currently operates with its advisory committee, with the minister having the final decision making role which, of course, is dramatically not the case in respect of what is being proposed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental reason for the government placing this fund in the public account is to ensure maximum security for the fund. That is unblushingly the case. As part of the public account, this fund will be governed by certain provisions of the Audit Act that protect Commonwealth moneys. The range of investments permitted under section 62B of the Audit Act is limited to more secure forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a risk of capital losses from the fund if it is invested in less secure instruments&mdash;and I might add that this was a matter of some prolonged debate in cabinet consideration of this issue. If that were allowed, it could in the long term jeopardise the viability of the fund. The bottom line at this time is that the fund is being placed in the public account essentially to ensure the maximum security for the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I take considerable exception to the dismissive way in which the amount of money under this fund is dealt with. This amount of money is provided simply for the specific purpose of providing additional benefit to the Aboriginal people of Australia. What annoys me about the references that have been made by Senator Chamarette and others is that they have referred to the fund as if it were the only measure of financial assistance to Aboriginal people. Entirely fallacious and flawed comparisons have been made with gold medal assistance to Olympic athletes and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that government outlays for the benefit of Aboriginal people, which this government provides and strongly supports, are in the order of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year. ATSIC alone receives, from memory, in the order of $900 million a year at this time&mdash;and it will escalate in future budgets&mdash;which is disbursed for the benefit of Aboriginal people. DEET, for example, currently gets around $300 million a year in terms of specific training programs for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The state and Commonwealth housing arrangements, with which I am also familiar, currently provide in the order of $100 million a year for housing&mdash;I think it is $95 million, to be precise&mdash;for the benefit of Aboriginal people. The total sum currently being expended, in rough terms, is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in existing outlays of public money a year&mdash;which this government provides and strongly supports&mdash;for the benefit of Aboriginal people. So those comparisons are sadly flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amount of money, which I think has been carefully considered by the government in terms of its quantum, is in addition to that very significant amount of government support, for the benefit of Aboriginal Australians, that is already provided. The bottom line, in respect of the public account&mdash;I might add that the ABTA is operating within the public account&mdash;is fundamentally to provide the maximum security for the fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for clarifying that. I was not totally familiar with the process. I did like the increased level of Aboriginal community input to the ABTA and the fact that it has regional representation on its board, something the ILC cannot have because it has a board of only seven people. There cannot be representation to the same degree as the ABTA advisory committee has with 14 elected members. We can see they have greater input. I was in error in assuming that their say in regard to the investment of the money was somehow greater or different from that proposed for the ILC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still would say that it is a matter of concern. I would like the government, through the minister, to say how the figure of $200 million that remains in the public account&mdash;and the $45 million to be expropriated&mdash;was determined. How did the government choose that amount to remain in the public account and how did it choose the $1.4 billion that remains in the public account? If the government has been publicising that it is a $1.4 billion fund for Aboriginal people, how has it justified the fact that the $1.4 billion is all in the public account? I would like some answers to that. Also, what is the government's position on the effect on the deficit if the $200 million&mdash;or a greater amount&mdash;was able to be outside the public account or was somehow available to the ILC in terms of control of the investment?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple answer to those questions is that the $200 million was a start up for the fund. That global amount was set in a way the government sets all these dispersals of public money. Unfortunately, we do not have the facility that the Greens have; which is not having to worry about putting budgets together&mdash;basically just printing the stuff for everybody who asks for it. We do not have available to us the magic pudding approach to budgets. I assure Senator Chamarette that the global amount was considered after lengthy consideration by the government as to the total budgetary commitments that it has.

<PARA>This motion now before us, of which notice was given last week, deals with quite a complicated matter with a long history. It is one of rather fundamental importance for effective administration in this country. I would like to say to Senator Harradine and members of the opposition who are interested in this that I want to do three things. First, I want to give an account of the history of this matter. In doing so, I want to make it clear that there has been no deliberate backtracking or bad faith on the part of this government, notwithstanding some suggestions to that effect that apparently had been made. Secondly, I want to explain why it is that the government supports the motion, of which notice was given last week and which is now in front of us. Thirdly, I want to address the question of what happens if this motion I have now moved is not agreed to by the Senate. I want to do all those three things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the history of this matter, I think the course of events needs to be appreciated if there is not to be some perpetuation of misunderstandings here. Things began back on 16 December 1993 when Senator Harradine gave notice in the Senate that he would move a motion stating:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That there be laid on the table by the Leader of the Government . . . of the budget sittings 1994 . . . an indexed list of every file . . . held by each Commonwealth Department, grouped under classifications such as policy, legislation, advising, general matters, administration or such other classifications as are most commonly used across departments;</PARA>
<PARA>There was a further qualification, however, that that list was not to contain `any information which would disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security information.' Although qualified in character, nonetheless, the motion proposed by Senator Harradine was of enormously broad ambit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 March 1994 in the context of a rather lively debate we were then having on another matter to do with government ministerial accountability, as part of the government's response to that debate&mdash;I quote from page 1454 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 3 March&mdash;I announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, motion No. 544, notice of which was given by Senator Harradine on 16 December 1993. That motion would require publication by way of tabling in parliament of departmental file titles relating to policy matters, legislation and the like.</PARA>
<PARA>So I gave a clear-cut undertaking in this parliament that we would support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, Senator Harradine's motion. That detailed discussion then took place. It was a protracted process, and it involved a lot of discussion between me and Senator Harradine and our respective offices. That culminated, in terms of the documentary trail, in a letter that I wrote to Senator Harradine on 27 June 1994 proposing a motion in terms that were attached to the letter, which was certainly not a comfortable position for the government to adopt. I was well aware that, within the government, there was a great deal of reservation and concern about the practicability of that commitment. But I took the firm view with Senator Harradine that I was obliged by the undertaking that I had given and wanted to act in good faith and to do so particularly before the Senate got up at the end of that session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the following day, 28 June, just before we rose, the motion that was moved in the terms which I had conveyed to Senator Harradine in that letter was in fact agreed to by the Senate. The motion provided for a two-tranche commitment to be made by the government. The terms of that motion, I suppose, are most clearly referred to in the appendix to the Senate committee report, which report I will refer to in more detail in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular motion that was passed provided in the first place that not later than 10 October 1994 an indexed list of the titles of all relevant files created between January and June 1994 be tabled. The second tranche provision related to files created between June and December 1994. They were to be tabled not later than the end of the first week of the first sittings in 1995. Those were the terms of the motion that was passed by the Senate. They were the relevant dates that were set in that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That resolution, however, was referred on a motion by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the opposition to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for consideration and report. There was manifest concern on the part of at least some spokesmen or senior members of the opposition that maybe this whole files business may be unworkable. At that stage maybe members of the opposition were thinking that they might be in government at some stage in the future and were worried about the implication of this kind of extremely intrusive resolution. In any event, since there was time between June and the first reporting date of October&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For whatever reason, the motion adopted was in fact referred to the committee for report. That took place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I want to draw honourable senators' attention to the terms of that government submission because they are relevant to this question of good faith and whether or not the government has behaved in a consistent fashion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will read the first two paragraphs because they are the key ones. Paragraph 59 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's agreement not to oppose Senator Harradine's motion (in its amended form) was based on the understanding that there was majority support for it, related as it had been to the accountability package debated in the Senate on 3 March.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 60, which immediately follows, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that, notwithstanding the difficulties identified in this Submission, the majority support continues, the Government will make its best endeavours to comply with the terms of the order, noting that it is essentially a trial arrangement to be reviewed in 1996 when a more considered assessment of the value of the information provided and of the costs and any problems associated with providing it can be made.</PARA>
<PARA>In the remaining paragraphs of that conclusion we went on to point to the nature of the concerns which had been expressed by departments, suggesting that, in the light of those concerns, the committee might wish to consider, having regard to these various views, a different approach than simply adopting the order in its original terms. I refer to paragraph 60 because that was a clear statement from the government&mdash;in fact, it was endorsed by the cabinet&mdash;that, in the event that majority support for Senator Harradine's motion continued, the government would make its best endeavours to comply with the terms of the order. That position still holds, and I will come back to that point a little later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what was said by us in making our submission to the committee. I will not go into the substantive content of the submission; I will summarise that briefly in a moment. I just want to get the history of this clear. On 20 September the committee reported. This was a committee which had three government and three opposition members. The report was unanimous. There was no minority report; it was a unanimous report. The conclusions of the committee&mdash;again, without going to the reasoning&mdash;were threefold. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the order of 28 June 1994 be revoked;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.the Government give notice of an appropriate substitute motion which would implement a trial production of indexed lists of departmental files for two departments for six months; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.the trial not involve any retrospectivity and exclude appropriate classes of confidential files as suggested by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>So in its report the committee is saying, `Put aside the original motion'&mdash;even though it was agreed to in the Senate back in June&mdash;`Don't try and track back retrospectively and produce lists of files for the past', which would be unworkable, costly and time consuming, `but start now and produce some for the future. Don't do it across the whole range of departments. Just take two selected departments and do this on a trial basis. Then we will come back and look at it again on the basis of that trial experience.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the committee reported. Senator Kemp was on the committee. Senator Watson&mdash;who is much respected in this place for his approach to administrative matters as well as his indefatigable determination to keep the government honest&mdash;was also on the committee. And Senator Campbell, who is in the chamber at the moment, was on the committee as well. They all put their names to this report; it was a unanimous recommendation. And, I believe, it was a good faith recommendation with everyone understanding that it was stepping back from something that the government&mdash;and the Senate&mdash;had agreed to do. Nonetheless, it was a stepping back in light of the accumulated weight of the evidence that was before the committee as to how all this might work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 October, which was the reporting date in the original motion&mdash;procedurally, something had to happen in the Senate by that date&mdash;there was agreement in the chamber to actually amend the original motion to put a date of 10 November rather than 10 October. I think it should be frankly and honestly acknowledged around the chamber that this was simply a device to defer the whole question for a month while the government drafted the trial motion that had been recommended by the committee. The government could not do that immediately because there had to be consultations within the government as to which two departments would have the honour of bearing this particular responsibility. It was a tricky issue to resolve and it was going to take time. We told people that in the consultative process that occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that Senator Harradine was especially comfortable with all of this because he saw us moving backwards from the original terms of the recommendation, but others in the chamber&mdash;particularly the opposition&mdash;were comfortable with that, and on those terms. I believe it was understood around the chamber that the purpose of substituting that date was simply to defer the debate for a month. I think it is also reasonable to say that there was an expectation&mdash;certainly on the government's side&mdash;that the majority that had made itself clear in the committee would hold up on the floor of the Senate and that there would accordingly be support in this place for a trial process of the kind recommended by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of October the government had resolved which department would do this trial: my own department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was to be one, and the Department of Social Security was to be the other. The Department of Social Security is a large operating department with a lot of practical program delivery dimensions as well as some policy dimensions. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is a large policy oriented department. We thought that this was a fairly reasonable spread which would give us an indication of how workable this system would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of October people were given advice of the government's intentions in this respect. Last week, on 8 November, I moved the motion that is now before us which provides for the revocation of the original June order and provides for a trial exercise on a prospective basis of the two departments concerned. We were ready to debate that motion the following day, 9 November, before the formal time for the production of documents under the original order fell due. Last week, the opposition asked for more time to consider its position on this. Although that produced some technical difficulties about us being in breach of the Senate order, we were happy enough in all the complicated circumstances of this matter to grant that extension of time. Thus it is that the matter comes on for debate today rather than last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the history of the matter, as objectively and as frankly as I can describe it, with all the instances of what occurred along the way. As to the arguments for the motion in the terms in which I have moved it and as it is before us on the notice paper, let me just say fairly succinctly these things. The committee was asked by the Senate to examine a number of specific issues: whether the order in its original form would in fact produce material which was in a user-friendly form for senators and others; the practicality of implementing the order; the cost of carrying it out; the implications of the order for Commonwealth departments; and whether any more efficient and effective method might be devised to achieve the objectives of the order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manifestly, the terms of reference were sympathetic to the idea behind the order, but nonetheless they sought a pretty wide ranging review of its practicalities, both from a Commonwealth department's point of view and from a user's point of view. The government, as I say, provided a considered submission to the committee which, in the substantive part, pointed out that there were serious practical and other difficulties. We identified difficulties relating to the number of files involved, the usefulness of file titles, the ability of departments to implement the order in the time scale outlined if retrospectivity were required, and there were also serious concerns about the availability of certain classified material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the committee&mdash;it says so in its report&mdash;found the government's submission persuasive and shared its concerns over these practical and other difficulties. The committee particularly felt that the retrospectivity involved in the earlier order would not easily be workable and that the order should be modified so that it had an entirely prospective application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also shared the government's concerns about the possible damage that could arise from premature disclosure of material relating to policy initiatives, and that a government was entitled to have its departments develop policy advice in confidence. The committee also agreed with the government's submission that provision of the information of the kind sought would probably not be of much practical benefit to the parliament, and that the cost and resource implications of the exercise under those circumstances could not be reasonably justified. I think that is a fair summary of the basic thrust of that committee report which, as I say, is signed by Senator Kemp, Senator Watson and Senator Campbell as well as the three government senators. There were no minorities and no majorities about this; it is the unanimous considered recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did go further, however, than the government's submission and recommend that a limited trial should occur. The committee was not prepared just to say, `No, don't go on with this'. It said, `No, you should have a go at making this work,' proposing that it should, however, be prospective rather than retrospective, and that it should exclude certain classes of files. The committee considered that it should apply to only two departments and operate for a period of six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government's motion now before the Senate is intended exactly to give effect to those unanimous recommendations of the committee, embracing both the opposition and the government. If we look at the terms of the resolution on the notice paper we will see that paragraph (1) revokes the previous order; paragraph (2) establishes the new limited trial and provides that on the first day of the 1995 Spring sittings, which is currently scheduled to be 22 August, the Leader of the Government is to table lists of files created during the first six months of next year in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Social Security; paragraph (3) provides for the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to evaluate the success of the trial as envisaged by the former standing committee; and paragraph (4) provides for a series of definitions, most of which go to describing the kinds of files which are to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am extremely conscious that this motion does not go as far as Senator Harradine would have liked. It is certainly not as extensive in its scope as the order that was agreed to at the end of June. But it does represent an honest attempt to come to grips with some of the immense practical difficulties involved in making this work in a way that is not just manageable for governments&mdash;that is only one side of the equation&mdash;but also in a way that is actually helpful to users, that is, people embarking on an exercise of finding out what government is up to and addressing their minds to policy issues and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the motion is eminently reasonable in its terms. I think it is fair enough for me to say that two big and serious departments are involved, not just small and marginal departments. We get ample opportunity to look at the range of issues that are thrown up by this sort of administrative exercise. There will be ample opportunity to evaluate and make a decision as to whether this should continue on a more comprehensive basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Senate can respond seriously to the kinds of points that I make. I could go on at much greater length about the terms of the government's worries about this&mdash;the terms of the Senate committee report&mdash;but I think I have perhaps said almost enough to make that clear. However, I should say something about what the government's position will be in the event that I have not succeeded in persuading the Senate and it does not want to revoke the original order and does not want to support this proposal for a trial period that has been put by the committee. If that is the case, I am forced back on the undertaking given in the submission put to the committee. I do not propose to resile from that. I will repeat paragraph 60, which is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that, notwithstanding the difficulties identified in the Submission, the majority support continues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, the majority support for the original order&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government will make its best endeavours to comply with the terms of the order, noting that it is essentially a trial arrangement to be reviewed in 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. So we will make our best endeavours to comply with it. There is an obvious difficulty in complying with the order in the terms in which it is expressed at the moment, because the date for doing so has already passed&mdash;even the original date of 10 October for the first tranche and now the second date, 10 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say frankly that we cannot comply even this week, or next week or the week after, with this because the work simply has not been done. The reason the work has not been done is that for the last couple of months at least, since the committee has reported and, indeed, when it was known from talking to people what their likely views were, a reasonable judgment was made that something at least would come out of the committee report which would be different from that which was in the original motion. Under those circumstances, work has been put on hold for this. It has not been put on hold in my own department&mdash;we have been gearing up to do it, and Social Security similarly&mdash;but in the other departments it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, there will be a very real difficulty in meeting quickly any requirement for retrospective tabling. I would accordingly have to ask that those dates be further amended. I hope we could be given till the first sitting week of next year for the first tranche being sought and, for the second tranche, maybe six weeks or so after that&mdash;the latter part of March&mdash;as a realistic time frame for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the nature of the problems the departments are experiencing and why it is a practical necessity to have this amount of time, I refer honourable senators to paragraph 29 of the government's submission to the committee, which goes specifically to the question of the practicality of implementing the order in its original terms. There are lots of other parts of the submission that go to cost and to the utility of the information thus derived, but paragraph 29 goes to the question of practicality. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of departments would be able to comply with the order if its application were to be delayed until appropriate  changes were made to records management systems software. Even so, further consideration would be needed of the nature of the classes of files excluded from the list (eg Cabinet, security classified and commercially sensitive files) and manual checking of titles would still be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>It gives some detail in support of that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">eight departments commented that the suggested categories system is inappropriate. Most departments have their own indexing systems which allows them to locate files by subject at a far more detailed level or on a different basis (eg work units) than the classifications proposed. In addition, many files would appear in at least two out of three categories (were the suggested classifications to be adopted) since policy and legislative matters, and commonly advisings, will often be contained on one subject-matter file;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the point is made:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">eight departments noted that the inclusion of files already created, and the excision of sensitive information from file titles would need to be done manually, and in most cases by officers of appropriate experience and/or seniority to make judgments on individual files, and information contained in file titles. Most of these departments noted that this would be costly and time consuming, and would divert resources away from normal operations. It may be that if class file exemptions could be made most of this work could be undertaken electronically, with only a manual final check;</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate there, however, that we are not in a position of having such class exemptions, only the very broad ones that I have already mentioned. The submission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">five departments noted that compliance with the order could only be achieved with system changes of varying degrees of magnitude, or consultant assistance;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">two departments noted that there could be security concerns in complying with the order although it is possible that these could be alleviated were files with a national security classification to be excluded;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">one department suggested that there should be additional file class exemptions to the order to protect commercially sensitive information affecting the department itself.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a measure of the particular practical problems that are going to be experienced right now. The retrieval systems are simply not in place just to press electronic buttons and get the results wanted. The classification systems do not coincide with the ones in the terms of the resolution. It is just not the way departmental files are organised. To go back retrospectively for files that were not created with this disclosure exercise in mind is an inordinately time-consuming business. It is for these reasons that we wanted to do it&mdash;if we were going to do it at all&mdash;prospectively rather than retrospectively, so that at least people could develop systems that would enable the information to be readily retrieved. That is the nature of the problem. That problem is a stark one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to go down the path of meeting Senator Harradine's terms of the original order in a matter of days or even a few short weeks would simply be impossible. The time frame I have mentioned is one that takes into account the original time frame in the original motion. The motion was passed at the end of June. The report date was 10 October. I am not asking for a full four months in this instance, but I think we need at least nearly 2 1/2 months to be able to do the job properly&mdash;taking into account the reasonable expectations people had that they would not be confronted with this kind of obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to have been so long-winded about this but I think it is necessary, given the heat that this seems to be engendering in some quarters and the misunderstanding it is engendering in others, for me to make very clear that the government really has tried to act in good faith throughout on this, but it has been an intractable set of practical problems that we have been wrestling with. I had not appreciated the magnitude of those practical problems when I made the original undertaking to Senator Harradine back in March. I sensed that there were going to be a few and that is why I was careful to say `subject to detailed consideration of drafting difficulties'. I made clear to Senator Harradine that there were going to be some problems about that. There was a reservation or a qualification made in good faith, and I hope that Senator Harradine does not feel that he was dealt with in bad faith over the months that followed when we tried to wrestle with the terms of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not our proposal or idea to refer it to a committee; that came from the other side of parliament. We, in making a submission to that committee, made it clear that, while we felt there were some agonising practical difficulties involved in implementing it, nonetheless we would make a best-endeavours effort to do so in the event that the committee was not persuaded by those practical difficulties. The committee came out with the unanimous report which embraced those practical concerns and suggested a reasonable course of action which we are now prepared to embrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know Senator Harradine will be a bit disappointed about it and think it is a step backwards&mdash;he has said so quite robustly to me on several occasions&mdash;but I hope that he will accept at least that I and the government have been trying to act in good faith and that it is just an inherently difficult issue. I hope that some good sense will prevail and the opposition will follow the judgment of its own committee members, who have had more time to look at this issue than perhaps anyone else in the chamber apart from those of us immediately involved. I recommend the terms of the motion to the Senate accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not my agenda at all. I would have thought, and I felt at the time, that this was a matter that would have been the agenda of a person like the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, who has had a marvellous track record of verbal support of open government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was most heartened when, after discussions in March, an undertaking was given by Senator Evans in the terms that he has outlined today. In the month that followed there was discussion. It is no good saying that there was not discussion with other departments&mdash;there were discussions between Senator Evans's office and other departments. What emerged, finally, in June was not my motion but a motion, the terms of which were agreed to specifically by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I would have thought that was it. I was very pleased because I felt that that was an advance towards open government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans would not have been surprised when I found that the government's submission to the Senate committee looking at the Freedom of Information Act said that the act is concerned with the principle of open government; that it does not prescribe government in the open. That is an extraordinary Sir Humphrey statement. I believe that the Senate will find the nicety of such a metaphysical distinction of no practical benefit at all. Maybe the government itself might wish to explain what that means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have the opportunity to advance the principle of open government which the Leader of the Government has supported for some considerable years. Indeed, the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its issues paper No. 12 of September 1994 on freedom of information, refers to the motion that was adopted by this Senate in June. The ALRC states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electoral Administration Review Commission in Queensland addressed the need for information about its files by providing a publicly accessible database of its files. Other approaches include publishing file lists in the Government Gazette or several times a year in separate digests that would be available at public libraries or through AGPS in hard copy or on disc.</PARA>
<PARA>That was after the statement by the ALRC that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 8 and 9 ensure that the public is provided with a certain amount of information about the documents agencies hold. This information may not always be sufficiently detailed to assist FOI applicants to identify particular documents. The difficulty is probably greatest for documents that do not contain the applicant's personal information. Concern has been expressed in Parliament that lack of information about agency files causes applicants to incur unnecessary search and retrieval expenses and thereby makes them unable to utilise the Act fully. In response to a motion by Senator Harradine in June 1994, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is inquiring into the practicality, cost and implications of requiring government departments to table in Parliament twice a year an index of files created in the previous six months.</PARA>
<PARA>And then mention is made of the EARC. This is not only designed to be an enhancement, an adjunct, to assist persons who undertake FOI exercises; more importantly, it is an important adjunct, an important tool, that can be used by the parliament for the purpose of its audit and control of executive government function. Thus, I was very pleased when this motion was adopted in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed the matter with Senator Vanstone before she moved the amendment to refer the matter to the Senate committee. From memory, a decision was made that the order should come into effect on 1 September, or the date of the report of the committee, whichever was the earlier. I was given to understand by Senator Vanstone that the addendum was designed to have the committee examine not whether relevant departmental files were to be produced but how they could be more effectively produced in a user-friendly manner. The government make a submission to the committee. The committee asked for only one submission, and that was from the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of reports suggest that there would be problems with the number and the usefulness of the files. That is contained in the government's submission. In regard to the number of files, many of the files created would relate to the personal affairs of taxpayers and the recipients of government payments and would, therefore, be outside the scope of the order.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment in the government's submission as to the usefulness of file titles makes me wonder at the logic behind the submission. Presumably, file titles are useful to the department; therefore, it would seem they would be useful to the parliament. If file titles are useless to the department&mdash;and, therefore, useless to the parliament&mdash;that is a reflection on the administration, which I cannot help.

The registries, which are now somewhat regionalised, should also know what is useful and what is not. The suggestion in the government's submission that policy initiatives would be compromised if meaningful titles were produced is, in reality, an admission that the listing of the file titles would assist parliament in its scrutiny of the actions of the executive.

Paragraph 37 of the government's submission says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it would be a most regrettable development were it to occur, the possibility should at least be recognised that the requirement to table file lists could, in some limited circumstances, lead to two possible highly undesirable practices, namely, use of less informative, even deliberately obscure, file titles and delaying the creation of files (and thereby jeopardising the proper custody of papers) until the subject had ceased to be of particular sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA>Was the government serious about that? The government is saying that there could be a deliberate obstruction by the provision of false file titles. It says that that would be regrettable; indeed, it would be. It would be even more regrettable from the point of view of the public servants who may do that in an effort to thwart the order of the Senate, adopted by the elected representatives of the public, if the Senate decided to use its powers to ensure that that order was complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a need for a cooperative approach. That is why I entered into those discussions with the minister. I am concerned about a number of matters. I am concerned about the institutional memory of various government departments.

<PARA>In plain English translation, the interpolation by Sir Humphrey Appleby would be this: `We are giving you more than we want to give you, and we don't want to give you anymore.' It must, however, be conceded that this is a masterly opening gambit by Sir Humphrey. It is an extraordinary statement. Paragraph 2 of the submission says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even so, the Government fully realises and accepts that the inevitable changes over time in the way the executive arm of government operates and the likely continuing evolution of the scrutiny role of the Parliament will necessarily involve a constant reassessment by both Parliament and government of Parliament's requirements in this regard and as a result, the nature of the information provided and the form of documentation will no doubt continue to develop.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Who decides? It is a good question, Senator Evans: who decides that? As will be noted by the Senate, it means that virtually every policy file can be excluded from the listing if the government is to decide what is or what is not in the public interest. By contrast, the order of the Senate contains words to the effect `agreed upon between Senator Evans and me'. It only allows exclusion of a part of the name of a file title if that part would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. Again, those were the words that were agreed. It was clear to both Senator Evans and me that they were needed to avoid the situation that we will get into now where the department can simply exclude the title of any file, the disclosure of which it deems would be damaging to the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key words in the order of the Senate include the word `necessarily'. One excludes a file title if that part would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. Senator Evans hit the nail on the head when he suggested the words `in the public interest'. I am sure the Senate will see that it is important that we stick with the order, which is quite definite on that matter. The way `file title' is defined, it means the name or title of the file, excluding any part of that name or title which would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. It is important that the parliament take a stand on this matter, ensure that this order stand and that the government be invited now to do what it said it would do and cooperate with the order, as it said it would. </PARA>

<PARA>In general terms we are obviously supportive of more open government. We were certainly prepared to enter into a dialogue as to whether such a proposal, if passed, would significantly contribute towards providing members of the public with information upon which they could then be more confident as to the proper conduct of their government. We believe lifting the veils of secrecy on government is, in general terms, in the public interest, subject to proper safeguards which obviously include enabling the government to go about its business effectively&mdash;issues of national security, personnel and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Harradine's notice of motion was overtaken by other events. The principal event was the sports rorts affair, which, as you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, was an appalling incident of government abuse when government used principally taxpayers' money through sports and recreation grants to advance its political interests. Basically the then minister was caught out when she was unable to demonstrate publicly how one grant was given over another&mdash;how one applicant was successful over another that was not. That really demonstrated the whole political bias of the sports rorts program of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the sports rorts affair was not set up by that minister; it was set up by former Senator Richardson. We on this side of the chamber were particularly interested in getting to the background of that particular program really, I guess, to evidence a case through public knowledge that would ensure better behaviour by governments in the future. What we have seen, particularly of Senator Richardson, is that when the heat is put on, he resigns from his ministry, as he did over the Marshall Islands affair. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats voted against it again, I think. The Australian Democrats go out there and claim to keep the bastards honest, but each time it comes to the crunch, each time it becomes a little bit too sensitive for a minister, they vote with the government and say, `Public inquiry and public information are not in the public interest and therefore we will vote down the suggestion of an inquiry.' In this instance, instead of such a public inquiry, which would have been of great benefit to the public in terms of information as to how this government goes about its business and, in particular, how it abuses taxpayers' funds to advance its short-term political goals, the minorities in this chamber did separate deals with the government and then voted against our proposed inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall it, the Australian Democrats reached certain agreements with the government which resulted in them voting against our inquiry. Senator Harradine, as he is well entitled, made an agreement with the government as well, which led him to vote against the inquiry. Part of that agreement concerned undertakings given by Senator Evans in relation to Senator Harradine's notice of motion No. 544 which I read out a moment ago and which he had given late the previous year. What did Senator Evans promise in relation to that? He promised in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Only discussion on the detail of the drafting, not discussion on the principle at all, not discussion on the number of departments, not discussion on the information to be given, just the detail of the drafting, the mechanical functions of putting it in proper order. He said he would support motion No. 544, which is that which I read. I will quote it in full because it ought to be properly on the record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has owned up, has he? He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, motion No. 544, notice of which was given by Senator Harradine on 16 December 1993. That motion would require publication by way of tabling in parliament of departmental file titles relating to policy matters, legislation and the like.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the undertaking of the minister. Then, I understand&mdash;I understand also that it is not in dispute&mdash;that consultation took place between Senator Harradine and Senator Evans as to the implementation of that undertaking and they reached agreement as to a set of words. Senator Evans I think has referred to his correspondence dated 27 June in which he put a detailed drafting proposal to Senator Harradine as to how it might be implemented. It covered, as I read it, all departments. It simply provided for the information to be staggered in the future for management purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems from the correspondence that Senator Harradine, or Senator Harradine's office, agreed to that detail. So basically the Senate was then in a situation where the Leader of the Government in the Senate had given an undertaking to Senator Harradine. He and Senator Harradine had discussed the detailed form of that undertaking, agreement had been reached and it was then in the form of an agreed motion between the two of them to be brought to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then happened was that we said that we believed, notwithstanding that agreement, that there were practical issues that still might be looked at by a Senate committee. You may remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, the contribution of Senator Vanstone on behalf of the coalition on 28 June 1994 when that debate came on in the Senate. I will quote at random from her short speech. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition is very supportive of the intention of Senator Harradine's motion . . . that we are not in any way trying to stop his motion.</PARA>
<PARA>She said that we were interested in seeing whether it might be further improved. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are strongly supportive of any initiatives to improve the accountability of the executive to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>She said that we wanted to ensure that it was being done in a cost efficient form. She then said that we would be interested to see:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whether the intention of Senator Harradine's motion can be further refined in a more practical and cost-efficient way than it already has been.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, we moved an amendment to the motion asking that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration look at particular issues within the sentiment of what she expressed. They were issues such as whether the material was being produced in a user friendly form; questions of practicability, how it could be done in a practical way; cost&mdash;we are always sensitive to issues of cost; implications for the departments; and, lastly, whether any more efficient and effective method may be devised to achieve the objectives behind the order. In other words, it was not an amendment to the motion to reconsider the substance of the Harradine initiative but rather to see whether it was being implemented in the most effective and efficient way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it you have ruled against the minister, Mr Acting Deputy President. He should not abuse the standing orders in that way. Basically, the committee was, it seems, sidetracked by a submission of the government that sought to get a second bite of the cherry. Rather than start from the premise that agreement had been reached between the minister and Senator Harradine, it really wanted the matters to be reconsidered. That, in effect, goes considerably beyond what we had intended and had implemented through the amendment we made to the motion in this place, which was to look at practical issues of implementation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of that was that, notwithstanding the advice of the committee, the coalition had to consider whether the case had been made out to, in effect, revoke the order of the Senate as to the tabling of documents and substitute something that was entirely different, that is, a test case in relation to two particular departments. We were a party to the previous motion that had led to that order, and we do not see, on the substance of the argument, that that case has been made out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We regret that the government did not go into the committee and acknowledge that the motion that was implemented through an order of this Senate was the agreement that had been reached between Senator Harradine and Senator Evans. If it had started and been debated on that basis, perhaps we would not be here today wanting to unscramble the egg and start again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the merit, basically we think the government ought to stand by the undertaking that it gave in this matter. It may not have been our preferred way to do business. Nevertheless, Senator Evans saw it as an opportunity to get himself out of the sports rorts inquiry; he gave certain undertakings; and he then reached agreement on the detail pursuant to his undertakings. And why should he not be made to keep those undertakings? It basically amounts to that.

But unless the Australian people want to really know how this government abuses their trust, how it abuses their taxes, we will never get full and proper accountability for the future. That is what it amounts to. We could never understand why, when it gets so close to the mark, the Australian Democrats are not prepared to put the government under final pressure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, while agreeing with this point about developing policy advice in confidence, said, `Okay, let us have a trial which is a real trial&mdash;not involving all 18 departments, or however many we have, but involving two departments&mdash;to see the practicalities of providing these file titles.' It was a compromise&mdash;even though I do not agree with providing the whole extent of the file titles&mdash;to say, `Let us see how is would work in practice, and do it prospectively.' I believe strongly that on administrative matters the parliament has a responsibility to oversee, as does the Auditor-General, to make sure there is proper accountability for the way the government performs. But policy development processes should be a matter for the government until it introduces its legislation. </PARA>

The politics is that executive government did not like what Senator Evans gave away that night and it is now trying to find a compromise. The compromise involves a trial with two departments, qualifications about what are excluded, and prospective application.

While we are revisiting this accountability package, Senator Hill needs to be reminded of some of the outcomes of that package which we are already working through in this parliament, not the least of which are the redrafted audit bill, the establishment of a parliamentary audit committee and the improved resourcing of the Office of the Auditor-General. We are not just focussing on the glory of getting a ministerial scalp; we are not focussing on the short term. We are saying to ourselves, `Let's try to make sure, by putting these processes in place, that this does not happen again.' Senator Harradine is attempting to do something a little similar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is getting a little tiring hearing this `abuse the Democrats' mantra of Senator Hill day after day. He seems to selectively forget the way in which we have cooperated with other Senate committees, including the Senate print media inquiry, the ABC inquiry and others that could be named. But Senator Hill likes to be selective in his mantra and he forgets the way he joins with other minorities to defeat government purposes in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having said all that, I have to say that I think the combination of the Spring session dates, which will be amended, and the public interest qualifications which have been added to this motion all sounds a bit too slippery for me. We saw in the debate relating to the print media inquiry the whole argument of public interest immunity. We have seen how far we have been able to take that. We know that we can come to the same dead end in this one, too, I suspect. But, given the Australian Democrats' record on the need for greater accountability of executive government and our involvement in this accountability package, the Democrats cannot come down on this occasion on the side of executive government using the public interest argument yet again. </PARA>

Firstly, all of this emanates from the so-called accountability package based, as it was, on a desperate attempt to ensure that there was not a parliamentary, or at least a Senate, inquiry into what became known as the sports rorts affair. Senator Evans, on 3 March, made a number of solemn promises to the Senate. The first part of that package was the new audit act, the parliamentary audit committee&mdash;</PARA>

I am not quite sure whether that will be done, but we will certainly see about that. The second part of the accountability package was a review of the Auditor-General's budget in the wake of the Centenary House royal commission undertaken by Justice Morling. We know there was some delay in that report because of the powers that were required to undertake that inquiry, but we now have the Morling report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that report may not have come out the way the coalition thought it might, one thing that needs to be remembered by the Senate is that Mr Justice Morling made some comments about the funding of the audit office. He specifically said that there will be a shortfall of just over half a million dollars in the next financial year, rising to a shortfall of $3.6 million towards the end of the lease and a total of $23.3 million during the term of that lease to the Australian Labor Party. So that is $23.3 million under the current funding arrangements that the audit office will be down and $23.3 million the Australian Labor Party will be up. This is mentioned on page 127 of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Royal commission of inquiry into the leasing by the Commonwealth of accommodation in Centenary House</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

That is not the money the Labor Party gets; that is just the windfall&mdash;the difference between what the audit office would normally be funded to and what the lease at Centenary House would provide.

Not only did he make a specific promise on 3 March to implement, after further discussion, Senator Harradine's motion No. 544, but the government went through, as has been described ad nauseam, a process of negotiation with Senator Harradine to ensure that the motion was put into a format that clearly Senator Evans and the government that he represents would be happy with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There has been a number of extraordinary features about this debate. I guess the most extraordinary single feature of it was the statement of no confidence by Senator Hill in his three parliamentary colleagues&mdash;Senator Watson, Senator Kemp and Senator Campbell&mdash;that they were incapable of thinking for themselves, seeing the issues for themselves and responding to the issues for themselves. They were simply sidetracked, says Senator Hill, by virtue of the government submission on this particular matter&mdash;a government submission that squarely addressed the very issues that the committee was set up to review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second most extraordinary thing about this debate has been the performance we have just witnessed from the two sidetrackees, who showed their absolute inability to be frank with the Senate by the way in which they ducked, weaved, shifted and diverted their way through their contributions to this debate&mdash;doing everything in this Senate except explaining why it is they are now turning 180 degrees on the matters in issue from the positions they adopted when they were sitting on that committee and responding to the issues before that committee. They have done everything today except explain why it is they voted, as members of the committee, explicitly for a recommendation to revoke the order of June 1994 and are now, in the Senate, voting to reinstate and to maintain that particular order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have done everything except address the issues that this particular committee was set up to address and which they addressed, presumably with a degree of persistence and attention to the policy issues involved, which presumably they addressed, in terms of the outcome, with a degree of policy decency because they responded, as committee members, to the concerns expressed by the government about the unworkability of this particular measure with a bit of decency and with a bit of regard to the realities of government administration and the practical difficulties of making a resolution like this work, but they showed themselves utterly unable to sustain that decency for more than about five minutes when they got a sniff of some politics involved in the way in which this matter has come before the parliament. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. For them to say that they were undertaking their committee responsibilities in a sense of ignorance or of being unaware of the nature of the course of events that had preceded the establishment of the committee is to either dissimulate or to carry ignorance to the point of unbelievable ineptitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter was that it was perfectly evident that the particular resolution passed in June was one that the government was prepared to accept in the very terms in which Senator Harradine moved it. It was clear from my statement in March that there were going to be discussions about the drafting of the terms of that resolution. It was perfectly clear from what Senator Harradine said in the Senate. As reported on page 2100 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 28 June, in moving and amending his own motion, Senator Harradine said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans on that day&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to 3 March&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gave that assurance, subject to further consideration and details, to ensure that it was properly implemented. Further discussions have taken place. The result is the motion I have now moved.</PARA>
<PARA>There is Harradine on the record saying that the results of&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine saying, `The result of the discussions is the motion I now move&mdash;it is the product of discussions.' Of course, it was the subject of discussions and, of course, I frankly acknowledge that I was party to those discussions and conceded. The reason I conceded is that I was over a barrel. Senator Harradine had a majority in this place and I had made a commitment to do something in that area. The particular terms in which the resolution came forward were as far as Senator Harradine was prepared to go in those discussions. That was Senator Harradine's right to take that position. He took a position. I went as far as I could go in accommodating him and that is the basis of it. There is no doubt and there is no mystery about all of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third extraordinary thing about this debate is Senator Hill's claim that the only reason the committee was set up was to look at the question of how to look at the way in which particular information seekers could best get the information that Senator Harradine wanted them to be able to obtain. Senator Hill was either blithely ignorant of, or dissimulating in terms of his own knowledge of, the way in which that particular committee was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let Senator Vanstone speak for herself. Let me quote these two paragraphs on page 2103 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 28 June. This is the Senator Vanstone who actually moved the motion to refer this to the committee and who moved the precise terms of reference&mdash;all the terms of reference&mdash;that the committee adopted. Senator Vanstone said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So just providing the information in form is not good enough. We think this is a good enough idea to ensure that the information is provided in a user-friendly form. Some of the other things we want to look at are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the practicality of implementing the order;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the cost of carrying out the order;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the implications of the order for Commonwealth Departments;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This is still Senator Vanstone&mdash;the opposition's Senator Vanstone who moved the motion and who set the terms of reference, and I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also need to look at whether there is another more efficient and effective way to achieve the same aim. So we are not in any way opposed to the intent of what Senator Harradine wants to achieve. We are strongly supportive of any initiatives to improve the accountability of the executive to this parliament. We just want to make the point that for ideals to become reality, a lot of hard work has to take place. Someone has to have an idea.</PARA>
<PARA>For once, that was a perfectly sensible proposition from Senator Vanstone about the need to scrutinise again the whole substance of this particular resolution. She was obviously concerned that this might not be the most practical, cost-effective and reasonable way of advancing an aim, or an aspiration or an intention which we were all prepared to share. So that is the basis on which opposition senators embarked upon this exercise. They did it with their eyes open. They showed a bit of policy decency for once in the way in which they responded to the committee obligation. They have run out of decency pretty rapidly as soon as the opportunity has now come to test their consistency and seriousness of purpose in this matter. That will be remembered by most people whom they would like to take them seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point that I want to make is about the workability of the order in the present form. The only real exemptions in the way in which that order is expressed at the moment are for these three specific areas in relation to titles which would necessarily disclose commercially confidential, identifiably personal or national security matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a practical matter of executive government, there are many more kinds of disclosure than those subsumed by just those three categories which would create real practical difficulties for the business of government. Take economic management, for example; take exchange rate management; take the possibility of a new tax measure or a new savings measure with very substantial implications for a particular affected group which the government is at an early stage of considering&mdash;matters which, in the time-honoured business of government, all sides of politics have acknowledged to be matters that are entirely appropriately maintained confidential until such time as the government is ready to make the announcement and then to bear the consequences, bear the flack, of the decision for better or for worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take in my own foreign policy area the number of issues that might well be disclosed by file titles that were other than purely anodyne and purely useless. They might disclose the possibility of a particular visit by some statesman, a head of government or someone from another country which would be highly sensitive and very damaging to our bilateral relations with that government were the terms of it to be disclosed before it was ready to be announced in that other country. That has nothing to do with personal confidentiality. That has nothing to do with national security, because national security does not mean just foreign relations at large. National security means things going to the defence and security of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us instance an important international matter, but not one immediately related to the defence of the integrity of the country&mdash;for example, a Security Council candidacy, or a policy initiative that we might be imminently about to launch in relation to some matter of United Nations administration, or perhaps the composition of the Security Council. They may be highly sensitive matters that one does not want perhaps to let out that one is even considering because to do so would be counterproductive to the ends one is trying to achieve. Questions of support for particular candidacies and questions about aspects of one's bilateral relations and a possible shift in policy in relation to some other country&mdash;issues of this kind traditionally have been regarded as sufficiently sensitive to justify not only confidentiality as to the detail, because the detail will not be revealed by this, but confidentiality as to whether or not the government is actually in the business of giving consideration to the matter at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the things that we are genuinely concerned about in the motion as it is at the moment. Maybe I was not sufficiently focused on them or concerned about them in the rush of events back in June to have focused on the implications of them and to have had discussions in the way that in retrospect I should have. But that focus has been placed upon these sorts of issues, and many others as well, in the government's submission and it was the subject of the committee consideration during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fruitless task, given the way in which people have now committed themselves and the way in which they are obviously going to vote, to get them to go backwards on this. But I do ask that there be a willingness to look at the implications of this in practice sooner rather than later. If this thing is going to be passed, let us not only do it with the date amendments which Senator Harradine has kindly indicated he is willing to accept&mdash;that is helpful and I thank him; and we will certainly embrace those&mdash;but let us do it with some earlier review mechanism than that which was originally contemplated after the two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will so move if it can be done, hopefully by leave; otherwise I will have to put a notice of motion in&mdash;and I do not want to debate this all over again. But I would ask, if it is possible to reach consensus on this proposition, that a review be undertaken by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee of the information provided in response to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amended motion, the committee to report to the Senate by no later than 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the opposition, for all the rest of the absence of help it has given us, at least to contemplate the utility of having some earlier review mechanism in place, given what opposition senators themselves have put their signatures to, namely, a serious expression of concern as to the cost effectiveness and workability of the particular thing that they are now about to ram down our throats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than leave it a couple of years, as was originally contemplated&mdash;and I frankly acknowledge that it was contemplated it would be a couple of years&mdash;let us please have a look at it on the basis of the first two batches of information that will be laboriously compiled and will be put down, using our best endeavours, in February and March in compliance, I hope, with the terms of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask Senator Harradine&mdash;I know he is a bit grumpily inclined about this particular proposal&mdash;to perhaps reconsider that opposition and perhaps be prepared in good faith to accept the legitimacy of our concerns about just whether this is going to work or not. When he sees what he gets in February and March he might be the first person shrieking for a review, saying, `This is no good. This is not telling me anything.' That is a possibility. It will not be for an absence of good faith; but it may just be the nature of the exercise that he is demanding of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: the government's position is one of wanting to insist on this particular motion but acknowledging, unhappily, the reality that we are not going to get it, given what has been said, and foreshadowing that further amendment to the original order as a result. </PARA>

I think that gives the committee sufficient scope to look at basically anything that it wants to look at. Hopefully it will confine itself to things that are helpful in terms of getting a better system of public administration in this country. </PARA>

The problem with such a broad motion is that if the government departments do what they say they were intending to do in their submission to the committee, as Senator Harradine pointed out, they will provide you with a whole bunch of information. In fact, they will target the review. They will say, `We will snow these guys; we will make it ineffective and inefficient,' and the review will be a process to ensure that it falls down. That is why we specifically say `efficiency and effectiveness of the government's compliance with this'&mdash;not `issues related to the information'. Quite frankly, I do not think we can support this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address once again, as I have done over the years, the position of Ellenbrae Station in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Ellenbrae Station is located in the heart of the Kimberleys. It is accessed by the Gibb River Road, which runs from the Great Northern Highway in the east, joining the Wyndham-Kununurra Road, which runs to Derby in the west. The station is surrounded predominantly by other pastoral leases, except to the north and west, where Drysdale River National Park is situated. To the east of that, there is the Oombulguri Reserve, which was formerly the Forrest River Mission. As I have said in this place before, in 1990 the first big fire came out of Oombulguri and burnt 80 per cent of Ellenbrae Station. To my knowledge, since then it has been burnt out from that same direction for four out of the last five years, putting Ellenbrae in an impossible situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked during estimates and in this place about the position of Aboriginal reserves. I asked whether they have insurance cover&mdash;as is the case with any other incorporated organisations or individual organisations which carry on some sort of commercial or cultural activity and which have insurance to cover damage caused by that pastoral lease, farming entity or whatever&mdash;with regard to actions they have undertaken which involve water or fire escaping from that property. I could never get an answer as to what the situation might be&mdash;especially from Senator Cook, who at the time was handling questions in the Senate relating to that portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not compulsory to have this sort of third party insurance, but of course it is wise to do so in case, say, a fire goes from my property on to somewhere else and burns the neighbours out. I was never able, as I said, to get any answer on the situation. The owners of Ellenbrae Station have not been able to get any compensation out of anyone in all that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate on the Mabo legislation last year, Senator Gareth Evans, who led the debate on the bill for the government, assured us that all regulations on such things as bushfires and land care would apply to land held by Aboriginals in their own names or land secured by this Mabo style legislation where native title existed. We were led to believe that that was the situation but, of course, now the owner of this station, Byrne Terry, has nowhere to go except to start some impossible sort of action. If there had been insurance, they would have had some recourse, but obviously they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where these people can go because, at any drop of a hat, they could get the same treatment. From certain investigations that have been done, we have found out that the attitude of the Aboriginal community and, for that matter, the attitude of the government department responsible for Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia&mdash;I wish Senator Collins would visit the place and get his own view on the impossible position that these people are in&mdash;towards the land-holders is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears the rights of land-holders are secondary to the rights of the Aboriginal community. That may be so. If they want to think that way, let them think that way. But to take out common third party insurance would be a very wise idea. The people are still legitimately in pastoral pursuits. I say `legitimately' because anyone running a pastoral concern is legitimate when they pay their pastoral fees, adhere to what the pastoral board of Western Australia tells them to do and pay their fees for shire rates and pay their land lease rates to the West Australian government. So they should have some rights in this situation. Clearly, this sort of discrimination affects other people besides the Terrys of Ellenbrae station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the present situation in light of the Mabo decision has given rise to conflict between Aborigines and other residents of this country. Until responsible and reasonable safeguards are put in place, this problem will continue&mdash;and it is very interesting to note that the minister with responsibility for Aboriginal matters in this chamber has just walked out without listening. Until reasonable and responsible safeguards are put in place, this problem will continue to manifest itself, creating division between the Aboriginal community and other land-holders. Senator Evans told us time and time again during the Mabo debate last year that that would not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears clear that if the fire had escaped from leasehold property&mdash;that is, another sort of pastoral lease, under which the majority of land in that area is&mdash;the owners of the station would have been compensated through the insurance that they would have held. Through no fault of their own, the owners of Ellenbrae have suffered extreme hardship, which will continue unless the problem is addressed immediately. The attitude displayed by government departments which handle Aboriginal affairs is clearly biased and dismissive of any problems as far as the Aboriginal community is concerned. This is quite contrary to the actual position that prevails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the situation is that this station that operates as a legal pastoral entity has been burnt out four times in the last five years. The year I flew over it, it was completely burnt out. The cattle holding, according to the best figures that I have, has been reduced from about 20,000 to about 2,000 or 3,000 because of these fires&mdash;deliberately lit in most cases, as far as I can see&mdash;which have driven them almost to the point of bankruptcy. The owners of Ellenbrae have had to take on other jobs, such as operating bulldozers for the shire and doing contract work for the shire, to keep their station going. They have dug in and said that they are not going to be driven out by fires. Yet federal departments are not interested in the problem, nor is the Aboriginal department interested in the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of justice, it is time that someone took this matter in hand and did something about it. Otherwise where is freedom in the Kimberleys, or in Australia for that matter? If the government wants to do away with a pastoral industry in the Kimberleys, or if the Aborigines want to do that, let them say so and properly compensate the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that is the way to go. We have a viable industry there and we should keep it there. But we should not let the government or anyone else drive these people out by simply burning them out and putting them into bankruptcy. I hope someone takes notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight somewhat disillusioned with what I believe to be the normal processes that should operate under Commonwealth-state relations and responsibilities in regard to environmental management. Many senators will be aware that for a number of months now Senator Woodley, Senator Faulkner, Senator Kernot, Senator Coulter, Senator Ian Macdonald and I have been raising questions about the nature of a major resort development at Oyster Point in the Hinchinbrook area just out of Cardwell. This area, of course, is sandwiched between two unique world heritage areas&mdash;the wet tropics and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been ongoing strenuous efforts on the part of the Friends of Hinchinbrook. There have been strenuous efforts on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to reach some rational, realistic agreement about the scale and type of development that is appropriate in this very unique area, unique not just for Queenslanders or for Australians but unique by virtue of it being an area between two World Heritage designated areas. I have to say it has been a story of frustration, it has been a story of a refusal of the Queensland department of environment to really come to terms with the nature of its responsibilities as a joint manager with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about states rights in this place and in the other place. We hear a lot about the need for cooperation. We hear a lot about the Commonwealth using its powers to override the states. I do not believe that any of that would be necessary if only we could get rational cooperation and coordination. This project got off on the wrong foot to start with when the office of the Coordinator-General decided that it seemed like a good idea at the time to allow a major resort, a very large scale resort, to be developed at this particular location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had appropriate environmental impact assessment been undertaken, had there been a genuine consultation and listening to the views, not just of local people but of the scientists who have the understanding of this very special and unique ecosystem, we might not be in the situation that we are today. Perhaps Senator Woodley should have gone first this evening, because I know he will be speaking more about some of these details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent quite a bit of the weekend taking phone calls from the site where people were determined to protect the mangroves. Many senators will say, `Oh, they are protesters; oh, they are radicals, rent-a-crowds.' They are people who are trying to save a relatively small area of mangroves. In this day and age, protection of mangroves, I thought, was pretty well recognised as important, particularly in the vicinity of World Heritage areas. These people are so determined to protect the mangroves. Why do they want to protect mangroves? Why would they sit in mud and walk back and forth through mud for days at a time to protect the mangroves if they did not seriously believe, as the scientists believe, that the mangroves must be protected in order to maintain the existing seagrass beds on which dugong are so dependent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there has been an overwhelming body of scientific evidence critical of this particular proposal and calling for a much more cautious approach. There has been the Valentine report; three eminent scientists on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green and Practical</EMPHASIS> program voiced their concerns last week; and Dr Tony Preen has indicated that mortality rates of dugongs&mdash;I remind the Senate, an endangered species&mdash;would be likely to rise by 25 per cent in the area as a result of the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps some listeners might say, `Well, this development is on private land. In this country, people have the right to develop on private land providing they go through the proper processes and get the appropriate permits.' I have to say that Keith Williams has those, but the question is: why at this 11th hour on Friday was public land rapidly gazetted so that Keith Williams was able to go in this morning and start removing the mangroves? Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me describe to the chamber where this resort will be. The resort on land will be, I am sure, an attractive resort. I would say it is far too big. What is on the land is not acceptable in my book, but we are not going to argue about the private land aspect of this. Mr Williams was given permission to put up a fence to protect his site, allegedly from protesters. The only thing is that the protesters have not been on private land; their attention has been towards the mangroves. So the fence went up over the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this absolute determination to remove the mangroves, even though the private land site needs a great deal of attention and work for months before there can be any resort there. But why does Keith Williams want to clear the mangroves? I will tell the Senate why, and some senators will laugh. He wants an artificial Hawaiian style beach there. Why? Because there is no beach there&mdash;it is just mud and mangroves&mdash;and those senators who know what mangroves are would know that people would not sit on the edge of mangroves to sun themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason why people would not sit on either the mangrove site or indeed the artificial beach and that is that this particular channel area is infested with crocodiles. The ridiculous thing about this whole development is that people in Brisbane are making decisions and they do not seem to know that they are trying to put a beach along a channel that is infested with crocodiles. Who is going to sit on the beach, much less go into the water, when it is infested with crocodiles?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just this afternoon I received this note from the partner of a fisherman. He said, `I don't know why anyone would want to put a beach there. There are crocodiles in that channel. It is very unsafe. By the time you get the stingers and the massive crocodiles that come around the protected fish area, why would anybody want to sun themselves on the beach?' The issue here is: why would a government&mdash;a government of which I am very proud, the Queensland Labor government&mdash;go out of its way to have the mangroves cleared when there is all this work to be done on private land? It just does not make sense. Quite clearly, it is a classic case of people not understanding the issue, making decisions a thousand kilometres or more south and not seeing the reality of their decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened today? The protesters have continued to take the stand, and I commend the stand that they are taking. They are not radical activists; they are very deeply committed people who believe in what they are doing. This morning the excavator moved in. There was no workplace health and safety officer as there should have been. The machine came very close to a number of the protesters. One woman was assaulted and she claims&mdash;and I have written it down&mdash;that a police officer jabbed her behind the ear; he got a finger near the nerve centre and she temporarily blacked out, and she has had a headache ever since. Another protester was seriously hurt. He was punched, this time not by police&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday evening I was honoured to meet with President Eduardo Frei of Chile on his visit to Australia en route to the APEC meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. President Frei happily chose to meet with the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Keating, on Saturday and then in the evening to meet with chief executive officers of major Australian enterprises with interests in Chile, and I was one member of the parliament to also meet with him.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As president of the Australia-Chile friendship group in this parliament, I was delighted to do so. I am also pleased to see that my only predecessor in that position, Senator Schacht, is present in the chamber. Last parliament a number of us formed the Australia-Chile friendship group. Senator Schacht was a distinguished first president of the group, and I have followed on during this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Frei brought with him to Australia and on to the Bogor meeting the most powerful delegation of business and parliamentary leaders ever to travel outside Chile with the President. There were six members of parliament and 44 business representatives from Chile who, as chief executive officers, represent enterprises in that country that produce more than half the gross national product of Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did a few of us have the chance to meet with President Frei on Saturday evening, but afterwards there was a very appropriate welcoming dinner for about 100 business representatives and parliamentary representatives who had travelled with the President. This welcoming dinner was sponsored by the Australian-Latin American Business Council, in particular the President, Mr Jose Blanco, who also gave an excellent address at Saturday evening's dinner, also by the Australia-Chile Business and Investment Council and the Australia-Chile Chamber of Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that in this week, when Chile is admitted for the first time as the newest member of APEC, President Frei chose to stop over in Australia. This visit reinforces the common purpose that Australia and Chile have in working to achieve trade liberalisation in our Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large. As we all know, Chile was a major partner with us in the Cairns Group in the Uruguay Round of the GATT and will continue, I believe, to share many of our objectives in the new World Trade Organisation to begin on 1 January next year. More than that, Australia provides Chile with an opportunity for investment. Chile will be able to establish regional offices in Australia as a doorway into Asia. In a very parallel way, Chile is offering Australia a secure investment base and a place for representative offices, not only for Australian business to take up opportunities in that country, but as a doorway to South America generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, Australian trade with Chile is only $140 million but it has grown at the most rapid rate of any country with which Australia has traded over the last 10 years. The average growth for each of the last 10 years has been 35 per cent. I believe that, whilst the whole of our Latin American trade is only one per cent of our exports, it has the prospect of growing three-fold in the next six or seven years. It is with that in mind that I have spoken about Latin America&mdash;and Chile and Mexico in particular&mdash;as our most prospective business partners, nation to nation, in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia&mdash;in particular north-east Asia&mdash;will be the priority area for Australian exports, but it is right that we look at our newest APEC member as part of a continent that currently receives one per cent of Australian exports; and could receive three times that amount. Australia has $700 million of investments in Chile. In fact, we are the second largest overseas investing nation in that country. A great part of that investment is in the mining industry in Chile which, of course, is the biggest wealth producer for that country. Australian expertise and equipment, and mineral finance&mdash;as my colleague Senator Parer understands very well&mdash;are areas where Australia can bring investment, technical knowledge and other expertise to Chile to the benefit of both Australia and that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I not only note the welcome we all give to President Frei in his timely visit to this country, but also want to note that this has other areas of significance beyond reinforcement of its entry into APEC. President Frei's visit is just 12 months after the visit by President Patricio Aylwin, his predecessor as President of Chile. Former President Aylwin had a successful visit to this country, in particular to the parliament here in Canberra where we welcomed him. To have two presidents in succession&mdash;in the space of 12 months&mdash;coming from Chile is a very accurate reflection of the importance Chile gives to Australia. We should be much readier to respond to the interest Chile is expressing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Australian government to take up three proposals that I have urged in recent months&mdash;and which the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, has happily conversed with me about. We have exchanged letters but it has yet to be fully agreed to. These three proposals are, first, that we establish a bilateral free trade and investment agreement between Australia and Chile, to the benefit of both our countries. I have said in the past that it is not enough for us to get Australia's interests preserved regionally within GATT or the new World Trade Organisation&mdash;that is internationally or in APEC. We should have some specific bilateral agreements that are to our benefit and that are WTO and APEC consistent. We ought now to formulate such a bilateral agreement and reinforce all of our opportunities by putting it in place in the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that we establish an air link between Lan Chile and Qantas. That is of enormous importance. The third point is that, whether through the east-Asia analytical unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or through a similar unit, there should be a detailed economic study of our trade and investment prospects to reinforce all that is happening now. For instance, some 30 firms have their regional offices in Santiago, the capital of Chile. I would like the government to very constructively take up these three proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, protesters were removed from the Oyster Point site near Cardwell in North Queensland. Apparently, they were dragged off by security guards with the coastguard and police looking on. I have been told that protesters on the site were dragged off over and over again. At least two were injured; one was punched unconscious. I am informed that the doctor in Cardwell, not wanting to get involved, refused to treat one of the injured people who had been assaulted by a police officer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Margaret Thorsborne, a 70-year-old lady about five feet tall, was dragged off the site with undue force. I might add that two years ago Margaret Thorsborne was declared to be the citizen of the year in Cardwell. What crime had these people committed? None! There were no arrests. The police were just another service provided by the Queensland government to this developer. What the protesters were doing was a service to all of us in Queensland, Australia and internationally. They were trying to protect our world heritage. That is something the Queensland government and the federal government are charged with doing. However, they have done anything but protect our heritage in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protesters feel totally disempowered. One of the conservationists just called one of my staff and said, `What do you do? The SES sat under a tarp all day eating pies. This wasn't a show but they turned it into one. What do you do when the people you normally turn to for help, like the coastguard, just watch as someone is knocked unconscious and a gracious and wonderful lady is dragged away? What do you do when the police are knocking people about or turning their backs while someone else does?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the Senate I gave notice of a motion condemning the Queensland government for its outrageous behaviour in gazetting a piece of public land for the exclusive use of developer Keith Williams. This public land is now a marine park, rather like a national park, and should not be given willy-nilly for destruction by a 24-hour sneaky gazettal. The protesters were trying to protect the old-growth mangroves, which in turn protect the vast seagrass meadows which feed the vulnerable-to-extinction dugong. Those seagrass meadows have been found by internationally recognised marine biologist Tony Preen to have a rare species of seagrass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Hinchinbrook Channel is a place with a number of rare and endangered species. That is why it is World Heritage. That is why it is of paramount importance to protect it. Hinchinbrook was called the jewel in the crown of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park when it was nominated for World Heritage. It was called that because it had nearly all the species of mangroves in Australia; three species of endangered sea turtle&mdash;the loggerhead, flatback and green turtle; three species of endangered dolphins&mdash;the humpback, bottlenose and irrawaddi; and, of course, the dugong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an area of land near the resort on which Mr Williams wants to build an airport capable of taking 737s. At the moment there is a tiny airstrip adjacent to the Edmund Kennedy national park. Will the Queensland government resume part of the Edmund Kennedy national park for this developer to build his international airport? This tiny strip is at present capable of taking only six-seater aircraft. On the other side, there is the Bruce Highway. I assume even the Queensland government would not gazette that, but who knows? If it makes a present of part of the Edmund Kennedy national park for Mr Williams, perhaps we should say goodbye to the two most endangered mammals in Queensland&mdash;that is, the mahogony glider and the cassowary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future, developers such as Mr Williams will never admit that they were responsible for the death of a species. They promise us the world with jobs and income. But, really, does this resort, built on a huge mudflat where people will have to walk hundreds of metres over mud, swatting sandflies, in order to get to water that is a milky colour and very shallow, make any economic sense? The amazing thing is that the Queensland government has swallowed this snake oil sold it by the developer and is bending over backwards to help him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have told the parliament before how the Queensland government is selling the heritage of the planet by forcing through this development. This is despite public outcry, outrage from scientists all over the country and overseas, and the reservations of the federal government. One must ask: why support such an appalling plan? I understand the answer is</PARA>
<PARA>that a deal has been done to secure the endorsement of one of the Premier's own AWU faction. So a political deal in Queensland means we will lose our integrity and our gift to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By lunchtime tomorrow, if the federal government does not act to protect these magnificent old-growth mangroves, they will be cleared forever. I call for a moratorium on the clearing, and for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the federal government to act as a matter of urgency to proclaim the Hinchinbrook Channel under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. It is clearly in danger, and we cannot wait until those critically important mangroves are destroyed and the seagrass beds start to die. No-one has a mandate to destroy the earth, but the Queensland government has bent over backwards to give a developer the legal right, but not the moral right, to destroy this part of the earth. </PARA>
