<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is another side to the matter: the opposition has put down a matter of public importance today&mdash;a matter of grave public importance&mdash;and that is the government's failure to allow Australia's small business sector to reach its potential and provide real and lasting jobs to Australia's one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the government's request would be to push that matter to a later hour of this day, which causes us real concern. What we have, therefore, suggested to the government as a sensible compromise is that the government allow us the hour for our matter of public concern to be dealt with out of government business time, that is, the last hour of the morning's business.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this Government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in Schedule 1 of that Act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 57 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the effect of this bill would be to bring within the Schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Wampana Land Claim. The Northern Territory Government, the Central Land Council and Gambamora Industries Pty Ltd have entered into an agreement which settles that Land Claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory Government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the Land Rights Act to grant the claim area to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no financial implications arising from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, to enable the adjustment of interest rates applicable to the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme to remove an irregularity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme established under the Act provides for a subsidised loan of up to $40,000 to members or ex-members of the Australian Defence Force for a period related to their length of service. The loans are made available by the National Australia Bank. The Bank paid a franchise fee to the Commonwealth to provide loans under the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subsidy to be paid on a loan in any month is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest to be paid over the life of the loan, calculated on a 25 year period at the Benchmark Interest Rate applying for that month. Essentially, the Benchmark Interest Rate is assessed on a month-by-month basis and represents the lower of the rate offered by the National Australia Bank and the average of the rates offered by the five largest Australian banks. The method of calculating the Benchmark Interest Rate is prescribed in subclause 5.15 of the Agreement between the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth, contained in Schedule 1 to the Act. Section 35 of the Act prohibits amendment of subclause 5.15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclause 5.15 is currently operating in a manner that was not originally envisaged and which is not desired either by the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth. The irregularity has arisen because special low introductory rates for new loans with interest fixed for a period of 12 months or less were not contemplated when the Agreement was drawn up. The present wording of subclause 5.15 applies these introductory rates to all borrowers under the scheme, irrespective of whether they are new borrowers, and for as long as those rates are on public offer. These special introductory rates are significantly lower than the Bank's majority interest rate which previously would have applied. For example, from August 1993 to April 1994 the Bank's introductory rate was 5 per cent compared to the majority rate of 9.5 per cent, and from April, 6.95 per cent compared to 8.75 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This irregularity will occur whenever a special introductory rate is offered by the National Australia Bank. This results in a reduction of interest charges to customers and interest receipts by the Bank, and a reduction in Commonwealth subsidy payment for each month that the lower interest rate applies. Potentially, continuation of the present situation would result in the Commonwealth receiving windfall savings of up to $400,000 in a full year, depending on the particular interest rates that apply at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth have agreed that subclause 5.15 of the Agreement should be amended so that borrowers under the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme have the benefit of the special introductory loan interest rates under the same conditions that they are available to the public. That is, the special rates would apply only for new borrowers and for the period that those rates are normally available to the public. Compared with applying the Bank's majority rate to all borrowers, the saving to the Commonwealth would be about $100,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable the changes to be made, section 35 of the Act will have to be amended to remove the prohibition on amending subclause 5.15 of the Agreement. The bill achieves this by removing the reference to Subclause 5.15 from section 35. I would like to stress that the proposed amendment of the Agreement, as outlined, will still be subject to clause 20 of the Agreement, which provides that any amendment to the Agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that Act two Excise Tariff Proposals that have been previously tabled in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 of 1993 proposed a reduction in the excise duty payable in respect of gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1993 proposed an increase in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas and kerosene for use in aircraft, or avtur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Avgas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas from $0.25456 per litre to $0.22443 per litre, a reduction of 3.013 cents per litre. This reduction is effective from 1 July 1993. This decrease results from three sources. The first is from the final stage of the Government's program of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging owners of local ownership plan aerodromes to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority, or CAA. The third is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements by the CAA in respect of the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. Both the firefighting and meteorological services will now be directly charged to aircraft operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost savings from these sources result in a corresponding reduction in the proportion of excise duty used to fund the aerodromes and the firefighting and meteorological services. This reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on avgas. A decrease of 1.013 cents per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program and the remaining 2 cents per litre reduction is attributable to the CAA in respect of firefighting and meteorological services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the bill proposes an increase in the excise duty payable on avgas to $0.22999 per litre, an increase of 0.264 cents per litre. This increase was announced in the 1993 Federal Budget and is effective from 1 September 1993. The purpose of the increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is the first stage in a program to phase in recovery of the industry's contribution to these costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Avtur</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the bill also proposes imposing an excise duty of 0.264 cents per litre on avtur. This change was also announced in the Federal Budget. This imposition of excise duty on a product previously free of duty is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is in conjunction with the proposed increase in avgas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Avgas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction of 1.013 cents per litre in respect of the transfer of ownership of aerodromes program will result in a reduction of revenue of $1 million in 1993-94 and $1 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined decrease of 2 cents per litre from the changes in the CAA's cost recovery arrangements in relation to firefighting services and meteorological services is balanced by an equivalent decrease in moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was caught in mid-flow yesterday when we adjourned the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill for another matter. I would like now to continue my remarks. I had already stated the Greens (WA) support of opposition amendments 3 and 4 and I had begun to recount our position in relation to the amendments and this legislation. The Greens do not support the principles underlying this legislation for reasons I will presently outline, which are also reasons for supporting these amendments. Nevertheless, we are voting on the amendments as a way of improving the bill from our point of view, as we understand it will be passed with majority support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns relate to the fact that this bill gives powers to the Health Insurance Corporation to investigate frauds arising under the Medicare scheme, and removes that responsibility for the investigations which currently lies with the Australian Federal Police. The rationale for this move is that the Australian Federal Police have not been interested in or, possibly, capable of investigating frauds in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of criticisms of the bill with potential for infringement of civil liberties have been either met or are covered by amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats, which is why the Greens are in support of all the amendments put up by the Democrats. However, there is also the question of whether police powers should be granted to persons outside the police. The danger with a number of organisations having police powers is that it is more difficult to ensure that adequate control is exercised over them. For this reason, we believe that the requirement to have a search warrant in order for the HIC to enter premises without permission of the occupier is a reasonable one. We therefore support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the concerns of the Greens (WA) with the entire Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993, but I bring to Senator Chamarette's attention the fact that this bill is supported by the medical profession&mdash;the AMA, the Doctors Reform Society and a wide range of medical groups&mdash;and, if anyone were going to be concerned about some of the issues she has raised, I believe it would be longstanding associations such as these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note a fax I received last night from David Kindon of the Australian Association of Pathology Practices also stressing that this bill is needed. Indeed, he says that these amendments are effectively undoing what has to be done if we are to crack down on the illegal practices currently going on in pathology. It will make it extremely difficult for the entire profession as he believes that, if those illegal practices cannot be stemmed, all practices will be worse off. The government will step in and say, `We are spending too much money on pathology', and it will make an across-the-board cut in incomes for all pathologists. This will further disadvantage those people who are doing the right thing and will do absolutely nothing to crack down on the unlicensed centres that are operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons those search powers will be so useful is that the hundreds of unlicensed centres&mdash;the Australian Association of Pathology Practices Inc. has the belief that there are indeed hundreds of these centres&mdash;cannot be checked up on or spot checked. The likelihood of getting search warrants in all those cases is not only very difficult but probably so time consuming that it simply will not be effective. If these amendments go through, we simply will not be able to crack down on some of the rorts that have been documented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been interested to hear the comments of both Senator Chamarette and Senator Lees. My concern is with the facts to which Senator Lees has just referred and which have come from Dr Kindon. My experience with legislation of this kind is that doctors are good at doctoring and lawyers have perhaps a better understanding of civil liberties issues. With this particular piece of legislation, for example, it was not until the opposition looked carefully at this bill and alerted the medical organisations to some of the hidden difficulties that they started to realise that the rights of both their practitioners and their patients could be in jeopardy under the bill as originally printed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We alerted them to the concerns which we had. They then took the bill to legal advisers, and they were advised that our concerns were reasonable and that there was a need for improving this act. While we all support the purpose of the act, there are genuine concerns as to civil liberties. The privacy issues have been addressed. It remains to be seen in practice whether they are adequately addressed, but it appears on the surface that those issues have been improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are concerned, as I said yesterday, that people are being given police authorities without the controls which the police in this land are subject to. We do not believe that we can rely on the doctors' wish to clean up the fraud as being so overwhelming that civil rights concerns can be ignored. We are committed to cleaning up the fraud in the medical area, where it exists. In fact, the opposition has been keen, and expressed its views, on this issue long before this legislation came in. So there can be no way in which it could be suggested that we are soft on crime in connection with medical fraud. Nevertheless, I reiterate what I said yesterday: the end cannot justify unsatisfactory means. That is why we are so concerned to see that a search warrant should be obtained before such an entry takes place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words about this issue. I have listened to the speeches from Senator Lees, Senator Chamarette and Senator Newman. I must confess that they put the argument very well. I am Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked at this bill. It detected matters that did go to the issue of civil liberties and to the issues of the sort of society that we want to live in. What has been said so far illustrates that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, though, that the Health Insurance Commission is in a difficult position. On the one hand, it is pressured to ensure that all crime is detected and suppressed. On the other hand, it is attacked because it goes too far. I think the problem arises from the pressures within society itself and the pressures which are reflected here. It is a good thing, as Senator Newman said, to raise these issues of civil liberties, not so much directed against the Health Insurance Commission but directed to the society we live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are really saying to the people we represent who are listening to us today is this: what do they think is the right balance between these things? It is my view in regard to a lot of the legislation coming through at the moment that the balance is going too far in the direction of detection. If we wanted to bug every bedroom, if we wanted to examine every household, there is no doubt we could suppress a lot of crime, but at what cost? In a recent case the High Court said that evidence that was obtained in an unsatisfactory manner, where people's privacy was attacked too much, should not be accepted. I think this debate has been a very important one. Therefore, I wanted to take part in it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of points have been raised that I believe need to be addressed. I would like to make it clear that we are addressing opposition amendments Nos 3 and 4. These are totally unacceptable to the government. Effectively, they would gut this legislation which is a very important tier in the process of pursuing possible evidence of fraud. That is essentially what this legislation is about. It is also legislation that is trying to find the best balance between the civil liberties of the people who may be under investigation&mdash;essentially, medical practitioners, pathologists and pharmacists&mdash;and the civil liberties of citizens who, as we know, are being denied lots and lots of taxpayers' dollars through the fraud that is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point, in picking up and trying to deal with the issue raised by Senator Newman&mdash;which I believe was dealt with very appropriately by Senator Lees&mdash;is that it must be understood this is a level of investigation that falls short of what is a warrantable search. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not necessarily an offence yet. It is only a belief or a suspicion that there might be one. Also, as Senator Lees argued so well, in regard to many of the things that will be brought to the Health Insurance Commission's attention when somebody, for whatever reason, says,`I wonder about what is happening there,' there is a case management committee level. A reference from that case management committee goes to the managing director. Permission has to be signed to go and look. So it is not as though people are rushing in willy-nilly; it is a thoughtful approach which asks for some powers to go and look. I say to Senator Newman that it is an inspection for compliance; it is not a forceful entry or a seizure of evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to reassure Senator Lees, who asked for reassurance that at this stage patients' records may not be investigated, I can certainly give her that absolute assurance. I remind Senator Newman again that this is a balance that has been discussed at length during the committee inquiry, although I understand she was not persuaded by the arguments there. It is a balance that meets the needs of a significant part of the medical profession, the pharmaceutical people and the pathologists; people whose concerns were being taken into account when this legislation was first brought into this place and then referred to the committee, including the AMA, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the Australian Association of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, and others. These people, who know exactly what it means, are not unhappy with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not mean very much. That does not mean to suggest, nor is Senator Newman suggesting, that they are still in ignorance. Is Senator Newman suggesting that the whole medical profession is still in ignorance? That is a rather brave assertion. Maybe <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will be interested to make sure that all of these organisations get a copy of that, because they have had the assistance of going through the Senate committee inquiry, they have had the assistance of legal advice and they have also had a hand in seeing these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments take account of their concerns. I do not believe they will be approved by these organisations in ignorance. That is a very dangerous kind of claim for Senator Newman to make. I again remind her that this is an inspection for compliance; it is not forceful entry, and it is not for seizure of evidence. Quite properly, seizure of evidence needs a warrant, but this section is not for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of other examples of similar kinds of warrantless entry and search or inspection powers in different acts. For example, the New South Wales Medical Practice Act 1992 enables an authorised person to investigate complaints. An authorised person under the National Health Act 1953 can do the same to verify accounting records. An authorised person under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 can do the same to verify accounting records. Under the Ozone Protection Act 1989, an inspector can do the same to ascertain compliance; that is, have entry and search or inspection powers without a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An authorised person under the civil aviation regulations can do the same to ascertain compliance. An inspector under the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 can ascertain compliance. An inspector of the ACT Weights and Measures Ordinance Act 1929 can also ascertain compliance. This is not unprecedented. It is in line with a lot of other areas where, by way of being reasonable and precisely to take account of civil liberties, these kinds of powers are provided to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman argues that this power is not in line with civil liberties, but it is a question of whose civil liberties they are and what balance we are striking. We are concerned that civil liberties do not pertain only to the people under investigation. In exactly the same way, health inspectors can go into restaurants and delicatessens to protect the civil liberties of the people who may eat that food. So why is Senator Newman arguing that this case of inspection for compliance is somehow an invasion of civil liberties but it is not an invasion in all the other acts? I have not actually heard her say that civil liberties are not at risk in all the other acts, but I presume that as these bills have been passed, they are in existence and nobody is raising major complaints about them the balance has been struck on behalf of the civil liberties of all people&mdash;those under investigation and the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this power makes a very big impact in this whole process of pursuing fraud, I argue very strenuously that the points Senator Newman is making are not persuasive at all. This is a two-stage process of trying to ascertain whether there is an offence and then, if in the face of evidence there is, to move with the more powerful warrant, after approval is given for that warrant. Again, that is according to the other procedures for permission for that warrant being sought and approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a very good balance here. I remind Senator Newman again that this is an inspection for compliance; it is not forceful entry and it is not seizure of evidence&mdash;two very critical matters for her reconsideration of this very important point. In the end, we know that medical fraud and pathology and pharmaceutical fraud do happen. It is very difficult to put an amount on it, but the next time she wants to ask what the government is doing about it she might have to be reminded that she is in danger of gutting the very legislation that might assist the taxpayers of this country to recover some of these dollars&mdash;or the Health Insurance Commission on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not legislation that people have rushed into. This is legislation that has been through very extensive discussion and redesign. The government has taken account of so many of the points raised. It has moved amendments that, as I understand the passage of this legislation so far, have been agreed to and accepted&mdash;all to try to strike that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman's amendments, Nos 3 and 4, oppose essentially one-half of the heart of this legislation and will, in the end, very much hamstring the capacity of the government or the Health Insurance Commission to prevent that fraud and see that the civil liberties of citizens are held up with some kind of equality against very properly protecting the civil liberties of the people under investigation. So I strongly oppose Senator Newman's amendments and suggest that she rethink the arguments, in favour of the government's position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to challenge the minister's current explanation and say that I am not persuaded by those arguments. The compliance inspection analogy the minister makes sounds very plausible; however, there is a big difference. In this case that inspection can lead to very serious criminal charges. The minister stressed that that is the importance of conferring those powers. So it is very different from compliance inspection models.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I understand that there is no community support for police powers being extended to not require a search warrant when an inspection or a search is being made that may lead to criminal charges. What we are discussing here is giving powers that the police do not have to agencies that have not been trained to respect the rights of the individuals upon whom they may be intruding. Even in the case of police who are trained to respect those rights, we know that there are concerns about the way those powers are exercised. The principle here is very different from compliance inspection. In this case, powers that the police do not have are being extended to non-policing agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns the minister addresses are real, but there are other alternatives. I believe that we ought not to give powers inappropriately to health insurance commissions; instead, we should work on the professional associations. The minister says that these associations support the principle underlying this particular legislation. They should be encouraged to promote within their professions voluntary permission for compliance inspections. In that way we can use peer pressure and the professional associations themselves can assist the health insurance commissions to prevent medifraud. I believe that that would be a much more constructive way to go. The Greens certainly do not support this legislation, in any case, because of that extension of powers, but we feel that this amendment is worthy of support because it at least counteracts one very damaging aspect of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Chamarette's remarks because she covered two points that I particularly wanted to make in response to the minister. One of those points is that the Australian Federal Police could not exercise these powers without having to get a search warrant. So the extension of the powers to people other than police, giving them powers that the police do not have, is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Chamarette also said, the examples given by the minister were very different because the minister's own amendments make it clear that HIC officers may enter premises if they have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been or is being committed. The minister dismissed that as if it were nothing. We are dealing with criminal offences and potential criminal offences. In those circumstances, it is critically important that a search warrant be required in order to protect the rights of the citizen. The minister quite wrongly&mdash;and I wonder at her motives&mdash;suggested that we were opposing this legislation, or that we were gutting it by supporting the legislation but putting some mechanisms in place to protect the citizen. We can in no way be described as opposing it or gutting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going further than the government in saying that this important purpose to which this legislation is addressed must not at the same time do a wrong to others. We are making sure that the rights of Australians are not lost simply because it is in a good cause. The government seems to have lost sight of the need to get that balance. Despite all that the minister said about balance, she failed to recognise that the only way she will achieve balance, if she gives powers of search, is to give them under certain conditions. She tried to suggest that I was damning all the medical profession as not being concerned about civil rights and not knowing about civil rights matters. I have said that lawyers perhaps are more attuned to civil rights issues than are doctors, but the AMA, for example, has looked at amendments Nos 3 and 4 and has expressed itself as happy with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the remarks of Senator Cooney. He has great understanding of these issues and was chairman of the committee that examined these matters. Certainly he put his finger on a pretty serious problem. Indeed, the minister evidenced this by her litany of examples of those who can go in and do things without search warrants. He said that more and more legislation in this country grants power to go in and inspect people in their homes or workplaces for all sorts of new offences, or to obtain evidence in order to control the citizen in some way. There may be socially desirable reasons, but in this of all places in Australia we should be alert to the restriction on the rights of citizens. No matter how worthy the purpose, we must be careful to see that we do not allow incrementally a position to develop where the rights of Australian citizens are there in name only. </PARA>

This is one place where I believe we must take a stand. I do not believe that it will gut the effectiveness of the act.

I question why the government wants to give more powers to the HIC than it is prepared to give to the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with one of the excellent points made by Senator Chamarette in her remarks, namely that relating to officers authorised to enter and search premises and to seize stuff. Perhaps I should take up the point made by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) that such officers would not have the power to seize material. As I see it, they have power to take extracts or to make copies of material. I am taking into account the proposed amendment 8T. I hope the chair will forgive me for referring to subsequent amendments, but I feel it necessary to do so in order to make sense of the amendments and to check the points made by the minister to the effect that there is no power to seize. I understand that they have the powers as listed in 8T. This leaves aside the privacy matter. I understand that Senator Newman indicated that the matter had been adequately dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the minister indicated that she thought the Privacy Commissioner had apparently notified the government that he felt satisfied that the proposed amendments would cover the privacy area. On the question of seizure, they do have power, but that is another point. However, here authorised officers are provided with entry, search and other powers for which, under normal circumstances, the Australian Federal Police or trained police officers would have had to obtain a warrant. That matter is exercising the minds of all honourable senators and, no doubt, the mind of the government. It appeared to be exercising the mind of Senator Cooney when he got up to speak, and I might mention something about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not a fact that under 8L the authorised officer, with these quite extraordinary powers without warrant, could be anybody who is nominated personally by the managing director? As Senator Chamarette said, where there are warrants required to be obtained, those warrants are in the hands of police officers, who are trained to respect the rights of the individual&mdash;whether that always occurs or not is beside the point. However, those officers are trained in that area and they are fully aware of the ramifications if they do not respect the rights of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not satisfied, from what has thus far been said by the government in this chamber or, indeed, by the officers appearing before the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, that such provisions are in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up on a number of points before I come to the one raised by Senator Harradine. I would say to Senator Chamarette that it is not accurate to say, as she did, that while I talked about warrantless entry and search or inspection powers, they, unlike these, do not lead to criminal charges. In fact, some of them do. It is not an unprecedented example that we are putting into legislation here. In some cases, the evidence provided by those other acts I quoted does lead to the very evidence that leads to criminal charges, and we need to bear that in mind. I do not want to take issue with Senator Chamarette especially because, as I understand, this is a position she has consistently held. Really, I want to correct one of the arguments that I do not find persuasive in her argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette raised the other important point of whether professional peer pressure, that is, compliance investigation by professional colleagues, might work.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence to this point is that, no matter the importance of professional peer pressure, clearly some of the profession are not persuaded by that. Whether or not their professional peers are coming round, we would still have to deal with the very important point raised by Senator Harradine. Would it be fair for the pathologist down the road, designated as an inspector for compliance purposes, to come in and see whether or not another pathologist is doing what he says he does or whether we would have to say, as in answer to Senator Harradine's question, `These people would have to be trained. They would also have to have some kind of understanding of the responsibilities of this sort of work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some information in answer to Senator Harradine's question about training in particular. The balance has been always as to whether the AFP should be given the particular information to know what to look for, that is, the medical pathology and pharmaceutical expertise. The evidence is that the arrangements we have in place at the moment have not been very successful. So we turn now to whether it might be better to train the HIC, which has a much better understanding of what the medical expertise is about, and to see that they are trained to the questions Senator Harradine raised, particularly in relation to the sorts of concerns the AFP has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Health Insurance Commission employs around 30 experienced investigation officers. These officers work with medical advisers and pharmacists as a team. They work through a case management committee process in each state, and that is overseen by a central national case management committee. All officers undertake ongoing training programs and some programs are actually provided by the Australian Federal Police staff college. By the end of this financial year most of the officers will have completed a two-week tailored refresher course at the college and ongoing training programs are planned. The points raised by Senator Harradine are very important and very valid. I believe the Health Insurance Commission is aware of them and is certainly assisted by the Australian Federal Police in providing that kind of assistance for its own investigating officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission investigations are probably more sensitive to and aware of the complexity of the government as a third party financier in the doctor-patient relationship than are the police, who have a general enforcement role. Health Insurance Commission investigators are specifically trained in medifraud. Moreover, they work in tandem with the Health Insurance Commission's medical advisers, that is, with medical professionals. So in some ways that goes part way to the point Senator Chamarette raised, though I do appreciate the difference between voluntary peer review and what we have spelt out here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that will assist Senator Harradine in his concern about whether such people are sufficiently trained. I think that is a very important point. The Health Insurance Commission, I believe, has taken account of that kind of concern. </PARA>

Certainly a balance has to be reached in all of these areas. I suppose in white-collar crime there is a difference. It is a difficult balance to strike in white-collar crime; nevertheless, it has to be struck because of the difficulties of unearthing the evidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been through the arguments before. I ask Senator Harradine to look at Senator Lees's words yesterday in her contribution to this part of the debate. We have tried to strike a balance in two steps&mdash;that is one way of saying it. Everything that Senator Newman has said is possible under this legislation when it comes to forcible entry, seizing of documents or evidence and so on. What we were looking at&mdash;and what we hoped to achieve&mdash;was the prior stage of investigation for evidence of the sorts of things which, if officers have to seek a warrant, may not be there when they come back.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reiterate a point for Senator Harradine. Practical experience to this point has shown that what is happening now is not effective.

There has been agreement at large, in light of all the evidence, that the balance&mdash;as proposed by these amendments to the legislation which have been brought in by the government&mdash;has been struck.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond quickly to something that Senator Crowley said. As I understand it, one reason there has not been sufficient prosecution of fraud cases is this history of relying largely on AFP officers to do the work. As the Senate knows, an enormous number of jobs are given to the AFP, and it has to prioritise. I do not have evidence of this, but I suspect that some of the HIC work may have been designated as lower priority by the AFP than other work which is required of it by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly I believe that there has not been sufficient commitment in the past to chasing fraud. I welcome the fact that now at least we have evidence of a governmental commitment to chase fraud. I think that is one of the big pluses that come out of this whole exercise. But I would not suggest that because these powers have not been there the work was not done. The work was not done because there were other priorities, as much as for any other reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The giving of these powers is important, but so also is the commitment to prosecute and to pursue people operating outside the law. They are innocent until they are proven guilty, and the structure of protection for citizens that we have enjoyed in this country, which is being whittled back, does not need to be whittled back in this case in order to investigate fraud. We can still do it. The powers are there, but a search warrant should be required first. Senator Crowley has not acknowledged, for example, that the taking of samples or photographs in many ways is equivalent to taking away the evidence.

But, in the obtaining of evidence from somebody's premises, some precautions need to be taken first. Therefore, I do not think we should be distracted by the minister saying, `Well, we have not done very well in the past.' The reason for this is not so much one of there not being the powers but one of a commitment and a priority not being given to this work. I welcome the fact that that now appears to be present.

The last thing we want to do is to delay these procedures which are, as I said, welcomed and supported by the Democrats. We believe that an executive decision of this type, which affects the legal rights of people, puts them at risk in our legal system and hands them over to another tribunal, must be subject to scrutiny by a court. We believe that the appeal should be able to be brought before an Australian court, but that the right must be exercised within seven days. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's concern is that if we were to incorporate the sorts of appeal rights and judicial review rights that Senator Spindler talks about, we could very easily be frustrating the work of the International War Crimes Tribunal. We would be frustrating it because, as we have seen quite often&mdash;particularly in my portfolio&mdash;the use of judicial review mechanisms can drag out a process for some three, four or five years.

The Extradition Act contains safeguards and covers a range of situations and arrangements with more than 100 countries.

I think one can draw a comparison between the specific mandate of that tribunal and the whole range of considerations that would fall within the ambit of the Extradition Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The moral and political bankruptcy of the Labor Party and the disdain with which it treats the Australian public are evidenced daily, but they are no better demonstrated than by the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994 that is now before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in introducing this bill pretended it to be part of the government's caring `green' direction&mdash;but in reality it is just another cynical exercise of the Labor Party to buy the second preferences of the Green and Democrat parties and to bribe the left wing faction of the Labor Party&mdash;that is, the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;to pass last year's dishonest budget. That budget broke practically every major election promise the Labor Party made in the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me more than the moral and political bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and we have all come to expect it&mdash;is the fact that the Labor Party sycophants in the Canberra press gallery allow Labor's dishonesty to pass daily, unchallenged. This duplicity is demonstrated by this bill. The Labor Party now supports ethanol enthusiastically. But let me quote to the Senate this gem, deliberately said as it was in answer to a dorothy dixer in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Queensland Government . . . was a vigorous supporter of ethanol. It wanted a 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend to be used in Queensland. This, of course, has been discontinued by the Goss Government since it took office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has been tried as a fuel in only two countries in the world&mdash;the United States and Brazil. In both cases it was a financial disaster. The Brazilian Government provided subsidies worth more than $2.7 billion a year, but the new Government of Brazil is abandoning that program. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend in Australia. . . has two drawbacks: the economic ones and the environmental ones. If the 10 per cent blend were to be an excise-free blend, it would cost Australians $435 million a year in revenue forgone. Subsidies for industry to keep the price below current bowser petroleum prices would amount to another $400 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA>The other area of concern was the `environmental costs' which were described as `prohibitive, and refer to the disposal of liquid wastes from ethanol distillation as `a major problem'. Quoting another person, the person who was saying this in the Senate in 1990 went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Brazil the waste disposal problem had turned rivers black, caused by the effluent coming from ethanol plants.</PARA>
<PARA>That person went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would also increase pressure on marginal lands and on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Who said all that? It was none other than Senator Cook, the minister now responsible for this bill. Four years ago a 10 per cent ethanol blend was bad for the environment and it was a financial disaster. Yet here we have the Labor Party, which is morally and politically bankrupt, today supporting a bill by the same minister who four years ago roundly criticised that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that four years ago I defended ethanol proposals in Queensland because I thought they were good for the sugar industry. But Senator Cook in answer to a dorothy dixer&mdash;something specifically put up by the minister&mdash;rubbished the proposal. Here we are, four years later, because Labor is pandering to the Greens and the Democrats, or what is left of the Greens&mdash;I understand the Greens are about to split up and one of them about to join the Democrats. Certainly what is left of the Greens are being pandered to by the government to try to get their second preferences and also to get through last year's dishonest budget, which should never have been passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this bill that Senator Cook is now proposing, contrary to what he said four years ago? The Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill provides for the payment of a bounty on Australian production of certain types of fuel ethanol. The payment of a bounty to ethanol producers forms part of the government's $36 million three-year lead abatement strategy announced in last year's budget. The strategy was justified by the considerable health risks and environmental damage associated with toxic lead levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the $36 million allocated for the strategy, $25 million has been allocated to the bounty scheme. This will involve a payment of $6 million in 1994-95, $8 million in 1995-96 and $11 million in 1996-97. The bounty scheme will run for three years commencing on 1 July 1994. The rate of payment of the bounty will be 18c per litre and will be payable on defined `new production' of fuel ethanol, where it is produced in Australia from biomass feedstocks sourced from plants and animals grown in Australia and where production exceeds 350,000 litres per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is a volatile liquid which is flammable and toxic and is produced on the fermentation of agricultural crops, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, cereal grain, sweet sorghum and cassava. When mixed into unleaded petrol as a 10 per cent blend, ethanol is an effective fuel requiring no modification to the engines of cars designed for leaded petrol. Blended with petrol ethanol lifts the octane range by three points, taking it into the range at which older cars designed for leaded fuel can operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol has a number of environmental benefits, due mainly to the fact that it burns cleaner than other fuels. These benefits are a reduction in carbon monoxide exhaust emissions of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent; a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and lead levels; and a net reduction in carbon dioxide emission, a major concern in global warming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, ethanol is also produced from a renewable energy resource. But, on the downside, ethanol use can cause aldehydes which are eye irritants and possible carcinogens. The production of ethanol in Australia is constrained by a number of obstacles. Ethanol is more expensive to produce than fuel oils, while low volumes mean that producers are unable to make cost gains from economies of scale. In addition, to produce ethanol competitively and in commercial quantities requires a considerable investment in technology and infrastructure which industry has thus far been reluctant to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol is currently produced in Australia primarily for the chemical industry and sourced from Sarina in the Mackay district of north Queensland not far from where I live. However, the Manildra Group operating in New South Wales sells a portion of its ethanol to the Caltex oil company for fuel purposes. Its plant near Nowra on the south coast of New South Wales has the potential to utilise 100,000 tonnes of wheat to produce 28 million litres of ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caltex blends the ethanol with fuel and distributes the blend through its `Bogus' chain of service stations on the south coast. Caltex has been able to economically trial the sale of its ethanol blend because the New South Wales government has forgone its five per cent fuel excise and the ethanol has been produced as a by-product of the production of gluten in starch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol in Australia is currently produced in two main ways, using either molasses or starch from wheat. The Manildra Group uses starch, while the other major producers operating from north Queensland use molasses. A 1990 paper suggested that all of the Queensland molasses converted to fuel ethanol would be required to produce a five per cent ethanol blend for Queensland use. To provide a 10 per cent ethanol fuel blend for the whole of Australia would need the entire Queensland sugar crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 estimates suggest that a capital investment of $200 million to $300 million would be needed just to make 300 megalitres of ethanol to supply a 10 per cent blend for Queensland's needs. Production of 300 megalitres of fuel ethanol would reduce Australia's import bill for crude oil by about $100 million at a world price of US$40 a barrel. At the current oil price of around US$15 per barrel, this would reduce the import bill by less than $50 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the same land required to produce that 300 megalitres of ethanol could earn $160 million from exported sugar at a price of around 10c per pound&mdash;the average price for 1993 was 10.03c per pound, although the March 1994 average price was around 11.7c per pound. So, whilst using ethanol would reduce the import bill for Australia by reducing the amount we would pay for imported crude oil, it would cost us money because the money we could earn from that same amount of land, through the sale of sugar on the export market, is almost three times what we would save by the reduction in the crude oil price. So, at present there is not much in it for the Queensland sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bounty may produce other more acceptable sources. A 1992 article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quotes a Dr Russell Reeves of APECE Research saying that ethanol can be produced at a cost that is competitive with crude oil prices from woody biomass such as forest thinnings, sawdust, cotton and grain crop stubble, rice hulls, bagasse and waste paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some concern in the industry that, once the bounty is gone, it may not be profitable for Manildra to supply ethanol for fuel. According to sugar industry sources, for ethanol to be competitive, oil has to be at about $40 to $45 per barrel&mdash;it is currently only at $15 per barrel. The cost of production of ethanol is about 45c per litre at the factory gate, whereas the cost of petrol is about 25c per litre at the consumer's market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the research by Trangie Agricultural Research Centre which suggests that ethanol can be produced from agricultural crop residues for 24c a litre. If this is correct we may be getting to a state where ethanol can be produced commercially. However, there is some doubt that ethanol will be used as fuel after the three-year period of the bounty finishes, despite the so-called protection in the bill. There is concern that the production capacity of Manildra, having been expanded by bounty subsidies, will at the end of the three-year bounty period be used to compete unfairly with other producers of industrial ethanol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be registered for the bounty, the bill requires information about the marketing strategy for fuel alcohol, including reduction of pollutants and proposals for short- and long-term environmental considerations. It is necessary to prove the production is so-called new production and that more than 350,000 litres will be produced in each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives the minister for resources and energy responsibility for approving the registration of an individual company based on the information provided. To receive the bounty, the minister must consider that the company will be able to `contribute significantly to the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is of some concern to us that this later criterion is not defined in the act and is rather dependent upon the minister's judgment. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, four years ago the minister was totally opposed to ethanol for all the reasons he gave and this year he is in favour of it. So one would have a lot of doubt about the minister's genuineness and his ability to make a satisfactory judgment on this and any other issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel ethanol has definite advantages for the environment and the community. The main things holding back the industry are the high front-end capital costs and low production volumes. This legislation came into being as a result of the deal made between the government and its subsidiaries&mdash;the left wing factions, the Australian Democrats and the Greens&mdash;at the time of the last budget. It was a $25 million bribe to get the budget through. It is a blight on the Australian public system at the moment that this Labor government simply throws $25 million around to buy its way through the budget. That is what happened last time. We are just throwing away that $25 million of taxpayers' money as a result of the deal done between the government and the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I have some reservations, as I said in my speech, I acknowledge that the proposal is a good one from the environmental point of view and, for this reason, the Liberal and National parties will support the legislation. But we wonder whether enough thought has gone into this bill. We wonder whether the fuel ethanol industry can ever be self-sufficient without subsidies and whether, after the three-year bounty period, ethanol fuel production will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wonder whether it is more likely that this bounty will simply allow another competitor into Australia's current export trade in chemical ethanol but subsidised at taxpayers' expense to the detriment of the existing ethanol export trade based in north Queensland. So, whilst this bill is intentioned, correctly, to get the fuel ethanol industry going, there is a real doubt about whether the industry can exist after three years without subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, all this bill will have done is, at taxpayers' expense, given a competitor the ability to build up the capital works necessary to get its factory going and simply give it that easy, taxpayer subsidised way of building a factory to compete with an existing factory in north Queensland, which got there without subsidies. This bill and the work that Manildra is doing will be good for the grain industry in New South Wales, and that in itself is a reason to support the bill. But we wonder whether it is fair if the only result from this is to use taxpayers' moneys to subsidise the establishment of a factory which will, after the three years, simply compete with an existing industry in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have supported the bill on the basis that it is a bounty for three years only&mdash;and we stress this&mdash;whilst suspecting that the fuel ethanol industry will be viable only if the bounty is later extended. The experience in the USA and Brazil was that when government subsidies were removed the ethanol fuel production ceased. For environmental reasons we are prepared to give the proposal the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, and we hope that the bounty does have the effect of establishing a viable, prosperous fuel ethanol industry that can exist in the future without permanent and distorting subsidies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ian Macdonald was quite right in identifying the genesis of this bill as being an Australian Democrats initiative. He was also quite right in identifying the negotiations which went on during the 1993-94 budget debates with the government as the mechanism which the Democrats were successfully able to use to convince the government that this was a very good scheme to enter into. So I would agree with Senator Macdonald there. However, to impugn the motives of the Democrats is quite wrong. For many decades I have been firmly committed to the proposal that Australia needs to move towards a much greater, and eventually exclusive, use of renewable fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Macdonald and other senators would know that last year Australia imported $4 billion worth of petroleum product and that by the year 2000 that is likely to rise to something like $10 billion; that these petroleum based fuels are non-renewable, both within Australia and globally&mdash;they will run out; and that they are one of the principal causes of greenhouse gas emissions&mdash;one of the principal causes of smog emissions in our major cities and urban centres. For a whole variety of reasons similar to this we do need to move to renewable fuels of which ethanol, in the transport area, is pre-eminently sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding costs, I think one could mount a very credible argument that the only reason that ethanol is not already competitive is that the hidden costs in relation to the use of petroleum&mdash;the costs of depletion, the costs of urban air pollution, the deaths which occur from lung cancer and other diseases in cities&mdash;are not borne as they should be against the use of petroleum. If those costs were factored in it may well be that ethanol and other renewable fuels already would be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bounty scheme which this bill introduces was also initiated by the Democrats. The government chose, in the budget, to increase&mdash;initially, very substantially&mdash;the price of petrol and to increase differentially the price of leaded fuel. The argument which the government used was that this was to discourage the use of leaded fuel, particularly in view of the fact that perhaps half the people who were continuing to use leaded fuel had vehicles that could, in fact, use unleaded fuel. However, there was nothing whatsoever in the government's original proposal which would have allowed those people who had older cars that necessarily used leaded fuel to eventually avoid that increased impost. Given that those people who had the older cars were often less able to cope with this increased price, the Democrats felt that this impost was unfair if the money from that differential simply went into general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we argued very vigorously with the government that at least some of the money from this increased cost of leaded fuel should go into providing an alternative. In the case of Manildra, we were aware of the fact that already 23 service stations in New South Wales were providing ethanol mixes&mdash;10 per cent ethanol in petrol, which was a perfectly satisfactory substitute for leaded petrol for the vast majority of the vehicles that would otherwise require the higher octane fuel and would normally be using leaded fuel&mdash;and that this number could be rapidly expanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that by the end of this year there will be 400 service stations in New South Wales providing gasohol, the 10 per cent mix of alcohol in petrol. It gives the lie to the claim often made by the opposition that the Democrats are opposed to industry. We are strongly in favour of appropriate industry. I would point out that Manildra has already made a $36 million investment as a consequence of the offer of this bounty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, alcohol is not only a renewable fuel but also a very satisfactory substitute for lead in petrol. The government was initially anticipating a phase-out of leaded petrol perhaps by early in the next century. Under this bounty scheme if this three-year window of opportunity is used, as I hope it will be, to make the breakthroughs in the technology which are still required to bring the price of ethanol down&mdash;and I will refer to those in a moment&mdash;then I believe that we will see the phase-out of leaded petrol occur much more quickly. The transition in Australia to a much higher proportion of ethanol in fuel&mdash;eventually 100 per cent ethanol&mdash;as a transportation fuel could occur quite quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the research going on in Australia, which is one of the other benefits of going down this road. As I think many senators would know, there has been excellent research in the University of New South Wales over many years into ethanol as a fuel. Dr Russell Reeves, who has been leading that research, has not only developed the gasohol mix for use in ordinary vehicles but also very successfully developed and patented a mix with diesel fuel&mdash;a 15 per cent diesohol mix. I understand that that diesohol mix is not only being trialled in Australia but is already being trialled in Sweden, another country with a great interest in ensuring that the use of petroleum based fuels does not lead to the environmental damage which it would otherwise do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the little I have seen of that research, it seems extremely likely that the use of that diesohol could well become widespread. I understand that Manildra has been for some time using diesohol in its farm machinery and trucks. As I mentioned, the Action buses in the ACT and the buses in Sydney are trialling the use of diesohol. I am quite sure that that will become a viable and cleaner fuel. Emissions from engines using gasohol and diesohol with respect to not only carbon dioxide but also nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide tend to be lower than the emissions of unmodified fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald also mentioned the derivation of ethanol from crops in north Queensland. I guess he is referring specifically to the use of either sugar or molasses as a feed stock for fermentation into ethanol. There are two concerns that I think one must put up front in relation to those feed stocks. Firstly, those feed stocks tend to be expensive, and that is one of the reasons why alcohol from that source is expensive. Secondly, in a world with growing populations, where one needs to look very closely at food supplies for people, there are serious ethical questions about diverting material that could otherwise be used for food into feed stock for fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the exciting developments that is going on in the University of New South Wales is work on the derivation of ethanol from cellulose. Cellulose is part of the woody material in all plants, the stalks of grain, a large part of the stems of trees, and so on, and is a much cheaper source of starting material for ethanol. It is also abundantly  available. The work that is going on there involves a certain amount of genetic engineering: ideally, putting the appropriate enzymes for the breaking of the cellulose into a bacterium and then the various enzymes for breaking down the sugars which result from that initial digestion of the cellulose, so that in one step one would be able to derive ethanol from cellulose. This can already be done in several steps, but there seems every likelihood that the work in the University of New South Wales will be able to produce very cheap ethanol from that feed stock within the three-year time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important that this bounty be put in place to encourage that development, because Manildra has stood very firmly behind the University of New South Wales in the research work it has been doing. As I have already mentioned, the Manildra company near Nowra has already committed some $36 million to expanding its ethanol production. I certainly do not share Senator Macdonald's concern that that ethanol will be used to compete with other producers of ethanol for the chemical industry and for other purposes at the end of this bounty period. I think Manildra has demonstrated a very firm commitment to fuel ethanol, even before this bounty was put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manildra is in some respects a good example of the way in which companies should be going in terms of closed cycle processing. Manildra began essentially as a flour milling business. It moved on to taking the gluten, the protein fraction, out of the flour and selling that for protein enriched bread, value adding to the flour it produced. It then realised that it had the starch fraction of the flour which it could sell for various purposes, and it did that. It moved on and found that, using particular enzymes, it could ferment that starch to a whole range of sugars which had much higher value. It did that, and it produces things such as glucose and fructose from the starch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To do that it needed a particularly pure form of starch, so it had to purify the starch. It had waste starch left over, which initially, I understand, it was using for spray irrigation on nearby farm land. More recently, it has used what was otherwise waste starch for fermentation to ethanol. So it has used every fraction of the flour to produce a very much value added product. The final material&mdash;the waste water and so on&mdash;still goes out to irrigate pasture on which it fattens cattle. So there is very  much a closed loop in this manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Manildra also will be installing its own power station and that that will further improve the environmental viability, the environmental sustainability, of the plant. It certainly suggests to honourable senators and others who may be listening that, if they want a very good example of a business that uses a natural raw material and squeezes all the value adding possible out of that material, they should go no further than Manildra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that under this bounty scheme there will be other people in Australia who will see the advantages of going down this road. In my own state, on the Eyre Peninsula we have a group of farmers who are very keen to use rain damaged grain as a feed stock for the production of ethanol. It is a much smaller operation than Manildra but nonetheless one that in this case could take a feed stock that has a limited value and turn out ethanol for fuel. This could be turned back onto the farm, making the farmers in that district far more independent of imported fuel&mdash;expensive fuel, as most honourable senators would know&mdash;and turning out a fermentation mash that would have almost the same value as the initial feed stock of rain damaged wheat and barley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, one sees the possibility of very considerable value adding, of a local industry with local employment and local self-sufficiency being developed in which the fuel that is produced remains in the district. If that scheme gets up in the next few years, one may well see similar examples spread around Australia. I hope that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats strongly welcome this legislation. It gives effect to that negotiated agreement between the government and the Democrats. We have been strongly committed to renewable fuels over a long period. That commitment remains firm. Our commitment now is not only to see this legislation passed but also to continue pressing the government in relation to that other portion of the research funding that came under the rubric of lead abatement strategy, to ensure that that also goes back into the fuel ethanol program so that Australia will develop a technology of ethanol from cellulose, producing cheap ethanol which it will then be able to export to other nations in the world. Australia is in no sense unique in needing to go down this road. Every nation will need to go down the road of moving from non-renewable to renewable fuels. The nation that first manages to make this transition will be in an excellent position to take advantage of that invention, that technology, and to export that technology to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the production of ethanol from cellulose, in the application of that ethanol as fuel&mdash;both with petrol and with diesel&mdash;and eventually in the use of pure ethanol fuels in internal combustion engines, Australia stands in a very good position to lead the world to a non-greenhouse, renewable source of transportation energy. This bounty will create that window of opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill is the government's response to its negotiations with the Democrats over last year's budget. It is seeking to provide support for the development of an ethanol fuel industry in Australia as part of the government's supposed lead abatement strategy. Undoubtedly, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is a good thing for our environment, so the coalition does not oppose the passage of this bill, as was indicated earlier by my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald. However, we must wonder whether this government is merely applying a $25 million bandaid to salve its international conscience and to placate small interest groups in an industry whose economic viability is questionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol can be produced either from ethylene or from the fermentation of sugars or starches yielded from a range of  agricultural crops, including grain and sugar. The main benefits of ethanol, in the context of this legislation, are as an extender for petrol and diesel, which assists in the reduction of so-called greenhouse gas emissions. It also provides an alternative source of fuel from fossil fuel feed stocks. But we need to be aware that the large scale production of ethanol in Australia requires significant investment and infrastructure to produce commercially viable quantities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brazil has the most significant ethanol industry in the world. In Brazil ethanol is produced from the domestic sugarcane industry. That yields four billion gallons a year of ethanol. But we need to remember that the ethanol fuel industry in Brazil is economically viable only because, first, in Brazil petrol prices are maintained at an artificially high level; secondly, ethanol fuel receives favourable taxation treatment; thirdly, there are direct government subsidies provided for ethanol fuel; and, finally, as I discovered when I visited Brazil in a delegation a couple of years ago, there is a mandatory legislative requirement that a certain percentage&mdash;as I recall, it was 50 per cent&mdash;of the engines produced in Brazil for its motor vehicle industry have to be produced on the basis that they run exclusively on ethanol fuel. So there is a remarkable degree of government intervention in Brazil to ensure that ethanol is a viable alternative. It obviously adds to the cost of transport in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, that industry in Brazil produces about four billion gallons of ethanol fuel a year. By contrast, the  Australian ethanol industry has very limited production capacity. A recently opened ethanol plant at Nowra in New South Wales&mdash;constructed at a cost of $23 million&mdash;has a maximum annual capacity of 28 million litres. Again, compare that with the four billion litres produced in Brazil. Most of this production is earmarked for the chemical industry. But a small proportion of the Nowra plant's production is supplied to Caltex, which blends ethanol with fuel and markets this under its so-called `Bogus' chain of service stations in New South Wales. The annual volume of `Bogus' fuel sold in the past year was only 20 million litres. Given a 10 per cent blend of ethanol to fuel, this equates to only two million litres of ethanol being used as a fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applicants for a bounty under this legislation are required to provide information to prove that they have a level of new production of 350,000 litres. A Queensland study undertaken in 1989 indicated that an investment of $120 million would be required to create an ethanol industry in Queensland capable of producing 300 million litres per year. Let me add that the Queensland government, having already invested $1.75 million in a joint venture with Queensland Science and Technology Ltd, is now in the position of determining whether an ethanol industry is viable. Does the federal government really hope to create a viable ethanol industry in Australia by spending just $25 million? CSR and Bundaberg Sugar's ethanol production in 1989&mdash;currently used for the production of rum, methylated spirits and solvents rather than for ethanol fuel&mdash;was 50 million litres per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although current research indicates that there are sufficient agricultural crop residues in the Macquarie, Gwydir and Namoi valleys to produce 820 million litres of ethanol a year, it takes 100,000 tonnes of wheat to produce 28 million litres of ethanol. Certainly there is no doubt that there is a spin-off from the ethanol industry for the agricultural sector. Producers of wheat, sorghum, corn and sugarcane would benefit from the purchase&mdash;at a collection fee of $30 a tonne&mdash;of agricultural residues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The encouragement of a new industry with positive benefits for Australia should be lauded; but the cost of developing this new industry must not be overlooked. Moreover, the background to the government's strategy in this field is important. In October 1990 the government announced its intention to implement the Toronto target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent of 1988 levels by the year 2005. The stringency of this policy placed Australia in the position of a world leader in greenhouse gas emission reductions. Of course, in the government's desire to make itself internationally popular, it completely ignored the fact that the total contribution by Australia to gas emissions is indeed very small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, naively suggested that the stabilisation of emissions by the year 2005 could be achieved without harming Australian industry but that it would require substantial structural adjustment. Apparently, this would be achieved through what she described as cost-effective, energy saving `no regrets' policies. `No regrets' emission reduction  measures are those that supposedly offer economic and environmental benefits, apart from any lessening of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment was in response to considerable hysteria on the subject of global warming, notwithstanding that many of the statistics quoted then on global warming failed to take into account the effects of global cooling caused by atmospheric sulfides from acid rain and volcanic ash. Now, only a couple of years later, the CSIRO estimates that the greenhouse impact will be less than half of the estimates used in the predictions by the Australian government in formulating its policies and strategies resulting from its participation in the Rio Earth Summit, Agenda 21 and the subsequent conventions on climate change and biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to remember that ethanol itself is not without environmental consequences. In emissions created where ethanol is used as a fuel additive, high levels of aldehydes are created&mdash;these are both eye irritants and possible carcinogens. We need to be aware of that downside as far as the environment is concerned. It perhaps balances some of the claimed benefits of ethanol as a fuel. The London economics group of BHP released a study in 1992 which stated that implementing policies to achieve the Toronto target would destroy Australia's steel and aluminium industries and cripple the steaming coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of our enormous reserves, Australia has a fossil fuel based economy. We are the world's biggest coal exporter and the world's second biggest exporter of aluminium and iron ore. Nearly 90 per cent of Australia's electricity is generated in coal fired power stations. Australia does not enjoy greenhouse-free nuclear power because, with the ready availability of coal, nuclear power is not economically viable. Even so, Australia produces less than two per cent of total world greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Industry Commission showed that annual Australian losses by the year 2005 from global application of the Toronto target would amount to 1.5 per cent of Australian national output. That represents about $6 billion a year and the loss of 50,000 to 75,000 jobs. That is hardly something that we can sustain or justify with the current enormous levels of unemployment suffered by people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite former Minister Kelly's assurances, made to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in February 1992, that there would be no coal tax&mdash;a tax which, to meet the Toronto emission target, would need to be levied at $153 a tonne, thus raising the price of coal by more than 200 per cent&mdash;we have seen in media reports as recently as last week that the government is again considering a greenhouse gas tax. Less than two years ago the then minister said there would be no carbon tax, yet in the last week we have seen that it is again on the agenda. Of course, that will be a substantial cost to industry, to economic growth and to the economic wellbeing of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that next week's budget will see proposals for an energy tax as a substitute for state payroll taxes. Certainly the Liberal and National parties support the abolition of payroll taxes&mdash;a direct tax on jobs&mdash;and the consequent job opportunities that would be derived from the  abolition of that tax. An exchange of payroll tax for a greenhouse gas tax on industry&mdash;even allowing for the absence of an excise tax on ethanol as a fuel and with the addition of the bounty&mdash;would place in great jeopardy any possible generation of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is now renowned for giving tax benefits or tax reductions with one hand and taking them back immediately with the other. As we know only too well, it is a tax and spend government. It does not know how to manage government finances, and it does not know how to save on expenditure, so its rapacious desire for tax revenue rises inexorably. Quite clearly, if it is going to abolish payroll tax it will, it would appear, introduce this so-called greenhouse gas tax, a tax on energy, as an alternative source of revenue. The government will try to dress it up as an environmental measure when, in reality, it is nothing more than the government's incapacity to match its spending with its available revenue.

As I was saying before the interruption, Dr O'Brien presented a paper in February 1993 when he commented that the commitments made by Australia under the auspices of the Rio Earth Summit were made during a period when Australia was in the depths of a recession and, in his view, had effectively nationalised the environment without establishing any clear benefit to it whatsoever. It is feared that with a recovering Australian economy these commitments may be pursued more vigorously, obviously to the detriment of that economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the government about how we need to improve our capacity to export into the Asian region and that that is where our future lies. Of course, it is a very important market for Australian goods and services. If Australia is to have a prosperous future we must do business successfully in the Asian area. We need to remember that many Asian countries with rapidly growing economies are not signatories to various United Nations conventions. So this country, Australia&mdash;our own country&mdash;is left, unable to compete with those economies, because they are not burdened by the cost obligations of those various international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March of this year, whilst discussing carbon dioxide emissions, former Senator Richardson referred to the high degree of synergy between the target adopted by Australia and Australia's commitments and principles in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As recently as April 1994 the government was criticised by parties attending the consultative forum on international environmental issues&mdash;including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, Community Aid Abroad and the Council for Overseas Aid&mdash;for failing to meets its commitments and obligations under United Nations conventions. Ministers Evans and Faulkner agreed that they would consider the points raised by these organisations. So here we see the government coming under the influence of these organisations which are proposing policies which would be detrimental to the Australian economy and to the wellbeing of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be a simple point, but it is often missed, that many developing nations refused to sign the conventions unless they were given assurances of aid that would help them buy energy efficient fuels. The `north-south&mdash;who pays?' debate is not a new issue. Australia and New Zealand, as part of the developed, so-called `north' nations, are therefore required to contribute aid to developing nations which are not restrained by being signatories to these UN conventions and which can therefore continue to do whatever they like.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recent example of this is the international convention on desertification which is currently under negotiation. Quite apart from the issue of the abdication of sovereignty which this convention involves, it deals almost exclusively with aid for African countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst supporting this legislation, there are a number of serious shortcomings in the government's approach to this issue which I have sought to highlight. I conclude by saying that two years ago the government committed us to a 20 per cent reduction in the level of greenhouse gas emissions that were evident at that time, but it had absolutely no understanding of how that was to be achieved. This bill may go some way towards achieving that goal, but it must be recognised that it will not be without cost to our standard of living and job creation in Australia. This government, while taking advantage of the international posturing in which it engaged in 1990, when it comes to the bottom line is really only paying lip-service to its commitments to the environment, and it is doing that at some cost to our economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill, as we have frequently stated in the past, the Greens (WA) see a fundamental problem with the ongoing commitment to the private motor car as the major means of personal transport. It is not and never will be equitable. It results in a massive resource use and is a major contributor to energy use, pollution and particularly airborne emissions. The dependency on oil creates additional problems, economically and environmentally. The presumption of car ownership is built into our cities in a way that greatly increases the cost of urban infrastructure, while having very negative effects on equity and other social factors. We stress the need for a real and direct move to address these issues and reduce the dependency on private motor vehicles, particularly those run mainly on carbon based fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Use of fuel ethanol and gasohol cannot advance these aims on its own. Nevertheless, we support this bill since, as an additive, this fuel provides a better option for increasing octane ratings, making it a potential alternative for leaded petrol. I call on Senator Ian Macdonald to note that this proposal relates to ethanol as an additive rather than as an alternative fuel on its own. Lead emissions are a problem, and cars are the major source of such emissions. While we would like to see legislation designed to reduce the levels of lead in petrol with a definite phase-out date, we recognise that it is important to create alternatives; and this is one such alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald spoke mostly of the cost and probable need for continued subsidy. We initially also thought that the three-year period may not be long enough. We are assured by industry that new processes are being developed that will drastically reduce costs and that this bounty is in large part what it needs to carry it over the development period. In short, industry is happy with the three-year period. Note that, while sugar has been used and proposed as the basis for an alternative stand-alone, fuel alcohol industry, the current development area is in the use of waste starches from the food industry. The proposal at the moment is for ethanol as an additive to replace lead, which is used to increase octane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens also support the amendments put by the Australian Democrats. These are primarily designed to avoid the problem that has arisen. This bounty is intended to support the development of a fuel ethanol industry. So far, one company has shown the commitment and courage to actually take this challenge on and start producing fuel ethanol. It is strongly committed to improving its processes and to developing the industry. Yet, under the current wording, that company would be penalised. It would be the only one penalised. Although this company has just started production, all its current production would be considered ineligible as `new production'. This is simply not fair and penalises the very people who should be congratulated if the intent of the bill is recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments are designed to make sure that those entering the industry are legitimate developers. They would exclude those who do not have a commitment to process improvement, including improving environmental consequences of production. We support these also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One additional issue is not addressed in the amendments, and I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to it. Under clause 28 there is a guarantee of an appropriation. This is fine. Under subclause 29(1), provision is made for the comptroller to recognise valid claims in excess of the appropriated funds in clause 28. This is also fine since, otherwise, the valid claims of some would not be honoured. Unfortunately, subclause 29(2) then says that, where the money is not appropriated, no additional bounty can be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that, unless the government makes a commitment to appropriate required funds, either some valid claims will not be honoured or funds will be allocated on the basis of partial payments. It says in the explanatory memorandum that this varies from most schemes. It does indeed. Here we have a situation where a bounty is given to stimulate an industry and then set up in such a way that the industry will expect a certain bounty and may receive less or nothing. For a  government that cites the need for `investor confidence' as a  reason to deny claims to the environment and social justice, it seems strange that it could happily create such uncertainty. Perhaps there is such a bias against the environment that the government thinks any industry with a whiff of greenness should be penalised. Let me reassure honourable senators that supporting the private motor car is not terribly green, and it is probably okay to treat fuel alcohol like other industries getting bounties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, we will support the bill and the amendments but would like to see eliminated the strange arrangement where a bounty is not really to be paid as stated or where it is not to be paid equally. We would like to see a commitment by the government to the principle that the level of bounty set will be the level paid and all valid claims shall be honoured. This could be done by eliminating subclause 29(2) but, at a minimum, it should be through an undertaking that, in the case of shortfall, additional appropriations will be put up and supported by government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second amendment to be moved by the Democrats was to clause 6, page 3. The purpose of this amendment was, as I think Senator Margetts pointed out, to avoid penalising the excellent work Manildra has done over some considerable time before the bounty actually comes into operation. The bill as it stands would have the effect that a company which had entered into production earlier might well be penalised permanently throughout the bounty period by reason of the fact that it had made this production before the bounty scheme began.</PARA></TALK.START>

The amendments in their original form did go from my office to Mr Prosser and were discussed with him this morning by a staff member. What has actually happened in relation to this changed wording is that, in speaking to me this morning about this wording, the minister's staff pointed out that there may well be a relatively minor technical difficulty. If one says `hydrocarbons including benzene'&mdash;I think Senator Macdonald would understand this point; with his legal background he certainly should&mdash;one might then argue, if this matter were ever litigated, that by implication other hydrocarbons were excluded. Therefore, the wording was changed from `including benzene' to `including benzene and other aromatics'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those who are observant may be aware of a number of questions on notice concerning overseas students that I have addressed to the minister responsible for the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Certainly the department and the minister have become aware of these questions and some sections of the media are beginning to realise that Australia has a pretty shabby record in this area. It began in the mid-1980s, when Mr Dawkins was Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The government at that stage discovered a new, lucrative source of income in the form of thousands of Asian students needing to learn English and to undertake other studies by coming to Australia and paying for the courses in private colleges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With government promotion, demand steadily increased. In 1986, the government streamlined overseas student entry provisions and introduced a student visa system which entitled students who had been accepted into an accredited course, after paying full fees, to a visa entry to Australia on the presentation of an official acceptance advice form. That policy was successful. A dramatic increase in the number of fee-paying students resulted, with student arrivals increasing by 800 per cent between 1986 and 1989 in the ELICOS sector alone. Servicing this increase led to an explosion in the number of private education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be emphasised that until January 1990 the Department of Employment, Education and Training accredited private institutions to provide English and business courses to overseas students. The criteria by which institutions were accredited included management, course content, premises, qualifications of staff, welfare services to students and financial viability. I specifically emphasise that last criterion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1987, an inspection by an independent panel of experts was needed for the initial and provisional accreditation, which was to be followed by a further inspection. According to the minister, a further inspection by an independent panel of experts was required to confirm that institutions could demonstrate that they offered high standards of English instruction and business practice and that they continued to meet the above criteria. If an institution successfully demonstrated that it met these requirements, full accreditation was granted on an indefinite basis, subject to review every three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am emphasising these points to illustrate the degree of accreditation, examination and supervision of these expanding institutions. On the basis of this accreditation, encouraged by the minister and his department, institutions actively sought overseas students. However, while the initiative worked in the sense of increasing the numbers and in terms of fees being paid, other concerns were being expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested that the new, relaxed visa arrangements were being exploited by some students and some institutions, and it was said that the regulations allowed what were called `non-genuine' students, primarily interested in working in Australia, to enter Australia too easily. For example, one report from 1990 that I have seen quotes a departmental adviser at a seminar telling his audience that ELICOS had become, in his words, `a non-compliance nightmare', and that it had `contributed to the overstay problem'. I quote from a letter to me from Minister Crean of 3 March this year, which refers to `serious concern about the large number of overseas students, particularly from China, breaking Australian migration law either by remaining in Australia after completion of their studies or using the educational programs, particularly ELICOS, as a means of back door migration'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these so-called concerns, some relatively minor modifications were made to the visa system in 1987 and 1988. In August 1989 the government introduced new, tighter entry conditions to visa applicants in a move which, according to Minister Crean, was to deal with the perceived overstay problem. New checks on bona fides were instituted, a minimum educational level was required, an age limit of 35 was introduced, and dependants were not permitted to accompany students. In addition, institutions were told not to issue advice acceptance forms to new students from the People's Republic of China. The minister claims that this was done with the cooperation of private colleges, and with the expectation that refunds would have to be made by the educational institutions which had taken fees from prospective students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in September 1989 refers to 25,000 students being involved. This is no matter of small concern, this is a matter of great national importance: 25,000 students were involved in 1989. That is, 25,000 potential students had paid fees which were reportedly up to $5,000 each, and had been accepted into colleges; but suddenly, in order to gain a student visa they had to meet changed conditions&mdash;conditions which were different from those they had originally been informed about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the expectation of ongoing student numbers, the colleges had made financial commitments for their courses. They had arranged extra accommodation, they had paid for printing, extra staff had been engaged, et cetera. You can imagine the amount of money involved in that, Mr Acting Deputy President. An estimate at the time was an expected loss to private accredited colleges of at least $25 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around October 1989 an agreement was reached between the government and the industry that refunds, with an additional payment of $100 each, would be issued by the colleges to each of the students who were to be denied entry under these new, arbitrarily applied conditions. The government would investigate the case for financial assistance to institutions which suffered cash flow problems as a result of the cutback in students. It is claimed that the government reneged on this arrangement. The arrangement had been with private colleges, and the government reneged by imposing such harsh conditions for eligibility for government loans that not one loan application was granted for the full amount of the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the story from then on. Many colleges collapsed and went out of business as the number of students dried up. For example, whereas in 1989 and 1990 there were more than 20,000 visas issued by the Beijing embassy, in 1990-91 following the crackdown there were 1,579&mdash;from anything up to a possible 40,000 applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal budget of June 1990 provided $50 million for loans to colleges to enable the department to provide direct refunds to students who had been denied an entry visa. The plan was to later recover the money from the institution with which the student had been enrolled. According to the minister, as at January 1994, a total of $66.076 million has been paid to students and $3.978 million has been recovered. Of the institutions involved, some 60 per cent have closed, with many in liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has provided a breakdown of the $62.098 million which has not yet been recovered. The amount owed if pending court cases or liquidations are successful is $33.926 million; the amount to be paid under negotiated or court sanctioned agreements is $1.091 million; and the amount to be written off is $6.746 million. The remainder of that, $20.335 million, is obviously not calculated in that breakdown. We can only presume that that also needs to be written off. I venture to suggest that the $33.9 million that is supposed to be forthcoming, if pending court cases and liquidations are successful, is an ambitious expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recovery program is implemented by what is known as the China task force. Since 1990 this force has cost us, the taxpayer, $4.3 million to administer. The whole project has cost us $70 million. All we know is that about $3.9 million has been recovered to this point. Where the rest is coming from is a matter of some considerable conjecture. None of this takes account of the cost of compliance measures that have to be put in place by the colleges. Various observations suggest that that cost may be an additional $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent answers to questions the minister attempted to praise the results of the government's overseas education initiatives. He praised the growth in the university sector. It recorded an income from educational exports in 1993 of $710 million compared with only $115 million in 1988. That praise is indeed properly given. However, the figures the minister quoted showed an increase in the private sector of only $190 million, including a substantial reduction in the English language sector from $200 million in 1988 to $120 million in 1993. Why? Is it true, as some in the industry have suggested, that the department's real goal is to eliminate the private colleges from the field? Is this government policy? If it is not policy, it would seem that the department has certainly got it wrong. It has obviously failed to implement whatever the government policy is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any analysis of proper management, the initiation, encouragement, establishment of goals and purpose, and the monitoring and evaluation of overseas exports of education by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and the government, have been an unmitigated disaster. Scores of businesses have collapsed, individuals have been financially crippled, millions of dollars of taxpayer's money has been squandered and Australia's reputation has been perhaps irrevocably damaged. Even though an inquiry by the Industry Commission resulted in some changes to the act, I would suggest that it was after the horse had bolted. No-one has been asked to take responsibility or even been required to explain the many inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the minister are attempting to explain it all away in terms of past mistakes now rectified. But it is simply not good enough; too many fundamental questions remain about the way the department is managed, about the way it evaluates and monitors its performance and about the way it sets its goals. Why were colleges required to refund any fees when they had already acted on a policy initiative of the government to expand education exports that had been accredited by the department, as I have explained, after `appropriate' checks and after they had followed government and departmental directives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If increasing rates of `overstay' were causing concern, why did not the department's investigation of reports from colleges enable offenders to be identified and deported? Why was not the problem, so-called, properly examined and rectified in a manner other than a unilateral crackdown on providing visas to innocent students who had paid fees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it true that only private colleges were forced by the department to keep meticulous records of attendances of overseas students, but not universities and government colleges? Again, why were these private college records not adequately monitored and acted upon? If private educational institutions were `cashing in' on a desire for a backdoor immigration path, why did the accreditation monitoring not identify such colleges? We had the accreditation in place. Surely the monitoring was taking place and surely it was possible to identify such colleges. If so, it is not clear that anything was done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that the exciting, brave new world of millions of dollars from exports of education, initially seen to be available to the private sector, has taken a back seat to providing a source of income for universities? There is nothing particularly wrong with universities making a profit out of it, but that has been pursued to the disadvantage of the other sectors. One has to ask: what effect will this have on the tertiary education system of the future? There are many fundamental questions still to be answered. The evasion so far does not provide any reason to be confident that the Department of Employment, Education and Training is properly set up or structured to meet its responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity today to raise a matter which I have raised previously, the first occasion being on 31 May 1990, when I spoke about the Multiple Sclerosis Society of the Australian Capital Territory, its facilities here and the government's failure to recognise the benefit of those facilities. I am speaking this week because it is Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. The society is running a number of functions to let people who have multiple sclerosis, who have recently contracted it and who are perhaps not aware of the society, know what services are offered and what goes on. There is to be an open day so that people can visit and find out what can happen at the society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason why I am pleased to raise this matter at this time. There is now a new minister for health, Dr Lawrence, and I want to make a plea to her to have a look at the situation that exists. I hope she will have enough sense and compassion to understand that the academic rules that operate under the Disability Services Act have precluded the respite care centre from being able to operate in the manner for which it was constructed. I hope she will go there and, understanding the need for the facility to operate as it should, make funding available in the same way as it is made available in other circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The society in the ACT was incorporated in November 1978 to offer facilities for people with multiple sclerosis, not just in the ACT but in the area. The society has been significantly funded by Miss Gloria McKerrow. She has been most generous in relation to the construction of both stages of the proposal. The facility is not far from here&mdash;about seven minutes away at the most&mdash;in the suburb of Deakin. It comprises a day care centre, which was built first, and some fairly small administrative offices. The day care centre is a place that people suffering from multiple sclerosis can visit to meet other people, to discuss their common problems and complaints, to take part in activities and generally to enjoy being away from their homes and in an environment where they can mix with other people for a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The premises were built in three stages, not just at the whim of somebody deciding to build it but only after careful and detailed consultation with people suffering from multiple sclerosis to ascertain what members of the society and their families believed would be of benefit and assistance to them&mdash;some offices, the day care centre and, perhaps most needed, some respite beds. The respite beds were a second stage of construction. This consisted of a four-bedroom unit within what looks like a small cottage adjacent to, but not attached to, the day care centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some reason, this has run foul of the Disability Services Act&mdash;of course, the act is not only what is put into place; it is the way it is interpreted. It is an absurd academic criterion that says that, because this place is not in a residential area, it cannot be funded. The respite care house is no more than half a kilometre from housing in the suburb of Deakin. If it were amongst those other houses, apparently, it could get funding for respite care. But, because it is next to the day care centre, it is precluded. I defy anybody to explain to me the logic of interpreting the rules in this way. People who want to go there, or need to go there for respite care, would be glad, on the days that they are there, to have the opportunity to go to the day care centre&mdash;some yards away&mdash;where they could meet and enjoy the company of other people during that brief period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, from 1989&mdash;when the centre was opened&mdash;for those absurd reasons it has not been able to operate with government funding as a respite care centre. It has operated to a limited extent with the limited funds the society has had available to it. This is not the way it was intended to operate but still the absurdity goes on. Those going there this week to inspect the facilities as part of awareness week will see what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more than 100 members in the society who may need, and like, to have access to the respite care centre from time to time. I think everybody agrees that people like to live in their own homes and that the facilities should enable them to do so. Respite care is available in people's home. A carer can move in to look after somebody for a period of time but it is not always possible and it is not always in the best interests. There are times&mdash;for example, when a house needs to be painted or have a new roof put on it&mdash;when respite care, away from the principal place of residence, is absolutely reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, why does the respite care house have to be in a suburb? Why cannot it be half a kilometre away from that suburb next to the day care centre, so that during the day the person in the respite house could move to the enjoyable surroundings of the day care centre, and be able to take part in craft activities or book readings or whatever else might be going on there at the time? My plea to Dr Lawrence is that she have a look at this piece of absurdity and do something about it. This respite house is sitting there not being adequately used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that people with multiple sclerosis in the ACT are not able to get access to respite care. They are eligible for respite care in their own home&mdash;whereby a carer goes to them&mdash;in the same way that other people are under the scheme. With the number of people suffering from multiple sclerosis in our community, a four-bedroom respite care house would probably not be adequate, if that were the only place where they could get respite care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to have a carer go into the home is a part of providing respite care, and this other facility is another part of the care. The facility has a most beautiful view across Woden Valley and the Brindabella Ranges. Anyone who goes there will see that it is purpose-built. It is a really nice small house with suitable bedrooms and suitable space for carers. People can go there for two or three days, or perhaps a week, if need be, and enjoy being in those surroundings&mdash;and make use of the other facilities available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I have talked about this before and it is still beyond my comprehension that this should be the case. There are a number of young people with multiple sclerosis in our society and the only place they can live if they are not able to be accommodated at home is in a nursing home. That is another aspect of this matter. One might decide that young people should be able to live in this facility for at least part of the time and be amongst others of a similar age, as against those with whom they are forced to mix at the present time. It is another aspect of this story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the principal story stands on its own. That society has raised funds to build these facilities. It has had some government assistance with the day care centre. It has raised the capital sums involved but the money provided and made available by the federal government for respite care cannot be used at this facility because of the absurd academic rules. They seem to have been laid down with absolutely no consideration for the needs of the people concerned or the desires that they had when they expressed the view that a facility right there would be of great benefit to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a number of ministers for health; some have even expressed concern about it and shown interest. I know Dr Blewett visited the facility; I was there at the time. I thought he understood the problem; I thought he recognised the benefits that flowed from the place as it was, but nothing happened. Somewhere out there, there seem to be people pulling strings who say, `If you don't fit in with our rules, you don't get any consideration, no matter how sensible what you're doing might be.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So today, in Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week, I make a personal plea to Dr Lawrence to whom I have written. `Please go and have a look at the facility. Please look at it from the point of view of people with multiple sclerosis who could get real benefit from being able to use this place. Please make funding available for them to use it as a respite centre. Do not allow yourself to be tied up in rules and red tape and do not allow yourself to deny the small amount of funding which would make life simpler and more comfortable for some of those people with multiple sclerosis in our community.'</PARA>

<TITLE>Rural Crisis</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="186" SPEAKER="Lees Sen M.H." NAMEID="8U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (1.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again highlight the crisis facing rural Australia. I question whether, unless there is a commitment from government now in mid-1994, there is any future for many farming families. Last session my colleague Senator Woodley and I detailed the dire situation being faced by many rural communities where farmers have high levels of debt and very low incomes. Indeed, in many cases they have no income at all, with commodity prices at record lows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would like to look particularly at the experience of the wheat and barley growers in my home state of South Australia. The majority of these farmers are in areas where they cannot diversify due to the various geographic features of their location. Many of these growers have experienced two very good years, particularly in the Mallee. Two very good seasons have seen record levels of production, better than anything they have ever achieved before. However, the financial hardship continues thanks to the incredibly low incomes. In other words, the incomes that have been generated, even by these record crops, have not met the basic costs of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the average farm figures across Australia, we see that we are looking at incomes for many of about $50 a week if they are lucky. The unsustainably low levels of income are placing huge stresses on farm families. They are the direct cause of many suicides. The low levels of income are also impacting on machinery investment. In many regions the lack of machinery investment is creating problems with both efficiency and productivity. Low incomes also impact on environmental programs and lead to land use patterns that are not sustainable. They threaten the excellent work being done by landcare programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at machinery problems. These are being experienced by many farmers in the Mallee. They simply cannot get the job done quickly enough with the old machinery that they are forced to continue to use. In marginal farming areas, the timing of planting is crucial. If there are continuing machinery problems, the results can simply be that the acreage planted is less than it should be. Therefore, productivity drops and there is less grain for the export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low incomes are forcing many farmers in 1994 to look at what they are going to plant, and many farmers are reducing their plantings substantially. I have a couple of examples, again from the Mallee. Two brothers, who two years ago sowed 3,300 acres of barley, will this year sow only 1,400 acres, as their finances simply do not permit anything more. At the other end of the scale, on a much smaller property another farm family, which normally sows around 800 acres, will this year sow only around 500 acres due to the low commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds from talking to farming groups throughout this region of South Australia, and indeed across South Australia, that this situation goes on and on. The suggestion is that we may see some 30 per cent less grain being planted this year than should be planted. If this trend continues, there will not be enough grain produced to service the export markets that have been built up over many years. In the 1990s, farmers are having to cope with grain prices lower than they were in the 1970s, but the input costs, of course, are in 1990 figures. In other words, the prices of Australian wheat and barley have fallen to levels far below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lower prices have been caused by the protracted trade war between the United States and the European Union. They have nothing to do with the effectiveness of our farmers. They are the most productive farmers in the world. If we could level the playing field tomorrow, we would do very nicely. Unfortunately, as the government has found to its cost and to the cost of our farmers, a level playing field is a myth, and I doubt whether we will ever get anywhere near that situation. Subsidised sales from both sides&mdash;from the European Community as well as from the United States&mdash;have slashed world prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers I spoke to believe that basically they have three options. The first is that they can go ahead and plant, knowing that the current prices will mean that they will lose money, much of which is borrowed, unless seasonal conditions are so favourable for a third year in a row that they get absolutely extraordinary levels of production yet again. The second choice is to go ahead and plant and hope that prices will rise by harvest time, but they do that in the knowledge that the final GATT agreement cleared the way for more subsidised grain from the US and the European Community to flow on to the world market. The third choice is not to plant at all and watch the United States and Europe take over Australia's traditional markets, with Australian becoming known on the international market scene as an unreliable supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the only response the farmers seem to be getting from the government is, `GATT is going to solve everything. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.' The farmers believe that, from the year 2000, there may well be benefits, but how do they get to the year 2000? Once those benefits begin to flow, they see a future. But until we get there, between 1994 and the year 2000 all the indicators point to grain growers having the hardest time of their lives just to survive. They do not have anything spare to draw on to get them through these years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government does not act now, there could be a number of serious consequences. There could be an increased population shift from rural areas of Australia into the cities. This is occurring now, and it could well increase. While farmers are highly skilled in their particular trades, many of them have no formal qualifications. Many are aged over 40, an age when it is extremely difficult not just to get a job but to get into a whole new career. Most farmers, I imagine, will be destined to spend at least some time in unemployment queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another probability is that farm families will be displaced, and that will open the door to corporate farming ventures in which profit will be the sole motive. Not only will this mean a continued massive loss of people, if not the loss of towns, in rural Australia, but I believe it will also be an environmental disaster, as they will not take care of that very fragile landscape. Eventually, the cost of repairing that landscape will have to be met by the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we could have developing, and this has been put to me by people as I have visited rural Australia over the last few weeks, is a peasant class. Indeed, many argue that that has already been created. Many farm families are hanging on, surviving on a subsistence basis, not even able to sell their farms if they want to because there simply are not any buyers&mdash;or there are no buyers with any sort of a price that would leave the farmers with anything with which to move to the city. Then, of course, there is the loss of export markets if we simply do not go ahead and produce the grain. One set of arguments suggests, `No worries, we'll go back in the year 2000 and get back into the markets.' But the fact is that the people with all the infrastructure and the expertise needed to produce those grains simply will not be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Woodley and I stated in February, there needs to be a commitment from government, a change of political will, a commitment that something will be done about the rural crisis in Australia. The grain growers have been meeting across South Australia and have been calling for a variety of possible assistance measures, most of which are available in other developed countries. They believe that these assistance measures would provide a stimulus for investment, employment and productivity as well as reduce the enormous stress levels on farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costings I have seen suggest that these measures would be less costly than funding farmers and their families through the range of support services they are going to need if they do end up in the cities; that is, support through the CES, the DSS, housing support and additional support through the health system. As all the statistics show us, people on low incomes with very high stress levels have a much greater call on the Medicare system than do those people who have a reasonable level of income and far less stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After four years of depression, Australia's farmers, farming families and communities have run down machinery, run down farm infrastructure&mdash;fences, et cetera&mdash;and very low morale. Public infrastructure such as railways is disappearing, and roads are getting worse as more and more of what was sent on the railways is now going on road. We see local governments not able to recoup part of their costs; we see rates not being able to be paid; we see lower school enrolments; and we see other public and private services disappearing. We see further pressure on the local policeman. Do they even keep one or can they simply operate from a district police centre? We see hospitals under threat and, indeed, some are faced with closure. Even churches are struggling to keep their presence in communities. It is time the government acted to ensure that as many Australian farmers as possible reach the next century so that those benefits that they perceive, those benefits that GATT promises, may actually be able to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that time is of the essence. We cannot leave this problem another year; we cannot see the government sit on its hands for even another six months. As time is of the essence, the Democrats will be looking at extending the terms of reference of the inquiry that has just been set up to look into the rural adjustment scheme. We believe those terms of reference should be extended along the lines of what the grain growers are requesting. Those extended terms of reference would be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the current structure and competitiveness of the wheat and coarse grain industry includes the identification of strengths and weaknesses;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)an examination of the contribution of the industry to the Australian economy, including its contribution to the further development of regional economies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the potential for further development of the industry, including the identification of export market opportunities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)identification of any impediments to growth and exports, and any measures which could be undertaken to remove such impediments or otherwise contribute to the growth or export development of the industry, in ways that are consistent with the principles of efficient resource use within the Australian economy;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)implementation strategies for any suggested measures;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)the effect on the industry, consumers, and the economy in general of any measures recommended.</PARA>

The task is to achieve the highest possible level of employment and the lowest possible level of unemployment. What that has tended to mean in most people's perception in recent years, although there is by no means universal agreement about this, is that an unemployment rate in the order of, at best probably, five per cent&mdash;maybe even a little worse than that; six or seven per cent, but certainly about five per cent&mdash;is realistically what most people these days in the OECD and elsewhere around the developed economies would regard as the highest achievable level of employment. I am not sure exactly how the employment minister would currently define that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Was it his Prime Minister who described the 1992 One Nation statement as `the largest single package of constructive measures that I have been associated with', the 1990 pre-recession budget as `the Rolls Royce of budget documents', the 1989 pre-election budget as `a budget that puts the nation's interests first' and, of course, the infamous 1988 budget as `the one that brought home the bacon'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as transport and communications is concerned, I think that the utility of that particular conjunction of portfolios at that stage was because the government business enterprise issue ran right across the whole spectrum of that combined portfolio. Exactly the same set of issues were involved in terms of corporatising and then creating the conditions for privatising the major government business enterprises in every component of that whole spectrum of transport and communications. As that issue of corporatisation, and subsequently in some areas privatisation, was steadily resolved as the nature of the policy issues changed over the years it became less obviously necessary, desirable or helpful to keep those often very different sets of policy areas in harness: that is the reason why it was decided to break those apart again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign affairs and trade yoking together at the same time has proved to be spectacularly successful in generating an economic culture to the extent that that was previously lacking on the foreign affairs side of the portfolio, and also giving a new kind of access and dynamism on the trade side of the portfolio in its capacity to work, particularly in overseas posts, in much closer association with the existing foreign affairs network.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was on 19 April that the Treasurer announced that the government was not going to proceed with this particular initiative. At the time of that announcement, he made it clear that there were a number of reasons for that. He cited Dr Vince Fitzgerald's report on national savings. Dr Fitzgerald suggested in that report that the policy would more likely lead to an increase in the average size or quality of dwellings, rather than an increase in the rate of home ownership per se.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason, and a quite forceful one, put forward by the Treasurer at that time was that circumstances and conditions in the housing industry had changed dramatically since that policy was announced. In fact, we have had a projection announced in recent days of the number of housing units to be built in Australia&mdash;a very high level of 170,000 for the forthcoming financial year&mdash;a figure which, when one compares it to recent housing starts, stands very much above the average of recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important factor cited by the Treasurer, and  one that we must keep in consideration, is that home ownership affordability is now at its highest level since 1984. One of the major reasons for that has been the reduction in housing interest rates&mdash;some half of what they were a couple of years ago. That has had an immediate impact on home ownership affordability. As I said, that affordability is now at its highest level in almost 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also noted&mdash;and this argument is also relevant in response to Senator Tambling's question&mdash;that there are other possible ways for super funds to flow into housing financing markets without the need for legislative arrangements. One such initiative was announced on 18 April this year by the National Mutual Group and the ACTU. Under this particular initiative, home loans will be made to members of superannuation funds at interest rates lower than those currently afforded by most other lenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's objective, in terms of the policy announced in the election, is still very much our objective&mdash;that is, to ensure that home ownership affordability can be achieved at high levels. We have achieved that because of the factors I have mentioned. The objective is still very much in our sight. The Treasurer announced on 19 April&mdash;and I can restate it now&mdash;that we have found other ways of ensuring that objective can be met.</PARA>

Is the minister also aware that QCOSS in its submission claimed that most community based organisations will be severely constrained in their capacity to respond to the inquiry issues paper and, where this has been done, it will be as a result of redirecting resources away from other areas of work?

The key elements of the work program focus on improving the coordination of industry development and market access activities by both the government and private sectors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that this matter of public importance should be raised today. It is very pertinent today because in an hour's time the government will be delivering a white paper. It will be one of 20 papers delivered over the past 10 years which have artificially tried to create jobs through artificial training schemes. We have had jobstart, jobtrain, jobskill, landcare, landcare environmental action programs, employment incentive schemes, community activity programs, skillshare, jobclub, task employees, skills upgrade, Aboriginal employment and training&mdash;a multitude, a plethora, of artificially created jobs. However, we still have not improved the prospects of the one million people who have been unemployed now for a number of years. Despite the government pouring $1.3 billion into unemployment, we still have a figure of 10 per cent unemployment, with one-third of unemployed Australians being under the age of 25. That is why I thought it appropriate to discover what small business can offer to the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is Wilson Tuckey, if the minister wants to know. The government has put down eight major economic statements and has produced 12 budgets. In November 1991 we had the One Nation package, a youth package in 1992, the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working for the Future</EMPHASIS>, the employment incentive scheme, government statements and a green paper on employment and unemployment. However, the only solution by the present government to this increasing problem is to boost spending on labour market programs and training schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year a sum of $1.3 billion was spent to artificially create 644,000 places. Today the government brings in another paper which, again artificially, will take 37,000 younger people off the dole. Then the unemployment scheme for the older age group will remove another 30,000 people from the dole. Adding up all the schemes, one sees that there are 325,000 people now on schemes that will last up to 26 weeks. However, the effect of those schemes is to remove 325,000 people from the unemployment list. In this way the  unemployment figures will be artificially disguised. The real figure that we have before us is at around 1,300,000 people who are not in real and permanent jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a small business sector involving 700,000 small businesses that employ 2.57 million people&mdash;51 per cent of the total private work force in Australia. Those businesses, if allowed to do so, can make a genuine attempt to sop up the unemployment rate. But last year and over the last three years some 60,055 small businesses hit the wall. That has been directly due to government policies and the fact that it has set its economic agenda to the detriment of small business.

Furthermore, in terms of sales tax policy, employers with payrolls of under $200,000 received some help. But those were micro interventions and are not worth two bob if the macro policy settings are wrong. In giving the figure of 60,055 for businesses that have gone to the wall since 1990, I would make the point that I see that as only the tip of the iceberg.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate with some bemusement because, from Senator Boswell's point of view, the debate would have been better placed tomorrow, after he had had the opportunity of seeing the substantial content of the white paper on employment, industry and regional development that will be laid down in this place at 4 o'clock today. I will certainly not pre-empt the details of that statement. I acknowledge Senator Boswell's interest in small business. In my view, he ought to be the shadow minister for small business for the coalition because, on my recollection, Mr Tuckey, who is the shadow minister, has issued only two or three press statements on small business in the whole 12 months he has had the portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have before me a transcript of the shadow minister's performance on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on Channel 10 on Sunday in which he was quite willing to talk about everything but small business, wallowing in his reputation of being a tough political operator. His comments on small business were appalling because they showed no substance and no policy concepts at all. He actually said to small business people, `Don't invest in your business.' I find that appalling, irrespective of which side of politics one is on. That the shadow minister would publicly go on national television and encourage small business not to invest is appalling. I am sure Senator Boswell would not say it, because his understanding of small business is much better than that of the shadow minister and most of the others in the opposition. I acknowledge that and always will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Crane will have to be patient until 4 o'clock this afternoon. Senator Boswell should not talk about lack of support from this government. We already have in place programs that have been very successful. I recommend that Senator Boswell get more detail about export access, a program designed to assist small and medium sized enterprises become successful exporters; a program in which we have already invested millions of dollars; a program that is organised and administered by the business organisations of Australia, and we provide the funds. That has been a very successful partnership. Chambers of commerce and manufacturing organisations have complimented the government on this program, saying that this is the best partnership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many firms have entered the export access program and around 85 to 90 per cent of them have some indication of an export order. I would like to read to Senator Boswell an unsolicited letter which I received today. The writer of this letter, the Managing Director of Kronos Products, is quite happy for me to read it out in the Senate. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am the owner of a small manufacturing business situated in Sydney. My late parents started the business in 1958 approximately two years after arriving from Athens Greece. I have been with the business for some 36 years, although being a tired 45 years old, I still like what I am doing, ie. manufacturing and exporting our chocolate macadamia products around the world. Almost all of our production goes overseas and this in turn helps to employ some 38 people in our small factory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We want small business to get into export because Senator Boswell knows as well as I do that we have to export more to get the deficit down. As Senator Boswell knows, the programs we have through NIES to get world best practice and better management processes into small firms has been an outstanding success. That is not just a federal government success story. It also includes state governments, Liberal and Labor, which have worked in cooperation with the federal government in establishing the NIES programs right around Australia. That has been a turning point in making our small and medium sized enterprises become internally more efficient and do better in their businesses in Australia. Where appropriate, export access also helps those who are eligible through producing products and services to become exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that face small business, and Senator Boswell has raised some of them, turn towards the macro-economic settings within Australia. What better things can we do for small business than to have the lowest inflation rate for 30 or 40 years, the lowest rate of industrial disputation for 30 or 40 years, and a growth rate of four per cent plus? From my visits to many small businesses in recent months, on my anecdotal observation the growth rate of those small businesses is much higher than for the rest of the private sector and may be running at much more than the average of four per cent for this period. Interest rates are at their lowest level for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all because we have our macro-economic settings right. We also have a program to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That underpins the fiscal outcome for the federal government, which we are committed to. All of those things add up to an environment where small business can invest properly and with confidence. </PARA>

Without hesitation, I compliment him on his interest. I do not always agree with the view he takes, but at least one can have a decent debate on a constructive basis with Senator Boswell. This is not possible with Wilson Tuckey or with most of the rest of the opposition because they are not up to score with what is happening in small business.

I notice that this last proposal is a probability, and a welcome one. It has taken a long time to drag the government to that acknowledgment, though. We also suggested reducing the uplift factor on provisional tax from eight per cent to six per cent; and, importantly, providing a rebate on sales tax on exports. Just these minimum tax reforms&mdash;with the exception of the phasing out of the payroll tax&mdash;would have had the effect of removing major disincentives in the tax system, disincentives to employing more workers and to the expansion of export activity. </PARA>

Surely it will not again ignore, like the 11 budgets before it, the special needs of small business. I guess that the political opportunity that is presented to us with this redefinition of the opposition's role is that perhaps there is an opportunity for us to find the common ground that I have heard Senator Boswell articulate this afternoon and use our legislative opportunities in this chamber to bring action for small business. </PARA>

There were 8,552 bankruptcies in 1989-90; 13,091 in 1990-91; 16,780 in 1991-92; 14,816 in 1992-93; and 7,351 to the end of the December quarter in 1993-94. In five years a total of 60,590 businesses have gone bankrupt, most of which were small businesses. This can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of this government and its economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up and put on the public record a couple of points. The first is the totally misleading claim by Senator Schacht. In fact, what he said with regard to Wilson Tuckey and the number of press releases he put out is a straight-out lie. The facts are that last year Wilson Tuckey put out 40 press releases and so far this year he has put out 14. Why any minister would want to come into this place and try to mislead the Senate in that manner is just beyond me. It does Senator Schacht no good, it does the government no good and it does those people who try to defend Senator Schacht no good. But it is really irrelevant to this debate. </PARA>

All of the corruption, fraud and so on in DEET's operation was raised here many years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue I want to deal with is one which I am absolutely certain will not be dealt with in this particular statement and that is the industrial relations legislation which came into operation just a few weeks ago. It is the single, biggest impediment to small business and employment. In fact, it has frightened the pants off small business. What this IR act has done in a technical sense is unionise the workplace, regardless of whether the employers or the employees want it. The no disadvantage test continues, and it is worse. In fact, it has removed any possibility of real, meaningful flexibility gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will not address that; they do not have the courage. Their masters will not allow them to address it. Government senators know darn well that that is a fact. While that no disadvantage test continues, we will not see true flexibility in the labour market and in the workplace. I can see Senator Carr taking down some notes. No doubt we will hear some erroneous nonsense in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to raise is the federal government's use of international conventions through the external affairs powers to override state legislation. The state legislation is working, but the government is hell-bent on destroying the industrial reforms that are occurring in the mining industry in Western Australia. Workers are willingly signing contract workplace agreements because they are better off and they want to share in the growth and productivity in Western Australia. One may ask this government why the growth is so much higher in Western Australia. Why has unemployment fallen so dramatically since Premier Court and his government took over, in contrast to 12 months before when Mrs Carmen Lawrence was the Premier and we had the worst unemployment figures in Australia? It is an interesting and instructive comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about small businesses being able to increase employment, it must address these issues. In fact, what it has done is directly hostile to the very ethos by which these business operators live. It defies their principles and the trusted mechanisms under which they do business. They are comfortable dealing with local identities. They deal with local bureaucracy. They tolerate&mdash;I emphasise `tolerate'&mdash;state departments, but they will not have a bar of the centralised approach of this government, simply because they do not trust it, and nor should they trust it. They do not trust what comes out of some of the hallowed halls of buildings in Melbourne. The people in them control industrial activities around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the inadequacies and restrictions of jobstart. No doubt this will be dealt with in the white paper. I want to put on the public record for those who do not know about it that the average income support on jobstart is 16 weeks. It ranges from 12 to 20 weeks. In dollar terms, the assistance ranges from $100 to $230. The people who are taken on are obliged to be kept on for 12 weeks after the support period ends. If they are not, for whatever reason, DEET has a responsibility&mdash;although it is questionable whether it is carrying out that responsibility, having regard to what we saw the other night&mdash;to remove that business from the list of businesses eligible for the scheme, regardless of the reason for non-continuation of the employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this has to do with the rigidity of the Industrial Relations Act and with the rigidity of the scheme. That is the reason why most small businesses reject it. One of the principle problems has to do with the termination provisions, which have been made far more onerous in this new act. There is no right to a sensible outcome between employers and employees. Almost every termination situation will end up before the arbitration commission. We have already seen that start to happen&mdash;and I am not referring to the heralded flexible employment agreements.

I suspect they are divided on matters such as this as well. It is a very sad indictment of the Liberal Party. Liberal Party members come in here and make noises about the concern&mdash;the crocodile tears concern&mdash;they have for various sectors of the economy, when the Liberal Party went to the last election with the policy of the GST, which of course would have done a great deal of damage to the small business sector in this economy. </PARA>

No matter where one looks&mdash;whether it is in training, management assistance, labour market programs or export facilitation&mdash;one sees a whole range of measures that the government is taking. It is giving considerable amounts of subsidy&mdash;in fact, quite significant, very generous levels of subsidy&mdash;to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen other measures, such as action under the Trade Practices Act, to prohibit unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions&mdash;again, to correct market failures. I am sure the Liberal Party would fully support those sorts of notions.

Six out of 10 Australians work in small business. All of this progress has been recognised, even by such staunch allies of the Liberal Party as Ian Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

I particularly took note of what Senator Schacht and Senator Carr said about all the wonderful things that this Labor government has done over the years to help small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a lot of friends in small business whom I have grown up with. I have been in small business myself. I know that from year to year the economy changes and all the rest of it. But the one single thing that people who have survived in small business say is, `For goodness sake, will you get the government off our back.' That is their plea. One of my good friends in Hobart who survived is in the contract building business. He started with a small business&mdash;it is still a reasonably small business. In bad times, he works longer hours and in better times he probably has a few more holidays. He adjusts to the changes in government policy and whatever. However, the thing that really upsets him most and gets to him most is that, while once upon a time he could go to work and do a bit himself, he now has to spend most of his time at home filling out forms for the government. If the government really wants to help&mdash;and it has talked about this in the past&mdash;why does it not simplify the controls that are applied to businesses? Why can it not implement a bit of the micro-economic reform that it has been talking about for so long?</PARA>

That is what the One Nation statement was&mdash;a fizzer. I hope for the sake of unemployed people in Australia that this one is not a fizzer. All these changes and all these training schemes have to be paid for with money&mdash;taxpayers' money. Where do we get the taxpayers' money from? A lot of it comes from small business, so the government will tax them more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard today about the tax burden placed on small business. At the last election, our goods and services tax policy was heavily criticised. I know that a lot of small businesses were frightened by the publicity that this government put forward.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business makes criticism of the government and its policies all the time. This criticism comes not only from small business&mdash;it also comes from its own ranks. We talked yesterday about youth unemployment and the fact that the bipartisan committee of which I was a member pointed out to the government that the way it was administrating the Department of Employment, Education and Training was wrong and that a lot of the work being done by it should be done by Social Security. That was 18 months ago. What has happened? The government did not even listen to what was said in that  report that we put forward. In recent days we have seen a television program that dealt with the way in which money has been ripped off from the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics reported that the government policies to help small business in relation to finance and management were inadequate. The same report recognised a crucial role played by small business in areas such as innovation and spelled out a number of deficiencies in existing support structures. Only in April of this year the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce released a study which called upon two key areas of the government's relationship with small business&mdash;Austrade and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation&mdash;to make their products and services more available to small business.

I just hope that this white paper will help unemployment. The fact is that small business needs to get government off its back.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures being announced today will cost $1.7 billion in their first full year.

The cost of failing to introduce the major efficiency and equity benefits to the labour market, industry and the regions that this package describes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that we have been able to accomplish these fundamental reforms consistent with our target of a deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of honourable senators, I will concentrate on only the most substantial of the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the government's strategy for getting the long-term unemployed back into work is the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job compact puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for six to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also introduce measures to identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with those who have been continuously unemployed for 12 months, these people will be given individual case management including remedial action in such areas as literacy, numeracy, language and vocational training and access to relevant labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that over half a million people will receive individual case management each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a radical program, a qualitative change in the way we approach labour market problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective is to make long-term unemployed people ready for a job, and break forever the pattern in which the long-term unemployed become steadily more dispirited and unqualified for employment, while employers become steadily less inclined to consider them employable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the purpose of the job compact is principally to see that a substantial proportion of the new jobs in the recovery go to long-term unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new training wage will be introduced to provide employers with extra incentives to hire long-term unemployed workers and invest in their training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage encourages employers to provide training places in two ways. The award wage will be discounted for accredited training and the employer will receive a wage subsidy from the government at a level above what it would be if no training were involved. This represents a substantial incentive for employers to play their part in the national effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An in-principle agreement on the training wage has been reached with a high-level ACTU committee which will be recommending its adoption to the ACTU executive. The government will also be consulting with employers on the details of the training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deliver case management and job placement services, the government will radically change the labour market by engaging community and private sector agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Job seekers will have a choice between these and the CES, with the competition between them regulated and encouraged by a new authority&mdash;the Employment Service Regulatory Agency (ESRA). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES will be revitalised to meet the greater responsibilities placed upon it by the job compact and other initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional resources, extra training of staff, external recruitment and improved information technology will be brought to the operations of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis will be on closer relations with employers, greater skills and efficient delivery through more sophisticated technology and coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, job boards and job cards in CES offices will be replaced with computerised vacancy systems featuring user-friendly technology to encourage self-help job searches. Mr President, as the white paper says, we are never going to return to a world where large numbers of full-time jobs are available for unskilled young workers. As the keys to a successful modern economy are skills, ideas and innovation, the keys to employment are education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be stressed too much&mdash;in the modern economy skills are our greatest competitive advantage. Whether it is in global enterprises or local small businesses, it is on the ability of our people to add value that our standard of living depends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on skills that every individual's standard of living increasingly depends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past decade, the number of young people completing year 12 or an initial post-school qualification has dramatically increased. However we are still below the average for the OECD and well short of the goal that all Australian governments have set&mdash;namely, 95 per cent of 19 year olds by 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper describes the government's program for building the skills of young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three principal elements of new government policy are: first, the government aims to encourage young people to stay in education and training by giving them appropriate financial support and more relevant courses run jointly by schools and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, we will be increasing the number and range of entry level training places for young people&mdash;by an estimated 50,000 by 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And thirdly, we will be introducing as a major policy change a youth training initiative for unemployed young people. The key to success is to provide help at an early stage in the unemployment cycle, which means with the least possible delay after leaving school. The principal features of the youth training initiative are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">intensive case management, with an initial assessment of skills and knowledge, for all unemployed people under the age of 18;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a doubling of the number of labour market and vocational training places for young people;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">assistance in finding a job; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">reformed income support arrangements to help keep young people in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the youth training initiative&mdash;in the clearest possible signal that every young Australian should be in education, training or employment&mdash;unemployment benefits&mdash;or the jobsearch allowance will be replaced by a youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, investing in skills of Australians, particularly young Australians, is the best investment we can make. This is recognised well beyond the realms of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is increasingly recognising it and increasingly indicating its desire to play a part. We are very well aware of industry's concerns about the relevance of current training and for this reason we are anxious to engage industry in both the design and delivery of courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future, Australian vocational training will be available through traineeships based in schools, TAFE, industry and labour market programs and will be available to adults as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A training wage which offers a much simpler alternative to the multiple industry-specific rates currently applying will be available to employers who provide entry-level training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the social safety net was a term first used in the 1940s by Ben Chifley. He thought of it as the net under a trapeze artist, `to break the fall towards destitution and sustain a man and his family while they help him climb the ladder of opportunity again'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principle of the safety net remains the same&mdash;and so does the basic necessity in a decent society to maintain it. But circumstances have changed and so must the way we design the net. The most fundamental difference is that no longer do families depend on the man alone to bring in the income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the present social security system continues to assume that only one member of a couple, in most cases the husband, will be actively looking for work while the other will be a dependant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ignores the increase in employment for women. It means that unemployed couples have not been encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years, the gap between income support for a married couple and income from lower paid jobs has also narrowed and the incentive to find work has been greatly diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another basic structural reform of our income support system, young unemployed couples without children will need to qualify for unemployment payments in their own right and the joint income test for unemployed couples will be abolished. The effect of this will be to encourage both partners to seek work. It also means that many low income working families will gain extra income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current social security income test, after a modest level of income, for every dollar of income earned, a dollar of income support is lost. From July next year the dollar-for-dollar taper will be replaced with a 70c in the dollar taper which will mean that people will always be better off from working because work will always increase their total income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another radical initiative, a parenting allowance will be introduced to provide an independent source of income for parents in low income families who care for dependent children under 16 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance will effectively provide a payment for one parent free of any obligation to seek work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a more generous income test for those who wish to combine parenting with paid work. By any measure, this is a major reform. The simplest measure is this&mdash;it will mean an extra $59 per week on average for nearly 120,000 low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance signals a new approach to income support based on the right of people to be paid as individuals, rather than as dependent partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this, and in the fact that it constitutes greater recognition of women's role in the work force and the growth in part-time and casual employment, the parenting allowance is consistent with the changes to income testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, if we do not take remedial action, the long-term unemployed and many young Australians at risk of joining their ranks will be relegated to the margins of our national life and miss out on the opportunities offered by the present recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said of many of the regions of Australia. The white paper presents a new Commonwealth approach to regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to make the most of all our national resources, including the skills and energy of our people, we need to ensure that the regions of Australia are given the opportunity to flourish&mdash;that they become partners in Australia's growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the white paper says, to neglect the regions is to neglect not only a great many Australians and all that they have to give this country, but to pass up the opportunity to build a stronger and more diverse economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three reports on regional development have been received by the Government in recent times&mdash;the Kelty taskforce report, the McKinsey report and the report of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal lessons to be learned are that the regions, though presently enjoying very different degrees of success, have in common an abundance of energy and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government takes the view, with Kelty and McKinsey, that the most effective approach for the Commonwealth is to provide strategic assistance of a kind that will help the regions to make the most of their human and physical resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More often than not, this will require them to integrate their local economies with the national and international economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper instances some remarkable achievements and some other places where major obstacles have yet to be overcome. The uneven performance of our regions in large part flows from an uneven quality of organisation and leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper details the way in which the Commonwealth Government will support the formation and functioning of regional groupings and provide assistance to regions so that they can develop and implement effective strategic plans, with an emphasis on international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be significantly modifying the tax treatment of infrastructure bonds and taking other steps to encourage private sector investment in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also provide funds for capital works where it can be demonstrated that their completion is vital to local economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the white paper nominates two regional development projects the Government will support which may be taken as models for other regions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goulburn Valley and the Sunraysia have developed plans for ecologically sustainable, highly productive, self-funding, irrigated agriculture which will repair the environment and greatly increase the contribution to GDP&mdash;the Sunraysia is expected to double output in the next two decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will provide funding for essential capital works projects and support for restructuring through the rural adjustment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the Prime Minister will be going to the Sunraysia on Friday to see first hand the proposed projects and meet with some of the region's leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted also that reforms to the labour market, education and training and social security contain provisions for programs which will be specifically tailored to regional needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, some 60 DEET area consultative committees will be created and they will seek to establish direct links with successful regional development organisations. The consultative committees will include employers, local and state government representatives and education and training providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as it is essential that we do not allow the long-term unemployed to become cut off from the mainstream of society, it is equally important that we take steps to see that regions of Australia are not left to drift out of the nation's economic and social life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms and initiatives necessarily depend on continuing economic growth. They depend on the ability of Australian enterprise to flourish and carve out a future in the world economy and especially the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the white paper contains a statement of the government's industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the thrust of government policy is towards globalisation, competitiveness and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing major success from measures already taken: a dramatic increase in exports, the rise of dynamic small and medium-sized businesses which have been born of the export culture developed in the last decade&mdash;`born global' in other words&mdash;the growth of manufactured exports to rank now with agriculture and mining as a proportion of GDP and the rapid growth in exports of sophisticated manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that our policies, including our tariff policy, are enabling Australia to be a competitive player in the regional and world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is equally no question that we have no choice but to continue the process of reform which alone will keep us in the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper contains a broad statement of the principles governing our industry policy and a number of specific measures consistent with those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of micro-economic reform will continue. A consistent goal of the next few years must be economic efficiency. The principles of `best practice', which many Australian companies have adopted, must be adopted by the nation itself. In this, as in all the measures described in this white paper, much depends on other tiers of government, on trade unions, business, communities, the people of Australia themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It demands a continuation of the great cultural shift which has occurred in the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sees its proper role as creating a competitive environment for industry and, by strategic intervention, helping to create competitive companies. As the paper says, our policy must be to harness the power of markets, while recognising that, left to themselves, markets will not always give us the best possible results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are measures described in this white paper to remove impediments to business efficiency, to facilitate exports, to encourage research and development, to make access to finance for small and medium-sized business easier, to remove regulation and to lower business costs&mdash;and among the latter, the white paper announces the suspension of the training guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One significant initiative will be the establishment of a body to improve coordination and delivery of government programs for business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's second report of 1994, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Refurbishment of Australian Federal Police College, Barton, ACT,</EMPHASIS> and the committee's third report of 1994, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Relocation of the Salisbury Explosive Ordnance testing facilities to Port Wakefield, SA</EMPHASIS>. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The first report which I have tabled deals with the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police College, Barton, ACT. The report recommends that the refurbishment should proceed, although there is a condition attached to this recommendation which I will explain later. The estimated cost of the proposed refurbishment is $10.5 million at July 1993 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report mentions that the existing college building, although partially extended and later renovated, is nearly 50 years old and the standard of living-in accommodation and training facilities reflects this. If the AFP is to have adequate facilities for the training of police officers and officers from other agencies, there is a definite requirement for better facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP examined a number of options, including the use of surplus schools and the integration of the college with a new AFP headquarters. Neither option proved practicable or financially realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the AFP proposes to upgrade the building to: comply with current regulations, fire safety and occupational health and safety; establish clearly defined functional zones and refine circulation and access routes within the complex; utilise existing courtyards more imaginatively; and upgrade the quality of work and residential areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is necessary due to the age and condition of the building and a requirement to provide a modern, integrated training establishment offering facilities consistent with contemporary standards and expectations. Therefore, the standard of accommodation proposed is consistent with a need to cater for the diversity of personnel attending training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the extent of the proposed upgrading of building services reflects the requirement to repair and maintain deficiencies in existing systems and to modernise them where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made recommendations concerning a number of design and consultative matters: on the question of fire safety, the committee recommends that the involvement of the ACT Fire Brigade should continue throughout the design and delivery of the completed project. The committee also recommends that an energy audit of the college should be carried out 12 months after the completion of the project. The committee recommends that the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled should be involved in the design of refurbishment work relating to access and other facilities for the disabled. The committee recommends that the AFP should formalise arrangements with child-care centres aimed at providing certainty about the availability of child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that the committee's recommendation that the work should proceed is conditional. This conditional approval stems from the impact of the law enforcement review, now completed, on the structure and functions of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The review had not been finalised at the time of the committee's consideration of the proposed work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very conscious of a case where a completed work previously examined by the committee was not required as a consequence of organisational changes occurring during construction. I am sure the parliament would not wish to see a repeat of this type of debacle. The committee, therefore, recommends that the project should proceed subject to impacts associated with the law enforcement review having no significant bearing on the scope of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled deals with the partial relocation of the Environmental Test Facility from its current location in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation complex at Salisbury to Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of honourable senators, I will try to explain what environmental stress testing is all about. It involves subjecting items of ordnance to a variety of tests which simulate their handling, transport and storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present this testing is carried out at Salisbury. The transportation of environmentally stressed ordnance from Salisbury to the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield poses risks to the public and Defence personnel which could be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee involves the construction of 12 test laboratory buildings and control and administrative buildings, four storage magazines and associated infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arriving at this recommendation, the committee concluded that environmental stress testing of explosive ordnance is essential to ensure the safety of Defence personnel required to transport it and ultimately operate the weapons systems. The committee also concluded that there is a need for the stress testing to be undertaken at a safer location, preferably in close proximity to a proofing range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence examined a number of possible locations and concluded that Port Wakefield is the best one and, having inspected the Proof and Experimental Establishment there, the committee agreed with this assessment. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed work can be justified on the basis of the specialised functions which need to be carried out by or in the various buildings proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought assurances from Defence about a number of safety and environmental issues. The committee was assured that the location and size of the proposed site provides adequate clearances and room for expansion; that preliminary engineering investigations have indicated that the site is suitable for constructing the buildings proposed; that there will be no significant deleterious environmental impacts from the proposed facility; and that there will be no additional firing and associated noise from the Proof and Experimental Establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress test facility to Port Wakefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the committee sought assurances about the long-term viability of the proposed facility in the light of possible future policy changes. Based on the evidence presented to it, the committee concluded that, in the event of policy changes occurring in the future which may place the responsibility for all or some environmental stress testing of ordnance on Australian manufacturers, need for and use of the proposed facilities will remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of revenue from testing ordnance, the committee concluded that provision of a new purpose built facility will provide considerable scope for Defence to undertake additional commercial work without the need for additional staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the construction of the new facilities will be the involvement of army engineers as the primary construction agency. The decision to use army engineers was made on the basis of the relatively remote site, the benefits to be gained from training and value for money. Army engineers are presently involved in the construction of RAAF Base Scherger, near Weipa, Queensland. From all accounts this is proving to be a very successful exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I should mention that the proposal has considerable local government support. The Proof and Experimental Establishment has been at Port Wakefield since 1928 and considerable goodwill exists between civilian and military authorities there. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

We have no idea what they are about, and we will not be supporting them either. I suspect from what Senator Coulter said that he is not even going to move them. He just wanted to make a bit of a song and dance about something around those sections, so he chose that method to have a say on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, thank you for your fairness in this matter. I wish that fairness was shared by others in this chamber. The concern that arises with these proposed amendments is that the imposition of them on people seems to be unfair and arduous and too great in many respects. When we proposed these amendments we were informed by the department that these general penalty clauses had been carried over from previous bounty acts. They may well go back 30 or 40 years. They are general clauses which are carried forward into virtually every bill which deals with bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, under those circumstances, to amend these clauses in relation to penalties in a way that would take them out of line with all the other bounty acts would be quite unfair and confusing to those administering the acts. That is the reason why we will not be proceeding with them. A review is required of all the bounty acts which include essentially identical clauses, not simply an amendment of the legislation before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for putting this before the Senate is to signal that these sorts of clauses appear in every piece of bounty legislation. They should be amended and reviewed in the light of modern practices with respect to penalties under bounty provisions. In view of the fact that other aspects of the administration of Customs are currently under review, I simply ask whether the minister is prepared to give an undertaking that these general clauses which appear in all the bounty acts will also be similarly reviewed. That would certainly satisfy our concern that these clauses, to a degree, are rather invasive in some respects and an unfair imposition in other respects. I seek here to signal to the Senate that these aspects of all bounty legislation need to be reviewed, and I seek an undertaking from the minister that such a review will take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After discussion earlier today, Senator Coulter said that he would not proceed with these amendments, but that he wanted to explain the purpose of them and get some comment from the government. I want to put on the record that clauses 50, 52, 53, 54 and 55 which were to be amended by the Australian Democrats are enforcement provisions relating to powers of authorised officers under the proposed bounty scheme to have persons answer questions and produce documents. The proposed amendments are not accepted; these are powers consistent with similar powers in all other bounty legislation. I do not consider it appropriate to change such powers unless it is done in a precise and complete manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can give the Democrats and the Senate a guarantee that officers of the Australian Customs Service, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, will conduct a review of all current bounty legislation to examine whether the common enforcement provisions should be consistent with those to be contained in the new customs legislation arising from the Australian Law Reform Commission report on customs and excise legislation. There is a reform process now under way in Customs which I announced only two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I announced in the decisions endorsed by Cabinet that one of the major changes to customs legislation will be to change the seizure powers of customs officers&mdash;other than at the barrier to prevent, for quarantine reasons, the importation of drugs and prohibited goods. Once inside the country, in areas dealing with the administration of tariffs, tariff concession orders and goods in the commercial area, the government will change the seizure power so that customs officers cannot seize commercial goods unless they receive a warrant from an appropriate judicial officer&mdash;a magistrate or a judge&mdash;beforehand. We believe this is probably one of the most significant changes to the operation of the Customs Act to bring it into line with the latter part of the twentieth century and the twenty-first century. So it is quite appropriate that the similar powers that operate in the bounty act be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view, and that of the government, is that these seizure powers which go with it, which were adopted way back at the beginning of the Federation, are no longer appropriate. I suspect they really come from the colonial period when Great Britain was dealing with old-style smuggling across the English Channel and seizure powers were made available to customs officers to stop that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that they are not powers appropriate for the Customs Service. Customs has to be industry sensitive and, in many of these areas, if there is a dispute it is a commercial dispute. I do not believe customs officers should have the power to seize goods in a commercial dispute. There may be a dispute, quite genuinely, over what amount of customs tariff is to be paid, or the amount of bounty to be paid or received. Often these cases are first dealt with in the courts. I do not think goods should be seized before a court or an appropriate tribunal has dealt with the matter and made a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State police forces in Australia work under the provision that they cannot enter premises and seize goods unless some sort of warrant for a search is granted by a magistrate. I think it is only appropriate that similar provisions should apply in this area. Therefore, I can certainly give an undertaking that we will review the operation of the bounty act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Australian Law Reform Commission review which took three years to look at the Customs Act. I suspect that in some areas I may have gone even further with reform than the commission suggested, although some of aspects come from the Conroy review itself. I draw attention to that report because, by the end of this year, I hope to bring into the parliament a major rewrite of the Customs Act. It will be a very comprehensive review of the act and of DEET. We will have to deal with a massive piece of legislation, but I think it is appropriate to do that so that Australian customs operations work with an act designed for the latter part of this century and the early part of the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect it will be a major workload for the Senate. It may even be referred to one of our interminable committees, but I do not object to that. As a result of the Midford experience, in particular, I think everybody agrees that these reviews and redraftings of the act are long overdue. We need to ensure that customs administration is appropriate for the twenty-first century in Australia and not for the seventeenth century in Great Britain. </PARA>

However, the coalition does not support that part of the message relating to Senate amendment No. 8.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed those provisions as a matter of principle.

Given these beliefs, it would be hypocritical of us to support such a provision which would effectively reiterate the current exclusion of certain farm assets from deductions under the current assets test.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, the views of the Democrats on the assets test as it relates to primary producers are well known. For many years, we have thought that primary producers are unfairly discriminated against by virtue of having to include their family farms in the assets test. We see the farm as a working asset. As such, we believe that it should be exempt from the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new formula the government is seeking to introduce takes the simplified view that the make-up of a primary producer's debt reflects the make-up of his or her assets. In other words, if one-fifth of a farmer's assets are exempt assets, it will be assumed that one-fifth of the farmer's debt relates to the exempt assets and, as such, will not be deductible from the farmer's assets under the assets test. Primarily, what we are talking about here is the farmer's house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the overwhelming majority of farmers have been on the land for many years and, as such, will have paid off that part of their original loan that related to the house. Further, most of the farms have very modest houses on them. Many farms would have been inherited and, therefore, have no debt against them. ABARE figures show that virtually all new farm debt incurred by farmers is for farm business purposes only&mdash;that is, for the purchase of land or working capital, for debt reconstruction or for the purchase of plant and livestock.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been made clear by both Senator Patterson and Senator Woodley, the coalition and the Democrats are seeking to omit part 7 from the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill because they see it, in essence, as being an attack on the rural community. That is simply not true. Indeed, the Social Security Act 1991 already contains very generous asset rules for primary producers. Part 7 of the bill, as Senator Patterson has effectively said, will only clarify the existing policy that has been in place for years. That policy requires that where an asset is exempt from the assets test&mdash;for example, a farmhouse on a farm&mdash;any debts related to the exempt asset should not be used to reduce the value of other assessable primary production assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the committee's attention, as did Senator Patterson, to the legal advice that has now been received from the Attorney-General's Department to the effect that the existing legislation authorises the department's current policy.

Going back a couple of years and four or five white paper statements, we had this March 1991 statement, which was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a competitive Australia </EMPHASIS> and which, like all the other statements that the government has made over its last 10 years, has virtually sunk without trace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 statement by the government modified the textile, clothing and footwear industry plan, which had been developed in 1986 to encourage the rationalisation of the TCF industry and the development of firms which are efficient and internationally competitive. Key elements of that plan included an industries development program, reforms to import arrangements and a program to assist employees displaced through restructuring. That 1986 plan was reviewed in 1990 and subsequently modified in March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modifying measures that were announced in that March  1991 statement are to be phased in by 1995 and will conclude in the year 2000. Those measures included the abolition of TCF quotas by 1993, the phase-down of tariffs to 25 per cent by the year 2000, some extra funding for what was called the industries development strategy, the introduction of an import credit scheme and, finally, the abolition of bounties on 1 July 1995 and their replacement with a five per cent tariff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today has a provision which seeks to implement that last measure by amending the principal act to provide for a five per cent tariff on textile yarns. The five per cent is to be applied to all imports and, as such, the Australian system of tariff preferences, which gives preferential tariff treatment to developing countries, will not apply in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose this measure&mdash;as I say, it is simply implementing a policy decision of three years ago&mdash;but I point out that this provision means an increase in the level of protection being afforded to the production of textile yarns. At the moment, the bounty, which is currently 15 per cent of value added but which is to go to zero as of 1 July, will be replaced with the five per cent tariff. So we are replacing a zero bounty payment by a five per cent tariff. That constitutes an increase in the protection accorded to the industry. It is, therefore, contrary to the policy trend of this government and the policy of the coalition over recent years to progressively reduce the level of tariff assistance in the process of making Australian industry more competitive and more productive. I would want the Senate to note that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we do not oppose the measure. It has the support of industry&mdash;it would be strange if it did not&mdash;and it is a central plank in the TCF plan to which industry has been working. What it draws attention to is the disastrous lack of progress there has been in this country in the last few years on the government's part so far as micro-economic reform is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look carefully at what has happened in the area of micro-economic reform we will find that, even by our own standards, it has proceeded as at a snail's pace. When we compare it with what has been happening in other countries, particularly our major trading partners against whom we have to compete if we are to have the development of our export markets and export growth and the correction of our chronic balance of payments problem, we can see that in order to fix those things reform of our infrastructure industries is absolutely essential. We have to do it better and faster than our competitors. Indeed, compared with the movement in those areas by our competitors, our progress can be described only as glacial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to any sustainable economic and employment growth is competitiveness and flexibility. It is somewhat ironic in that sense that we are debating this customs tariff bill on the day when the government has produced what the Prime Minister himself claims to be the most important statement by this government since it came to power in 1983. Yet he produces a statement today which in no way tackles this fundamental problem of the need for reform in our infrastructure industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation push is absolutely essential if we are to increase efficiency and productivity in many areas that are now owned by government business undertakings. That asset sales program is in an absolute shambles. It has failed to reach its targets since its inception six years ago. Some assets nominated for privatisation as long ago as six years, when the program started, are still on the books for sale. The Australian taxpayer, therefore, still controls an airline, a telephone company, a bank, an insurance company, a rail corporation, a car leasing service and a shipping line&mdash;all businesses which should be owned and run by the private sector if we expect to have any chance of getting the efficiencies and productivity growth that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commissioned report, known by the name of its author as the Hilmer report into competition policy, found that numerous areas in the public sector are in urgent need of reform&mdash;areas from law to electricity, and beyond. The public sector in Australia has largely escaped the need to compete. I certainly acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in some areas of public sector activity. I think the government's introduction of the financial management improvement programs and the like and some, but by no means all, of its rearrangements of the public sector have been positive, but a lot of them also have been negative. The fact remains that the public sector in Australia has largely escaped the need to compete. It is very interesting to see the movement by several of the state governments, under the control of Liberal or coalition party administrations, to implementing at rapid speed the many long overdue reforms in the public sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to say that Canberra has been very slow indeed to respond and follow the lead of the states. A very important case in point was the decision last year to abolish compensation to states that privatised their corporations. That decision sent all the wrong signals to the states on this very important area of reform. The number one priority for reform is the area of industrial relations and the need for flexibility. The government's moves in that area&mdash;quite contrary to what is needed&mdash;have been retrograde. The government has gone backwards and has overridden attempts by the states to provide flexibility and deregulation. That has been a major setback for competitive reform of the Australian labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long overdue need to make government regulations and legislation much more user-friendly and to make the law easier and clearer to understand and comply with. Instead, this government is seeking to increase the cost and complexity of the law. The recent changes to the fringe benefits tax are a classic example. The changes are enormously complex and very difficult to understand. The changes are very costly for firms to administer. The changes go absolutely in the wrong direction if we are looking seriously at increasing the competitiveness and the efficiency of Australian industry. The government keeps saying in its rhetoric that that is its aim, but when we match the rhetoric against performance we find a yawning gulf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressing need for microeconomic reform seems to have gone completely off the government's agenda for a variety of reasons. There are very different viewpoints within the government on this matter. The government Left is resisting these changes. This imposes a very heavy cost on the prospects and potential for growth&mdash;not just of our economy but, more importantly, of jobs in Australia. It is hypocritical in the extreme for the government to bring down white papers when it is not prepared to adopt measures that are necessary if we are seriously going to get Australia and Australians back to work. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose the measures in this bill. Senator MacDonald will deal with one or two of the other issues&mdash;in particular the excise on aviation fuel. There are several other very interesting measures that are not largely important, but they are of an interesting and desirable nature. I refer particularly to the removal of duty on reference materials which are, of course, materials with an accurately known composition and which are used as the standard against which other like materials and processes are measured or marked. At the moment those reference materials are dutiable, and this bill abolishes that duty. I will not go into the details of the other desirable moves because collectively and individually they are not of great moment. They are all largely of an administrative nature or, alternatively, provide the framework for policy measures which have been previously announced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 has four purposes. Its first purpose is to designate Eritrea as a developing country qualifying for concessional rates of duty under the Australian tariff preference system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill abolishes the import duty on so-called reference materials&mdash;materials that are used to establish standards for goods produced in Australia. Both of these measures are welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third measure is the validation of an increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. This measure raises a number of questions. First of all, it is an attempt to recoup from the industry the cost of the provision of safety measures at airports, but at this stage it only recoups a very small part of the cost. I understand that negotiations are still continuing with the industry. This measure recoups something like $4.5m, whereas the total cost of these services provided to airports at Commonwealth expense is of the order of $46 to $47m. No doubt some further adjustments will be made in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of concern that needs to be raised is that the increase in the rate of duty payable on aviation gasoline will fall far more heavily on communities in remote areas than on travellers between metropolitan centres. My concern is a little assuaged by the fact that we are looking forward to another bill to be introduced by the government called the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill which will be before the Senate shortly. That bill both increases and decreases in various measures the excise duty on aviation gasoline. The Australian Democrats will be watching very carefully what is being done by the government in a way to ensure that people in remote areas of Australia are not disadvantaged by these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth measure that this bill seeks to address is to replace the value added bounty on textile yarns from July 1995 with a 5 per cent tariff. I find it a little difficult to follow Senator Short's reasoning when he says that this represents an increase because the bounty is 15 per cent and, while it is certainly going to be abolished, it is being abolished in anticipation or parallel with this particular measure. It is only being abolished because it is being switched to a tariff. Therefore, the comparison between a zero bounty and a 5 per cent tariff is, with respect, not very factual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a reduction in protection from a 15 per cent bounty to a 5 per cent tariff. In itself, a 5 per cent tariff is not of great moment. It is really little more than a cost recovery measure for the Australian Customs Service. As most of the yarns that are being imported are used in textile manufacture in Australia, we do not oppose this low level of protection. We have had consultations with the industry on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take a strongly opposing view to that taken by Senator Short, namely, as to the unilateral reduction in protection of Australian goods. In this particular industry this has meant that currently two-thirds of the textile products sold in Australian shops are imported, and one-third only is produced in Australia. Going back only five or six years that proportion was reversed: we produced about two-thirds of all goods sold in that bracket in Australia and imported only one-third. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we would all agree in the long term we must reduce our involvement in highly labour intensive industries and concentrate on the higher quality end of the market. Therefore, I had great pleasure two or three weeks ago to visit the Fletcher Jones factory in Warrnambool. That factory has been struggling under the adjustments undertaken by the government in the past few years in the TCF industries. However, that factory is now concentrating on reviving its old tradition of highly customised, high quality products, also emphasising the fact that they are Australian products. I believe that Fletcher Jones has turned the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it is a good example of parts of the TCF industry which, after suffering considerable pain, have been able to adjust. The pain need not have been as deep and as sharp as it was. Hundreds of jobs were lost for a number of years and will be only partly recouped in Warrnambool. This has knocked the local community to such an extent that unemployment rates have been of the order of 16 to 18 per cent compared with 10 and 11 per cent in metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could have been avoided if the TCF plan had taken account of the need to change the shape of the industry, and that need still exists. In our budget proposals we have suggested that the government should allow a further $20 million of funding to the TCF Development Authority. It is quite clear that while some of the larger operators have been able to benefit from the restructuring plans and from the funds available under those plans, many small operators have not done so as yet. Yet the plan is reaching a point where most of the funds have been committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises an interesting principle. Here at least we have an industry that has had a plan. There are a number of other industry sectors which have been affected by the government's policy of opening up Australia unilaterally to world markets. Although other countries are protecting their industries through tariffs, quotas, subsidies, bounties and so on, and indeed by other non-tariff measures, the government has decided to throw open Australia and let those who can swim do so, and let the others sink. It is unfortunate that Australia has followed such an utterly stupid policy when other countries have taken a more strategic approach. Those countries have developed sectoral industry plans which rely on a careful assessment of the prospects of each industry, of the opportunities in domestic and overseas markets which, to my mind, and to the mind of any sensible person, would be an intelligent and strategic approach to the development of industry in Australia and in safeguarding jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is my first opportunity to make a brief comment on the white paper which contains a number of measures that one must applaud. I mention briefly the reduction in the threshold for research and development taxation deduction purposes from $50,000 to $30,000&mdash;a measure that was contained in the Australian Democrats' budget proposals. One must applaud a few such measures, such as the extension of the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry, although at only half the rate of reimbursement as applies to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the white paper has once again ignored the strategic opportunities offered by sectoral and geographic regional plans, and by and large has relied on `churning' the unemployed through training measures. Apart from that, it says that industry must help itself and the government will sit back and twiddle its thumbs and let them take such a course. However, we feel very strongly that the Australian government is responsible for creating the conditions which would enable our Australian industries to take full advantage of the growing world economy and to provide jobs for our workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe my remarks stand in stark contrast to the statements made by Senator Short. He seemed to be applauding the free market sink or swim policy which envisages the government having no responsibilities in this field, except to cut costs and provide no infrastructure and certainly little in the way of services to industry or to the community generally. Having had current consultation with the TCF industry, I would point out that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support my colleague Senator Short in addressing the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994. I confirm that the Liberal and National parties do not oppose the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The bill seeks to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to increase the rate of duty payable on aviation gasoline, avgas, and aviation kerosene, avtur, by 0.264c per litre. The rates of customs duty will be $0.22999 per litre for avgas and $0.00264 per litre for avtur. These amendments replicate the provisions of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, which I understand will be dealt with next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These increases were contained in the 1993-94 budget and form part of the CAA's agenda to recover part of the cost of aviation safety from the aviation industry. In its 1990-91 budget the government announced that it would phase in full cost recovery for aviation safety standard setting and enforcement services. This original proposal was strongly opposed by the aviation industry resulting in its review. In the 1992-93 budget, the Commonwealth announced a new approach&mdash;namely, that it would phase in 50 per cent of the CAA's safety standard setting and surveillance functions, with a cap of $22.8 million from 1 July 1993 to 1 July 1995. In early 1993 the CAA proposed a licence fee system of raising revenue to meet the first contribution by the industry to aviation safety, which again resulted in strong protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the CAA decided that the proposal needed further consideration. In the meantime, as an interim measure for 1993-94, some cost recovery was to be achieved by imposing an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur. There have been further negotiations, and 1994-95 will be another transitional year until final funding arrangements have been negotiated with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scenario for air safety is as follows: the estimated cost for air safety for 1994-95 is $60 million; the government will contribute $26.8 million; the industry will contribute $24 million; $1 million will be raised from the international airline fee; and $8.5 million will be raised from increased fees and charges. Naturally, there is some unhappiness in the industry over those increases. There is some concern that the major airlines think that they will be paying too much and that they will have to recoup the cost by increasing prices. They say that the need for airline safety is mainly in the general aviation industry. The general aviation industry says that the major domestic airlines carry the bulk of passengers and should therefore pay the bulk of the contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the technicalities and whatever the prices, clearly airline safety in Australia at present is undergoing something of a crisis in confidence. There are just too many anomalies and problems, particularly within the general aviation industry and the small commuter airline industry. Just last week a DC3 crashed into Botany Bay, thankfully with no loss of life. One wonders why that occurred and why that plane could not maintain its flight on one engine as it is supposed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time now, I have been trying to obtain from the Civil Aviation Authority information about the Monarch Air crash at Young in June of last year&mdash;a matter of some interest to me. Since then I have been trying to get information from the CAA. It is like trying to extract teeth. Every time I ask a question it seems to be the CAA's aim to make sure that I cannot get the information or that, if I do get some information, I get a little piece that means nothing in itself, so I have to come back later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one of those people that are terribly literate when it comes to aircraft, airlines and comments that mean something to people that do know something about aviation. I need a bit of extra explanation. But I am very concerned that I have never received much cooperation from the Civil Aviation Authority. I seem to have been given misinformation about that particular accident. It is very difficult to obtain the sort of information that I would have hoped might have been readily available to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular aircraft involved, VHNDU, was, as I think is fairly general knowledge, flying in an unsafe condition. The autopilot had been removed, which in itself is not a problem. However, the removal of the autopilot made certain other very necessary instruments inoperable, and that created a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA gave me a list of ramp checks done on this aircraft, VHNDU, and other aircraft; but the CAA did not do the obvious thing by telling me the results of those ramp checks. I had to come back yet again with a series of questions on notice, the last series of which were issued on 24 March and have not yet been answered. Again, the minister is in breach of Senate regulations by not answering in 30 days, but this is just typical of the difficulties that have been put in my way of obtaining information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should have thought that, when the CAA indicated that reports had been issued on these ramp checks, it might have told me what was in those reports but it has not. I have had to go back with further questions on notice and ask the CAA, `What was said in the report of the ramp check that was done on this aircraft not very many days before the accident?' I have had a great deal of difficulty getting that information, and I think I can now understand why. A lot was made clear in a report on the ABC a couple of Sunday lunchtimes ago on a program which I think was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background briefing</EMPHASIS> which contained a series of interviews with a number of people involved in that air crash at Young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments are on the public record. Everyone could have heard them on the ABC program. Because this bill has been called on in advance, I have not got together the information in the style that I wanted. However, I want to quote some things that were said on that program about Monarch Air and that particular aircraft. A Mr Gary Hearn, who was the chief pilot at Southern Airlines, a small operator which flew into Forbes and another town when Monarch took over that airline in 1992, is quoted on this program as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was probably the most unsafe organisation we've ever had anything to do with. They just had no respect for the rules.

<PARA>it does not quite make sense but that is the transcript&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I guess the pilots were outside their hours, and they weren't necessarily current all the time either.</PARA>
<PARA>This transcript of that program continues. One of the witnesses who was interviewed on that program goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the regulations, NDU should not have been flying without a working HSI. The pilots and engineers who worked on the plane should have reported the fault and grounded the aircraft. But when Nigel Clarke, a licensed engineer, was called in by Monarch to inspect the plane 12 days before the crash, the HSI was missing.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Mr Nigel Clarke is interviewed and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the HSI, the horizontal situation indicator, was not operating, me as a maintenance person would instantly, knowing that was a minimum instrument required for flight, would ground the aircraft and would have to get the instrument operating again.</PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what did you do when you found that those instruments were gone?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Clarke again said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I just .. this was in the period of me doing the inspection, I notified the person who was directly responsible for controlling the inspection, and that I was unable to check the remote compass system due to the instrument being missing, and that I should be called back immediately that the instrument was refitted, so I could do a functional check to ensure that the system was operating.</PARA>
<PARA>When he did come back to look at it, the aircraft was already flying without his permission. Mr Gary Hearn, a pilot who actually flew that plane, VHNDU, for Monarch in 1992, said that at the time he flew it the autopilot and the HSI were working but that there were still maintenance problems. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I flew NDU, as I said, went out west one Friday night to Young and Cootamundra, and had to find some approaches in both these places, and the pilot lights failed actually on the return to Sydney. I lost the oil out of the engine, flying from Forbes to Sydney, and had to land at Bathurst. The oil was just, basically, coming out of the side of the cowl, and the Chieftain had maintained oil pressure down to about the last two litres of oil, so the oil pressure still maintained in the green. However, we landed at Bathurst and the engineer later said that it wouldn't have got across the Blue Mountains.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote these excerpts only to indicate that that airline had a history of unsafe operations that the CAA knew about. It is of very grave concern, I am sure, to all members of parliament and to the public generally that this was allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more evidence in that radio interview that one of the inspectors for the CAA actually recommended that Monarch's licence should be withdrawn. That recommendation was not taken up. Had it been withdrawn, a number of people might be living today who are not. So it is a very serious matter. Some of the statements on this radio program and some of the information I have received, I suspect, may be open to challenge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 is quite interesting. When one gets the explanatory memorandum one sees that page 2 states that, amongst other things, the bill increases the rate of duty on aviation fuels. That is quite extraordinary, because this bill is marked on the first page on the bottom right corner with a `T'. I hazard a guess that most honourable senators would not understand what that `T' denotes. The letter `T' in the bottom right hand corner of the first page of the bill denotes that it is a bill dealing with taxation. That is a notation put there by the chief parliamentary counsel&mdash;the people who draft the bill&mdash;to denote that this bill deals with taxation. For the greater part, this bill does deal with taxation. But where this bill increases the rate of duty on aviation fuels it does more than deal with taxation; in fact, it imposes taxation, because it imposes an extra burden on those who have to pay the tax on aviation fuels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went across to the clerk assistant and I said, `This bill originated in the House, didn't it?' The clerk assistant, without thinking, said, `Yes'. Then he came over to me and said, `Look, I'm dreadfully sorry, I made a mistake.' The clerks rarely make mistakes, but he said, `I just assumed that it did because it increased taxation'. In fact, this bill is a Senate bill introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, who is currently occupying the position of minister at the table. I know Senator Sherry is an extraordinary individual, but whether he has the power to do things which no other minister in the Senate has the power to do is an interesting point. Section 53 of the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate.</PARA>

It has to be somebody else, but I would like to know who.

Maybe that is what happened. Maybe it just forgot. </PARA>

It is very clear that it is a measure imposing taxation. Just because the government spends the money it takes, it does not mean that it is not taking the money in the first place. It does not mean that the government has not stuffed up yet again on this bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I close, I would like to invite Senator Sherry to give the chamber an explanation of how the government got it wrong again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains a number of measures, but I want to concentrate my remarks on just two areas: firstly, the amendments relating to the Quarantine Act; and, secondly, the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act. Broadly speaking, amendments in this bill to the Quarantine Act will allow Australia's Quarantine and Inspection Service to more closely focus its attention on imports of highest risk. This will be done by providing legislative backing for quality assurance compliance agreements between the director of quarantine and those in industry to ensure that quarantine protection is maintained for all low to medium risk imports. The bill will also provide backing for the electronic entry and processing of imports for quarantine purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been a cooperative effort on the part of industry, customs and the quarantine service in the development of systems for the electronic entry of goods and, indeed, these systems are currently being put in place around the country. The government has given us an assurance that there is to be no risk to the level of quarantine security brought about by these amendments, and I certainly welcome that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) said that the act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Advisory Council more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the current requirement for the council to conform to the relevant division of the Audit Act 1901 is to be repealed. Instead the chair of the council will be  required to submit an annual report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and that report will be tabled in the parliament. The report will contain not only a report on the advisory council but also on the operation of the rural adjustment scheme itself. As honourable senators will know, the Rural Adjustment Advisory Council is responsible for monitoring the operation of the rural adjustment scheme and for making recommendations to the government as to the future direction of the scheme and the amount of funding that is seen as appropriate for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 months in my role as a senator, and for a good many years prior to that, I spent a lot of time travelling around country areas of Australia&mdash;mainly in my home state of Queensland, but also in some of the hardest hit regions of South Australia and Victoria. The message I continue to get from these people living in rural Australia is that the so-called process of adjustment is a very painful one for all involved. It seems to me that the very word `adjustment' is yet another highly clinical term that comes from behind a desk in Canberra. It in no way conveys the despair of many of our farmers, or the utter hopelessness that they sometimes feel in going through the process of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian farmers have a tradition of passing farms from one generation to another. In some cases the ownership of a farm is passed down through five or even six generations. During all those years those farms were viable, but the farmers arrive in the 1990s to be told that their farms are no longer so. Given this, one can only try to imagine the horror of a family realising that its farm may no longer be viable and that it may have to be handed over to the banks to be disposed of as quickly as possible&mdash;in other words, for that family to be adjusted out of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the release of a number of positive economic indicators recently, and reports of growing business confidence, the plight of those in rural Australia seems to be dropping off the agenda. As such, I am very pleased that I am to be involved with the inquiry to be conducted by the Senate  Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. This inquiry will look specifically at the adequacy of the rural adjustment scheme and at the extent of rural debt. I pay tribute to Senator Ron Boswell, who raised this reference in the first instance with me. We certainly supported the reference to the committee. Just as important, in my opinion, is that the inquiry will also examine the social, economic and ecological consequences of that rural debt, and recommend mechanisms for managing rural reconstruction. I am pleased that this inquiry will help to put the crisis of rural debt back on the public agenda where it most certainly deserves to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, while the rains earlier this year were great news for some of our primary producers they certainly do not mean the end of their troubles. Average farm debts for grain growers in Queensland are in excess of $250,000 per farm; for graziers, well over $200,000; and, for cane growers, around $150,000. Statistics collected by rural counsellors show that across South Australia average farm debt is nearly a quarter of a million dollars. In some parts, the debt was as high as $335,000. Indeed, more than a third of that state's farmers are currently living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many aspects to the farm debt crisis. The human side of it is the one that I am particularly conscious of and concerned about. There is clearly a great need for governments, banks, rural counsellors and farmers organisations to work together to find solutions to the farm debt crisis. There are some valuable suggestions coming from farmers groups. I urge the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory  Council to look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the Queensland Grain Growers' proposal for a rural adjustment unit to be set up&mdash;a unit which would draw together in one place rural organisations; rural counsellors; community organisations such as Lifeline; state, federal, and local governments; and especially, and above all else, banking and other financial institutions, so that they can sit down and deal individually, case by case, with properties under the threat of foreclosure. I will certainly be looking for the council's report later this year to provide some concrete suggestions as to how this debt crisis for family farmers can be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This is an omnibus bill which will amend several pieces of primary industry legislation, including the Quarantine Act 1908, three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. The Commonwealth's quarantine service, in regard to fee for service, has suffered many problems. One problem is that many of the customers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service cannot get an accurate picture of how much the quarantine procedures, which can last up to about 10 years, are likely to cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have had a case of the Commonwealth encouraging goat owners to import goats and to place them in quarantine. The original price was quoted as $50 a year per goat with a quarantine period of five years. This blew out to $410 per goat and eight years in quarantine. Of course, the number of goats increased each year through breeding. In 1991 the government threatened to sell some of the goats to pay the bills, but the coalition combined with the Democrats to stop this and we advised all future users of the quarantine service to enter into contracts with the Commonwealth to ensure that their costs were known before putting animals into quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to this legislation and the amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. This act will be amended to provide for the late payment of fees in respect of quarantine service, booking fees and deposits for services provided at quarantine stations, the withholding of quarantine services until fees and any deposits have been paid, the electronic processing of imports for quarantine purposes, the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with other persons for the purpose of carrying out quarantine functions, and notice to be given of imports. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these amendments were recommended by the Auditor-General's report No. 35 1991-92 on quarantine fees and charges. That report regarding the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service made three recommendations on fees and charges, and required legislation for them to be implemented. These recommendations were the withholding of services for non-payment of fees; greater use of monetary penalties; and the introduction of a booking fee deposit system for quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts will be amended to extend the time available to the states to pass complementary legislation from July 1994 to July 1996. I am sure this has important implications for the states and  territories. Amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 remove gender specific terminology and enable the appointment of an acting commissioner or acting assistant commissioner of the hydro-electric authority for more than 12 months. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly indicate the coalition's support for this legislation, but I highlight that what is missing from the legislation can perhaps be best typified by an example of a Queensland farming couple who went bankrupt recently and received a re-establishment grant from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992 which they used to purchase a home to live in. Legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department suggests that this home could be available to creditors, which is against the spirit of the re-establishment grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 22 of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 appears to give protection to such payments. However, the government failed in 1990 and 1992 to also amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966, as it had done with all previous rural adjustment bills in which similar payments were legislated. This case came to light several months ago, but the government has been slow to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that it was only after the government heard that we were going to move an amendment that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), in collaboration with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), gave a commitment to move an amendment to the law and justice legislation which will be debated here this week. But I am pleased at this stage&mdash;and I am sure that my colleague Senator Brownhill will also be pleased&mdash;to address many issues relating to this legislation. </PARA>

Senator Tambling has outlined its full implications, and I imagine that it will go through reasonably quickly tonight. I will not hold it up for very long. However, given my interest in one or two areas to which this bill refers, I would like to make a few comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to changes to the Quarantine Act 1908, this is just another example of things not being right, accounting-wise, within AQIS. That is of concern to all of us, and it has been for quite some time. Senators may well remember that a number of years ago&mdash;Senator Tambling has already referred to this&mdash;a situation arose where a fee for service was varied significantly and the quarantine service tried to sell some of the animals it held in quarantine to offset costs owed to it by the importer of the animals. The coalition, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats, stopped the action, but it highlighted at the time&mdash;and it reminds us now&mdash;just how sloppy AQIS is and has been in terms of accounting and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments outlined in this bill will provide for late payments, booking fees and deposits, and other processing and accounting charges. Many were recommended in the Auditor-General's report No. 35, which contained a number of criticisms of AQIS and its financial management. Other aspects of the inefficiencies of AQIS were highlighted by Senator O'Chee and me last year at the estimates and elsewhere. Much of what we argued involved sloppy accounting and a poor cost recovery ethos. This legislation covers some of the many reforms that AQIS desperately needs to make it efficient and accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act will give more time for the states to pass complementary legislation necessary for the ag and vet code to become operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the Rural Adjustment Act merely relate to the annual reporting arrangements. Much needs to be done to the rural assistance scheme, which this government continually seems to put in the too-hard basket. It is no surprise, therefore, that the reference moved by Senator Boswell, the National Party leader in this place, to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs to examine RAS has been taken up. Our complaints about RAS&mdash;how it could work, how it should work, but what it does not deliver&mdash;are well founded. The inquiry, which has now called for submissions, will be interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that, when the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has finished its examination, more appropriate changes will be recommended that will allow RAS to operate as it was intended. I have no desire to delay the Senate any longer in debate on this bill, but I would urge that with both the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the rural adjustment scheme the government should take on board the many serious complaints levelled by the rural community about these two government agencies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument presented during that public inquiry was that the legislation should not be tampered with and should not be delayed. Let us get this straight: the legislation to establish the National Registration Authority should not to be delayed because it was very important to get everything under way and all hooked into gear so that the states could comply and all be ready at the same time. Now we have legislation delaying it not for a couple of weeks, not for a couple of months, but for a couple of years. I believe we on that committee were pressured not to suggest any substantial amendments to the legislation because the states were ready to go along with it: a deal had been done, it was all nicely packaged and ready to go, so we should not get in its way. Five minutes later we come to this place and find legislation requiring us to delay it. When I spoke at that inquiry and when I later assembled a dissenting report, that was the substance of my dissension. I feel justified now in having dissented. </PARA>

<PARA>I take this opportunity to congratulate the two commissioners involved, Gary Banks and Cliff Walsh, on what is an excellent report that ought to be compulsory reading for all those interested in regional development in Australia. The need for the government to remove the impediments to regional adjustment identified by the Industry Commission in this report is very urgent because of the situation in many of Australia's regions. The commission says in its overview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most striking feature of many regions is their high levels of unemployment, especially in the non-metropolitan regions. . . . Unemployment in recent years has brought significant regional, social and economic costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this report is directed towards. But after having had a look today at the white paper, which does address regional issues, it would appear that the Industry Commission report itself has been largely ignored by the government. On the face of it, what the government has done in relation to regional issues would appear welcome but, in terms of the fundamental problems identified by the Industry Commission, they are largely ignored. The Industry Commission report itself is largely ignored. Throughout the white paper all we see are references to Mr Kelty and his particular review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major impediment identified by the Industry Commission in its assessment of the impediments is industrial relations. It is quite clear from reading the report that the commission certainly does not accept that what the government has done on industrial relations goes anywhere near far enough in addressing the major impediment which our industrial relations system is to employment in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in its white paper, has fluffed the opportunity in relation to this matter. It has done nothing further on industrial relations. It is quite clear that the government needs to go much further to enhance employment opportunities in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission also identified regulation and taxation of services as a very major impediment. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission supports the view that intermediate goods used in the production process&mdash;such as fuel used for road transport purposes&mdash;should not be subject to taxation purely for the purpose of raising general revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>That, again, has been totally ignored in the white paper. We see no reference whatsoever to that very major impediment to employment in the regions. In fact, this government's most recent actions involve increasing the costs of these services in regional Australia. Yet another increase in fuel costs is coming in on 1 August, something which the government hopes Australians have forgotten but which they will know all about on 1 August. This will be a further impediment to employment opportunities in regional Australia and is a matter for considerable regret. Yet again it is an instance of this government not paying attention to this excellent report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also identifies intergovernmental financial relations as a major impediment to employment opportunities in the regions. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission recommends that the Commonwealth initiate a program of assessing options aimed at transferring additional revenue-raising capacity to the States . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the white paper says absolutely nothing about that issue. There is no agenda for the government on this issue. It has again completely ignored this major impediment to regional development. The report also examines the government's adjustment assistance schemes. In light of the comments made on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> about DEET, it is ironic to note that the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the proliferation of labour market schemes and the substantial expenditure involved, the Commission recommends that there be an independent public review of their role and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> assessment of the debacle in DEET, we have seen how effective those schemes are. It is ironic that the commission made these comments back in December last year. This is an excellent report which I commend to the government. The government has largely done nothing about it in the white paper. I hope that, both in the budget and in future government action, the report is considered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>We are currently in the fourth year of the decade of landcare. As the Senate knows, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has started an inquiry into landcare. Submissions we have received and evidence that we have taken certainly indicate a high level of awareness of what landcare is all about and what the organisation aims to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare Australia is a non-profit company established in October 1989 as part of the strategy of the decade of landcare. It receives administrative funding of about $700,000 from the federal government. Otherwise, it seeks outside assistance. The report clearly sets out the company's objectives. Before I talk about the company's objectives, we should pay a tribute to Rick Farley from the NFF and Philip Toyne from the ACF for the work that they did in increasing awareness, through both the farming communities and the ACF, so that these can work together in the decade of landcare. I think that has been one of the big achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence that they gave us earlier this week, which was public evidence, would make good reading for all those people who are interested in looking after our heritage, which is basically the land. If we do not look after it, we will not have our productive resources for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives to develop a landcare ethic amongst all Australians are very admirable and very important to encourage and stimulate public awareness of the importance of landcare and the adoption of landcare principles, to encourage and stimulate public participation in landcare activities, to encourage and facilitate education on landcare principles in schools and the community generally, and to educate and disseminate all forms of information through all media to promote the objects of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is important to note while we are talking about landcare tonight. Quite a few people wish to speak about it. I know Senator Sandy Macdonald, my colleague from New South Wales, wishes to speak about it, and I imagine Senator Crane and others do as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare's object is also to develop activities to attract corporate and community funding to appropriate projects consistent with the objects of the company and to distribute funds to appropriate projects consistent with the objects of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at subsequent pages of the report we see clear evidence that it is meeting those objectives. Sponsorship, for example, has grown from $461 million in 1991-92 to $838 million in 1992-93. Awareness campaigns are having an impact. Surveys suggest that nearly 50 per cent of all Australians&mdash;35 per cent in the city and 60 per cent in the country&mdash;know what landcare is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most outstanding thing about the awareness campaigns undertaken by Landcare Australia is that they are showing that looking after our land&mdash;air, water and soil&mdash;is the responsibility of everyone. Promotions undertaken include involvement of companies like Uncle Toby's, raffles involving the Ford Motor Company, a school video competition and a new water quality 50c coin launch. These are the sorts of activities we need in order to educate Australians, particularly in cities, about the importance of caring for our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare activities now come in many various formal and informal programs. In New South Wales, landcare groups have grown from 340 in 1992 to over 500 by July 1993. That sort of expansion is happening across Australia. I pay tribute to Jim McDonald from my area on the Liverpool plains who has done such a fantastic job for the landcare movement in the area. But funds are not keeping up with demand and there is a great risk that the enthusiasm that has been created by all this promotion will fade and pass if funds are not forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs yesterday showed that while the federal government uses a figure of $105 million when referring to environment/landcare type works, the more accurate figure is under $5 million. That is not much to spread across all the worthwhile projects in Australia. When we consider that was the initial amount spent on establishing the gardens around Parliament House, we realise just how inadequate that amount must be for the whole of Australia. I commend the Landcare Australia annual report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make three points with regard to the annual report of Landcare Australia. Firstly, I congratulate the Landcare organisation and its thousands of supporters around our country. In my home state of Tasmania there are 100 groups and they are divided equally between the rural and urban areas. The problem of soil degradation is a real problem. Indeed, as an environmental issue, it is far greater than issues such as whether a certain river ought to be dammed or the harvesting of forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare has raised the consciousness of Australians about our soil and its importance to economic and national survival. One of the great strengths of Landcare is its non-political nature and its desire to get the job done. However, this non-political role of Landcare is being brought into question, and I will deal with that later. The sponsorship from the private sector of approximately $3.5 million is a tremendous result and a wonderful example of government, companies and the community working together to achieve a genuine goal for our country&mdash;the preservation of our valuable soils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to make is to sound a warning to the Landcare organisation not to become too bureaucratic. Its strength has been the fact that it has been based on local groups with local input, and local state assessment bodies. I trust this will continue to be the basis on which Landcare operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final point&mdash;indeed, the most serious point&mdash;I wish to raise is the prostitution of this wonderful scheme for cheap political purposes. It is no surprise that the person administering the scheme was the former minister, Ros Kelly, who will be eulogised for sports rorts. Similarly, the landcare program was prostituted by the federal government. It is sad that a wholesome project such as landcare can be sullied by the filthy political handling of the Labor Party. Indeed, before the last federal election, I have reason to believe that the minister overrode the selection decisions in one state to give preference to schemes in marginal Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election, the blatant politicking has continued. I refer to the East Tamar landcare group in my own state of Tasmania. It submitted a proposal and was duly accepted by the Tasmanian selection panel and approved by Canberra. The private landowner was therefore given the green light, so to speak, and spent $4,500 of private funds on tree planting and assisting in soil preservation. Those funds, spent out of an overdraft account, were employed on the reasonable expectation that reimbursement would soon be forthcoming to the tune of approximately $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landcare group waited for its funds and they were not received. After many weeks the person concerned, a Mr Ian Sauer, rang Canberra to be told the moneys had been sent to Silvia Smith, the very short-term member for Bass, some six weeks previously. On inquiring why the money was sent to Mrs Smith, Mr Sauer was advised that a ministerial directive had been given that, in certain cases, the cheques ought to be forwarded to the federal Labor member for presentation. Mr Sauer's cheque had been forwarded six weeks earlier to Silvia Smith's office. For the purposes of political grandstanding, the Labor Party was withholding moneys rightfully the property of other people. Mrs Smith was unavailable to make the presentation immediately because she was swanning around overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The withholding of funds causes embarrassment for landowners because their cash flow is unduly affected and leads to unnecessary interest bills being paid on overdrafts. Unfortunately, the East Tamar group was not an isolated example. The federal member for Bass, Mrs Smith, and the federal member for Lyons, Mr Adams, have both engaged in this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I support landcare. I salute it as a project worthy of support and continued funding because of its real benefit to our environment and the educative role it plays. It is regrettable that the Labor Party cannot leave its filthy fingers off the program. As we read today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, it appears that prostitution is part of the way of life for the Australian Labor Party. That is for them, but it is a tragedy when programs such as landcare fall victim to Labor's tactics. </PARA>

It is also worth noting that his son David for some years was the Landcare officer at Inverell&mdash;which is not too far away from us&mdash;and he did a very good job there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are nearly half way through the inaugural decade of landcare that Landcare Australia was set up to promote. Its aim was sustainable land use. The core aim of Landcare is the development of a partnership between governments&mdash;both the Commonwealth and the states&mdash;and the community, which includes particularly the National Farmers Federation. The aim is to address land degradation across this wide brown land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare's other important role is to work with the corporate sector to raise funding to support landcare group activity and conduct awareness campaigns. A large number of companies now provide sponsorship for landcare initiatives across Australia through the encouragement of Landcare Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, by accepting landcare groups' projects as its own, Landcare Australia is able to offer tax deductions for any donations of money or property. Landcare Australia relies heavily on the landcare network for support in carrying out its awareness and fundraising functions, particularly for national events such as landcare month, which was held in March this year, and landcare day, which is held early in November every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare is maintained in its effort by an extensive regional and community group network across Australia. Those of us in rural and regional Australia are all very conscious of the good work that Landcare does. Landcare Australia is to be congratulated on its ability to raise public awareness of its work. Under the heading `national awareness' the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre on the company's behalf, shows that between July 1991 and November 1992, the awareness of landcare doubled from 22% to 44% on a national basis, and increased threefold from 10% to 34% in capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite a remarkable increase in public awareness, and Landcare Australia can take a lot of the credit for that increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make special mention on this occasion of the Liverpool plains land management committee, which has accepted the role of coordinating the planning, research, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of the rich Liverpool plains in New South Wales. It is an area of immense economic and farming significance and produces in excess of $120 million of export income a year. </PARA>

Tonight I want to deal with a particular individual named in the report, Mr Elton Butcher, who received the Order of Australia for his services for land conservation. He retired on 30 June 1993 after many years as the chairman of the national soil conservation committee in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Elton Butcher in the late 1960s or 1970s. As a very young person I got involved in agropolitics. He had an outstanding career serving agriculture and the meat industry&mdash;I see Senator McMullan smiling, maybe he had the joys of knowing Elton Butcher. Many people claim to be the fathers of the Landcare program, but back in the late 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s, Elton Butcher went out and argued the case for land conservation and proper development plans at a time when it was not fashionable to do it&mdash;at a time when almost everybody said that, once people walk through the gates of the land or the farm or onto the reserve, it was sacred country and nobody had any rights to preserve that particular resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elton Butcher was joined by a few other people&mdash;Harry Whittington, the promoter of interceptor banks; Graham Robertson, who was the commissioner for soil conservation for many years in Western Australia; Des O'Connell; Bill Meier; and others&mdash;who created an awareness of the importance of soil conservation, land management, on-farm and forest plantations and a whole range of other activities including the preservation of natural vegetation. They put forward propositions that in those days were not fashionable such as mechanisms to assist fencing out native vegetation, fencing out areas on private land that have significance for water conservation and a whole range of other things. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that people who are involved in this get recognition for their services. I congratulate Elton Butcher for being recognised and for receiving the Order of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember, soon after he jointed the Western Australian national soil conservation committee, seeing a car drive in when I was down on my own property. He had heard that I was planting trees through seeds. At that time, that was unique and considered to be one of those things that would not work and now that has all been proved wrong. Elton Butcher heard about this and had driven some 500 miles from his property at Pithara just to have a look at it being done in practice and to get a hands-on assessment of what was being done. That really epitomises the man and how he went about things. If he heard about an idea he wanted to see it and how it worked and make an assessment. He came back on a number of occasions to monitor progress through that particular period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The recommendations in the Industry Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impediments to regional industry adjustment</EMPHASIS> are a mixed bag. First of all, I will address the points which I think are detrimental to regional development in Australia. The report argues the need for greater regional flexibility in unit labour costs and greater flexibility in wages and work practices based on less restrictive conditions on workplace agreements. The report argues that this does not mean regional wage cuts. What does it do if it does not do that precisely? It clearly seems to imply that people in regional areas should earn less than people in metropolitan areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter that is greatly objected to is where the closure or downgrading of social infrastructure facilities within regions is contemplated. The report says, `Communities should be given the option of contributing directly to maintain facilities.' So not only should people in regions earn less money, but also they should pay more for the community facilities that people in metropolitan areas enjoy at a lower cost or free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report says that, where infrastructure provisions and delivery costs vary between locations, that should be reflected in different prices rather than masked by uniform prices. In other words, since it will cost more to provide services in regions, these costs should be reflected in the prices that people in regional communities pay. If it costs $13,000 to have a telephone connected&mdash;and in some remote areas that would be the case&mdash;the report suggests that that should be the price that people in regional areas should pay.</PARA>

This was followed on 14 February 1994 by direct advice from the Corporation to the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and a Western Mining Corporation Olympic Dam Operations media release. The Corporation did not inform the former Minister directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Statutory obligations for supervision and monitoring of operations of the mine rest entirely with the South Australian Government. Under the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982, a three year programme for the protection, management and rehabilitation (if appropriate) of the environment (including arrangements for monitoring) is required to be submitted to the South Australian Minister responsible. According to the Corporation, the company, independent experts and state authorities have been monitoring the local water table since operations began in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is recognised that current disclosure and reporting requirements have not been adequate and officials are currently considering options for improving arrangements. No decision has been made as a result of the announcement of the seepage about the possible involvement of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region in monitoring the operations of the Olympic Dam mine.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator Faulkner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. However, on 11 April 1994, the Australian Heritage Commission decided to enter the Beeliar Wetlands in the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate. Listing is scheduled for the next gazettal notice at the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Heritage Commission receives a large number of nominations and cannot process all nominations immediately. Priorities for assessment must be assigned, and these are based on whether the area is under threat, whether Commonwealth decisions are pending, or whether the area can be assessed as one of a suite of like places, or within a more comprehensive assessment of an entire region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Processing of the Beeliar Wetlands has not been assigned a high priority because the area has at no stage been the subject of any Commonwealth decision, and the WA State Government has been moving towards the declaration of a Park over this area. The Beeliar Wetlands is a complex nomination. Investigation and validation of the claimed values, and selection of an appropriate boundary, has therefore been a complex and lengthy task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The priorities in assessing these places were determined according to the above guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jandakot and Perth airports were placed on the Interim List on 17 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission decided on 8 February 1994 to enter Ellenbrook in the Interim List, and gazettal is scheduled for later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Leda Area has not been subject to any Commonwealth decisions, the Commission is aware that the area is likely to be subject to development proposals, and for this reason has allocated priority to its assessment. If it is found to have national estate significance, interim listing would be most likely to occur at one of the two annual interim listings in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Fifty nominations in Western Australia have been waiting for listing consideration for more than 10 years; of these three are natural environment places. In most cases these nominations have not been processed because of a lack of a sufficient level of information supplied by the nominator or otherwise available to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Commission is not required to process nominations within any specified time. Nominations are not provided for in its Act. They are a mechanism adopted by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Although there is no requirement to process nominations in a set time frame, in 1988 under a previous Minister the Commission was provided with additional resources to help process the backlog of nominations. This has led to a reduction in the overall backlog by approximately 60%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Commission is an independent statutory body. Its political independence is maintained through the appointment of independent Commissioners.</PARA>
