<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the latest balance of payments figures, which deteriorated by a disastrous 21 per cent during July and demonstrate a worsening trend. I ask: will not this deterioration in the overseas accounts accelerate as forecast private investment begins to come on-stream? When will the government concede that there is an urgent need to cut back the budget deficit if rising interest rates are not going to strangle the recovery and the promise of new jobs and reduced unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Market expectations for this month's balance of payments were in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion. It is the case that the figure that came in, at $1.8 billion, is at the higher end of that range of expectations. But the current account deficit in percentage terms did remain steady at about 3 3/4per cent of GDP in 1993-94 and it is forecast to rise only fractionally in 1994-95, even though, of course, the economy is experiencing solid recovery and, as Senator Hill says, that can be expected to suck in a considerable level of capital imports as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case, here as on every other occasion, that not too much weight should be placed on a particular month's figures&mdash;in this case, the figures for July&mdash;because of the inherent volatility in these month to month figures. The July deficit was, as I said, in the range of seasonally adjusted monthly outcomes for 1992-93 and 1993-94. It was also in the range of market expectations, and it was simply shrugged off by financial markets. If the opposition had any sense at all, and was not distracted by the dilemmas and idiocies that it has got itself involved in, it would be shrugging it off, too.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit might, of course, increase in recovery due to investment related imports and increased consumption. The increase in production capacity from capital imports should, of course, enhance the export earning capacity of the nation; that is why we do it. The budget forecasts have already made allowance for the impact of stronger economic growth on imports. As a result, there is no basis for any change in fiscal policy. Our international competitiveness has improved by around 30 per cent in the last 10 years. It has been further helped by low inflation, strong productivity growth and low wage rises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our manufactured exports continue to respond to the government's program of structural reform. I point out to Senator Macdonald that exports of ETMs in 1993-94 were 16 per cent higher than in 1992-93. That is the condition that the economy is in. The Australian government has absolutely no adjustments to make to budgetary outcomes or anything else as a result of these particular figures. The opposition knows it, and it might as well turn back to muckraking, sleaze-bagging or something else that it is a bit better at, because it is no good at attacking the government's credibility on this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Rather than what Senator Evans has said, what we are concerned about is a repeat of the same pattern that led to one million Australians being out of work. Is it not the situation that, despite the government's hype, we are back into that same pattern again, with rising balance of payments deficits which will no doubt justify the government, in its mind, forcing up interest rates as it did in the late 1980s and early 1990s to so-called dampen demand? As a result of that, we had to have the worst recession in 60 years, with nearly one million people unemployed in this country. Are we not back into exactly the same set pattern that we had before? As a result of deliberate government policy, we already have interest rates on the rise, rather than the government attempting to tackle the deficit, which might give a benefit in terms of increased jobs. Will the minister explain to the Senate why this is not simply a repeat of what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s which led to one million Australians being out of work?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is up to those on the other side who would challenge that policy course, who would draw attention to the alleged deficiencies, to say what they would do that would be any better. Where is their messiah in short pants? What is he saying about how the economy should go? Where is their particular tired and emotional policy engine?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, refers to the phenomenal performance by Australian athletes at the Commonwealth Games just concluded today in Victoria, Canada. I ask the minister: what do these results indicate for the performances of Australians in forthcoming world championships and for the 1996 Olympic Games? Can the minister indicate to the Senate how the government intends to consolidate and support this tremendous sporting success by Australian athletes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="464" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators would agree that the performance of Australian athletes at these Commonwealth Games has been truly outstanding. I believe that it is genuinely a tribute to those athletes who were involved, both our disabled athletes and those athletes without disabilities. It is also a credit to their sports and to the commitment of our national sporting bodies in Australia. Along with other senators, I would like to express my warmest congratulations to all the athletes in the Australian team.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australian athletes have been genuinely successful at the Commonwealth Games in every way. It does not matter how one measures it&mdash;whether by medals, by records, by personal bests or, perhaps much more importantly, by the sort of spirit that the athletes have shown throughout these games and in all the events in which they have participated. The medal count obviously shattered the previous best record performance at the Auckland games, and I think it is fair to say that it certainly exceeded all expectations in Australia. It confirms Australia well and truly as the leading sporting nation in the Commonwealth. It continues our excellent efforts in a whole number of sporting events. At the moment we have a record number of world champions. Australians broke 26 games records as well as two world records, which were set by Kieren Perkins in the 1,500 meters freestyle swimming event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to express my pleasure at the performances of our disabled athletes at these games. The seven medals which they won and their recent achievements in the world championships are proof that Australian disabled athletes are at the forefront of their sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made this point in Canada, and I reiterate it today in the Senate: the Australian government's policy is to provide strong support for our disabled athletes and certainly to encourage the integration of elite disabled athletes in mainstream sporting events. That is a position that I will not be resiling from as the Australian sports minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the programs developed and implemented by the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport, our elite athletes, I believe, have been provided with the support structure which is essential for international success in the sporting arena. For instance, some 80 of Australia's 170 athletes involved in AIS scholarship sports represented us at the games. Many of those athletes have received assistance in some form or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really believe that the results at this Commonwealth Games show that Australian sport really is in excellent shape. I am sure other senators would agree that the performance of our athletes has been magnificent and they deserve congratulations and support from all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Alston asked was, in fact, canvassed in some detail here in question time last week, I think in response to a question I received from Senator Gibson&mdash;Senator Gibson is nodding in assent. As I told the Senate last week, the audited accounts of ANL were tabled in the parliament, in the Senate, last year: parliamentary paper 366 of 1993. Those accounts were properly audited and, indeed, received an unqualified audit from the Australian National Audit Office, which is contained in the annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the valuation placed by the due diligence process and the figures that Senator Alston has just referred to from the audited accounts of the company was exactly as I explained it to Senator Gibson last week; that is, that the value placed by the company properly on its assets was valued essentially as the company being a going concern. The qualification placed on the valuation by the consultants that did the due diligence process was that they had valued those assets, with the discounting that Senator Alston has just referred to, on the basis of selling those assets; in other words, from the point of view of actually carrying out a liquidation of the company.</PARA>

If that is the case, how does he reconcile having one report showing a net worth as low as $118 million and ANL's own assessment, based on Drewry, in this current year which shows that it could be worth a positive $33 million?

The board of ANL, in public accounts that have been properly audited by the Australian National Audit Office, valued those assets with ANL as a going concern; in other words, it placed a positive value on things like trade shares and so on, with ANL as a going concern. The due diligence examination was qualified by saying that those values were on the basis of, effectively, a liquidation sale. They are two completely different propositions, which is why I told Senator Gibson last week that, because of the work that is now going to be done by the interim board that has been appointed by the minister, those assumptions cannot necessarily be relied upon. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

Would the minister advise the Senate when the guidelines will be issued?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The guidelines were in fact issued last Wednesday&mdash;Wednesday, 24 August&mdash;and I expected that farmers would be able to begin accessing the support when business commenced on Thursday. My office received an inquiry from a New South Wales farmer on Friday who said that he had been advised that the new guidelines were not in place. As a result of that concern, I spoke to the New South Wales minister for agriculture, Mr Causley, this morning. He assured me that the Rural Assistance Authority in New South Wales was now approving support for drought affected farmers in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to access the drought support, farmers have to satisfy the state RAS authority that their farm enterprise is in financial difficulty due to extreme drought conditions now and for two of the past three years. This guideline was put in to ensure that farmers who have obtained one good crop&mdash;and a great many of these farmers in fact did get a good crop last year&mdash;are not rendered ineligible for assistance because of that good crop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the RAS agreement with the states, policy guidelines are developed by the Commonwealth in consultation with the states. The role of the states is to assess the eligibility of farmers for support; to determine the form and level of the support, if any, and the most appropriate way of dealing with the particular circumstances facing the individual farmer; and to deliver funds and services in accordance with policy guidelines that are established by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy guidelines provide a check list of matters to be taken into account by the state authority in determining the prospects of the applicant for assistance for long-term profitability and, therefore, eligibility for support under the scheme. However, it will be necessary for the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority to exercise judgment in certain areas to ensure that support is provided to those farmers with long-term prospects who have been adversely affected by prolonged drought. I urge New South Wales farmers who believe that they may be eligible for support to contact the Rural Assistance Authority in New South Wales as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the problems facing the western division of New South Wales&mdash;I mention this particularly&mdash;have been highlighted and more sharply focused by the drought. These problems in the western division of New South Wales are structural problems. In recognition of this, I offered in a letter to the New South Wales government of 4 August to work with New South Wales to develop a regional package for the western division, with some Commonwealth funding matched by the state along the lines of the recently announced south-west Queensland strategy in the mulga lands of south-west Queensland. I do await the response of the New South Wales government to this offer by the Commonwealth. I hope that it will be a positive response.</PARA>

Does the minister agree with the assessment of the professor of accounting at the University of New South Wales, Professor Bob Walker, that the airports are worth more to taxpayers retained in government ownership than they would be if sold? In other words, would not the sale lose taxpayers money in the medium and long term and therefore should not be supported on basic business accounting principles alone?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The determination referred to by Senator Kernot is not so much the determination of the Minister for Transport. He is the minister who has carriage, but this was a cabinet decision. The cabinet chose to invite the Minister for Finance to conduct a scoping study to assess the value of the company and to prepare it for a sale. As I understand it, we have not yet received the outcome of such a scoping study. As a consequence, professor of accounting Bob Walker remains as a voice expressing an opinion. As a voice expressing an opinion, he is one voice in this debate. There are certainly many other opinions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question on the same subject is also directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I draw the minister's attention to the numerous questions that I asked Treasury in the estimates committee about this matter. One question was whether there was a natural monopoly element to the provision of airports and whether it was compatible with competition policy for there to be privatisation of a natural monopoly. Treasury responded by stating, amongst other things, that competition can occur between airports in different cities and instanced Hobart and Launceston as potentially competing airports. Treasury also stated that the sale of airports was being `carried out with a view to increasing economic efficiency rather than simply maximising sale receipts for budgetary reasons'. I therefore ask the minister: firstly, will he buy a map for the Treasury officials to show them that Hobart and Launceston are not interchangeable destinations? Secondly, if it is not all about money, why does not the government just hand the Tasmanian airports over to local authorities so as to protect Tasmanians from the whims of monopolists?<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

If there is anything in this answer that omits something that he raised in those estimates processes, I will add to this answer in due course. There are numerous ways in which airports can be competitive. Certainly, airports in Australia can be competitive by trying to attract air traffic to their point of destination. There can be a greater degree of competitiveness between airports in Australia than there currently is in respect of destination attraction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the example of Launceston and Hobart is a good one is in the eye of the beholder. What makes that competitiveness real is other modes of transport. The existence of very fast, on-surface transport at competitive cost between the eastern seaboard capital cities would mean that there would be a real choice as to the point of entry to Australia as an international destination. It is certainly the government's intention to create that type of competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, airports can be competitive in respect of non-aviation income. Many airports derive a greater degree of their income from activities other than the aviation activity. They are a major point of tourist contact as well as a major point of other activities.

These are things that have to be kept in contemplation, if I understand what Senator Harradine's line of questioning was to the Treasury officials at that estimates committee.</PARA>

This morning I was pleased to open by satellite the Australian Chamber of Manufactures conference, Australian Manufacturing `94: The Way Forward. It was a chance to evaluate the performance of the Australian manufacturing sector and look to the future and anticipate future developments that may impinge on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the performance of the Australian manufacturing sector, it is a cause for all Australians to celebrate, indeed, a very good performance. According to the Bureau of Industry Economics, manufacturing has outperformed the rest of the Australian economy: manufacturing represents 15 per cent of GDP in Australia but is responsible for 25 per cent of growth in the Australian economy since 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufacturing recovery now is much stronger than it was after the 1982-83 recession. In the first quarter of 1994 alone it created 11,300 new jobs in Australia, the third consecutive quarter in which it has added to employment growth in this country. The latest investment figures were brought out by the Capex survey referred to in the Senate on Thursday. Those figures show a massive increase in the amount of investment in new plant and equipment, indicating that the Australian manufacturing sector is gearing up to harvest the possibilities of the Asia-Pacific market and to embrace new technology to become more efficient and more competitive for this country in the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new plant and equipment shows a 14 per cent increase in growth since the last quarter. That is the highest level of growth in investment in plant and equipment since September 1990. It demonstrates that business confidence is extremely high. It also shows that what this government said in the 1994-95 budget about business investment is on track and that the target of 14.5 per cent growth in business investment based on the Capex findings last Thursday, and on what we have seen in the balance of payments figures today, is on track and will be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another marker of how manufacturing is performing is exports, and here the particularly pleasing feature is that the exports of the most complex and sophisticated manufacturing goods have increased dramatically out of Australia. ETMs, as we classify them, have increased by some 19 per cent in the last five years. We are increasingly an exporter of high quality competitive manufacturing goods. That increase for Australia is faster than the increase in other OECD countries in the world. That increase is as a result of steps taken by this government in internationalising the Australian economy. The government was pleased to put down a package of $630 million in the white paper to accelerate this growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus in Australian manufacturing is on innovation, the uptake of new technology, the development of leadership and management skills and the linkages between investment, trade and industry.

I believe that any reasonable person would say that this is a very significant contribution to the sport of weightlifting&mdash;and a very appropriate one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Teague for his question. He recently made a very interesting and thoughtful speech in the Senate about this subject. In fact, he has been making some very positive comments about a number of matters recently, many of which, I think, more people on our side than his have agreed with; nevertheless, they were worthwhile. Senator Teague has made sensible comments about this matter in a speech. I know that he has had a longstanding interest because he was a participant in that excellent report of a committee chaired by Graham Maguire which looked into our relationship with Latin America, which made a substantial contribution and to which Senator Teague previously acknowledged the government had made a very positive response. Our relationship with Latin America is a very important one. Latin America is the second fastest growing economic region in the world and therefore one in which we should take an interest. We do not wish to create the false impression that somehow or other for Australia it is going to become in any way the equivalent of South-East Asia or North-East Asia as a market, and probably not even the equivalent of the Indian Ocean, but it is nevertheless important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague raised three particular issues with regard to Chile. One is the bilateral trade agreement which Chile is thinking of entering into with New Zealand and whether we are currently proposing such an agreement. We are not currently intending to enter into such an agreement. It is of great interest to us that two of our friends are considering such an agreement, particularly when one of them is New Zealand, with which we have the closer economic relations agreement. It has not been Australia's pattern in trade policy over the years to enter into such a proliferation of bilateral trade agreements that others have. The only one we have, as Senator Teague knows, is with New Zealand. We have no current plan to extend that, although those are the sorts of issues that might be the subject of review as a result of the trade policy review being undertaken at the moment, to which I referred on a previous occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to air links, when I was in Chile we discussed the possibility of enhanced air links between Australia and Chile, but there is no commercial agreement between the two airlines about the way in which they wish to have that conducted. Therefore, the negotiations are not proceeding as quickly as I would wish. Anybody who has had to go there and gone through the various arduous routes we have to go through to get to Chile or virtually any other place in Latin America from Australia would be aware of the need for enhanced air links. It would help our trade significantly. The negotiations are tantalisingly close to agreement but I am not optimistic that they will advance quickly. But we have had discussions and we are looking forward to more of those.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until 1 July 1993, the Medicare Benefits Schedule did not differentiate between ultrasound in pregnancy relative to other uses of ultrasound. To better analyse expenditure and growth, the Medicare Schedule items for ultrasound were further disaggregated from 1 July 1993, thus enabling ultrasound in pregnancy to be identified for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94, the first year for which the data are available, Medicare benefits expenditure for ultrasound in pregnancy amounted to $29.2 million.

<PARA>The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) sought to make light of the balance of payments figures that were released today, when, in fact, Australians should really be quite concerned. Australians do not have short memories and will remember the record of this government, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the balance of payments deficit blew out. The government, particularly under Mr Keating as Treasurer of the time, believed that the answer was to force up interest rates. This, he told us, was to dampen demand, particularly in relation to imports. Interest rates continued to increase, as he found with each monthly, or thereabouts, increase the problem was unresolved, until interest rates reached a level that started to seriously and detrimentally affect business. Remaining blind to the consequences of that policy, under Mr Keating, the policy was maintained and, of course, it led to the worst recession that this country had had in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most economists and others will now look back upon those policy decisions as having been disastrous and would be deeply concerned if what we are now seeing are the early stages of a repeat of the same mistakes made by Mr Keating during that period. The misery caused by that recession is still unresolved: over a million Australians out of work, many more suffering from underemployment, and all the detrimental consequences to families and to aspirations for the future, hopes, et cetera, really amounted to a terrible period in Australia's history. As I said, it is the worst picture economically since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have these figures before us that show the balance of payments figure trending in the same direction. Worryingly, it appears to be across the indices. We see merchandise exports falling; in fact, in this period of a month they fell three per cent. So our exports of merchandise, which were supposed to be the great hope, are actually falling. Imports&mdash;which we are supposed to have found the answer to, due to increased efficiency at home and so forth&mdash;and imports of merchandise in particular, are again on the rise, also at three per cent. As for the net services balance, we saw a turnaround of that in terms of $124 million. The deficit figure of over $1.8 billion is terrible in itself, but what we see are all the trends heading in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the graphs released today and at the balance of payments account, we see not only that very worrying bottom line but also the trend line heading down further. If we look at the graph on the balance on goods and services, again we see it heading down further. If we look at the balance on merchandise trade, for the third time we see it heading in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, we reflect upon the government's policy of very recent times, we will remember that in fact this government is now starting to force interest rates up. Only a week or so ago the Reserve Bank lifted official rates and it clearly did that in conjunction with the federal government. So this government now has a deliberate policy, in order to try to arrest the deteriorating balance of payments, of again starting to force interest rates up. How is that going to help small business in particular, which is trying to recover from the recession, trying to grow and trying to employ Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great achievement! We are down to just under 900,000 still unemployed in this country. Now interest rates are going up. At the same time, the balance of payments is deteriorating. One must be very seriously concerned, I would have thought, that we are not simply going to see a repeat of the same errors that we saw previously under Mr Keating with the same disastrous results, except that this time when we go into the downturn we will go into it with a higher level of unemployment than we had at the same stage of the last cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should have taken this matter much more seriously today; he should have told the Australian people how his government has learnt from previous experiences and given them some confidence that there will not be a repeat of the horrors they have experienced in recent times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not necessary for me to repeat at any great length what I said in question time, but I make the basic point again that, according to the 1994-95 budget, the current account deficit is forecast to increase moderately in 1994-95, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP, this increase reflecting in essence the impact of strengthening domestic activity, particularly business investment, on import growth. The forecast rise is from around 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to around four per cent of GDP in 1994-95. The current account deficit has remained steady at around 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. It is expected to rise only fractionally in the coming year. The change we have seen in this month's figure, if it is sustained, is consistent with that. I make the point again, as I have so often in the past, that we simply cannot read any particular significance into these month by month figures, which do jump around, particularly when we are talking about clutching a single figure, as Senator Hill did on merchandise exports. There is no basis on which to make any adverse judgment about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as interest rates are concerned, they are still, of course, relatively low, with official cash rates only three-quarters of a percentage point, as I have often said before in this place, above its lowest level for 20 years. Official interest rates will continue to be adjusted as appropriate to reduce the risk of the economy overheating 12 to 18 months out. We want to make sure that we do not get the situation that we have had in the past where interest rate rises have been either too late or too little. We have judged the possibility of there being inflationary pressure in terms of supply and demand factors 12 to 18 months out, and that particular interest rate adjustment was judged accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach we have adopted should mean that interest rates will not need to rise to anything like the same extent as they have in past cycles. There is always a cyclical character associated with interest rate rises. We have to anticipate some increase over time as the business cycle gathers pace, as it is at the moment. We have taken the appropriate steps at the appropriate time with the appropriate order of magnitude and none of the present figures that have come out, least of all the balance of payments figures, suggest that there is any basis for reconsidering that analysis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add to and support the words of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, in taking note of an answer given by Senator Gareth Evans during question time today. Indeed, the minister's subsequent answer has simply compounded the felony of his question time answer and has revealed his total ignorance when it comes to economic matters and looking at what is happening to the economy of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agree with Senator Gareth Evans that we cannot judge too much on one month's figures. But what Senator Hill was saying was not based on one month's figures: it was based on the trend of figures of recent months released today along with the July figures. The July balance of payments current account was a deficit of $1.8 million. That is a huge deficit, but it is not uncommon in comparison with deficits in recent months and, indeed, in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's seasonally adjusted figures show that in the last four months the current account deficit has been, respectively, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and, today, $1.8 billion&mdash;that is, $6.8 billion in the last four months. That is an annual rate of $20.4 billion. That compares with a budget estimate of $18 billion. So we are running well ahead of the budget estimate at this stage which, in turn, was well above the actual outturn of $16 billion for 1993-94. I note with interest and concern that the revisions in the balance of payment figures published today show that in fact the 1993-94 outturn was almost half a billion dollars&mdash;$492 million&mdash;higher than the previously published figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the graphs published today, we see that we have a deteriorating trend in the current account deficit, as Senator Hill said. That trend has been deteriorating since approximately January of this year. We also have a deteriorating trend in the balance on goods and services. That trend has also been deteriorating for several quarters. We have a deteriorating trend in merchandise trade. That has also been happening for several quarters. If we look at the components of that, we see that the trend in exports has been flat for the last year. In July, exports actually fell by three per cent, and that included a five per cent fall in non-rural exports. So all this talk about a huge performance in exports, particularly in ETMs, is simply not supported by the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import trend, in contrast to the flat export trend, is sharply upwards. That trend has been going sharply upwards since the September quarter of 1991. In other words, that has been increasing for almost three years. In July of this year, imports, seasonally adjusted, went up another three per cent. I point out to Senator Evans that, in non-adjusted terms, imports this month rose by no less than 12 per cent. The increase in consumption goods was a staggering 18 per cent, compared with only seven per cent for capital goods. </PARA>

We have a situation where interest rates are being put up as a result of a very lax fiscal budgetary policy by this government. Interest rates will inevitably go up, and continue to go up, whilst the budget deficit remains at an excessive level. There is no suggestion that the government will change course on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to take note of Senator Gareth Evans's answer. One of the major constraints, if not the major constraint, in the growth of the Australian economy for a very long period has been the balance of payments. Every time the economy starts to gather a head of steam, we seem to be able to run into a balance of payments crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will remember, this is precisely what happened with the last recession: we ran into a massive balance of payments crisis; Mr Keating had to put the brakes on; the interest rates were raised to record levels; and we had the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Evans was somewhat cavalier when he referred to the percentage size of the deficit in relation to GDP. The fact of the matter is that Australia has, arguably, the worst balance of payments deficit amongst comparative countries. In the back of each week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> there is a large number of tables that list inter-country comparisons. Compared with 14 other countries that we like to compare ourselves with&mdash;the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, Spain and so on&mdash;the balance of payments in Australia is the absolute worst. As Senator Evans said, the current account deficit represents 3.7 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another poorly performing country, for example, Britain has a comparative figure of 1.7 per cent. Only Canada comes near the Australian figure: Canada has a current account deficit of 3.5 per cent of the GDP. However, the difference between Canada and Australia is that the forecasts for next year show that the current account deficit in Australia will rise from 3.7 per cent to 3.8 per cent whereas in Canada, clearly, action has been taken and the deficit will fall to under 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers are very keen on standing up in this parliament and telling us how well the Australian economy is performing. But the one thing they never tell us&mdash;and Senator Evans did not do this today&mdash;is why our balance of payments is amongst the worst, if not the worst, amongst comparative countries. Another explanation Senator Evans again tends to skate over is why interest rates in Australia are amongst the highest compared with other countries which have a similar industrial structure to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the answer to that question is that the two are related: the appalling balance of payments performance in this country is keeping pressure on interest rates and will certainly lead, as it did in the last recession, to further interest rate rises. So I hope that in the coming days Senator Evans will get a brief from his department and/or Treasury or the Department of Finance and they will explain to Senator Evans and give him some reasons so that he can tell us why Australia's balance of payments on its current account deficit is the worst amongst comparative countries. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Cook pointed out that some of the questions would be better directed to Senator Collins representing the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and I am grateful that Senator Collins stayed to listen to the reasons that I will advance for some intervention in this tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it should be noted that, according to information given to us by ASTAAS, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services, the tender was not advertised. No notification of the tender was given to ASTAAS whereas three other firms, British Aerospace, Sogerma&mdash;French&mdash;and Air France were invited to tender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTAAS officials read about the tender in the newspaper&mdash;not in an advertisement, but in an article in the business pages. Thereafter, ASTAAS officials approached Qantas on repeated occasions. Qantas kept saying that no decision had been reached about advertising for stand-down until early June. In early June, Qantas finally handed over&mdash;and, I must say, extremely casually from all accounts&mdash;not a letter of invitation but just specifications plus a scrawled note; in other words, tender specifications. The bid was submitted by the due date, 9 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tender specifications were drawn up by Qantas and some work orders were repeated. In mid-June ASTAAS revised the tender of the basis of the mistakes found in the tender specifications. Qantas was supposed to come back to ASTAAS on 22 June to negotiate aspects of the tender bid. The understanding was that it was to be a two-step tender and some negotiation would take place after the first tender was submitted. This was never done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lance Strong, of ASTAAS, repeatedly asked Qantas what was happening and was told that no information was available. Finally, the union, through some Qantas flight attendants, found out that British Aerospace had got the contract on or about 11 August, and the union then informed ASTAAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also put on record that ASTAAS was aware of other bids which were cheaper&mdash;but only because the tenderers were asked to tender on a different basis due to ASTAAS having incomplete tender documentation. ASTAAS had tendered on the basis of `examination and termination' while the others had tendered on the basis of `examination' only. This constitutes a major difference between the medical costs associated with diagnosis verses the medical costs of diagnosis plus treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTAAS felt that it would have had to be competitive based on an accurate tender process, given that it had agreed to 40 per cent lower labour rates to win the job. ASTAAS also felt that the `time required' of British Aerospace was technically not feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these matters I have put on the record on behalf of ASTAAS should be sufficient to cause the minister to take a very close interest in this tendering process. The minister has the authority to review this matter and put it back to tender. In addition, the Australian public, through the government, holds 75 per cent of the shares in Qantas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as Senator Spindler requested, I have waited in the chamber to hear his concerns on this matter. I make the point that the awarding of maintenance contracts is clearly a commercial matter for the management of Qantas. However, I would be interested in reading to the Senate a statement on this matter issued by James Strong, the managing director of Qantas, on 22 August 1994. Mr Strong said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a definite bias in favour of Australian companies when it comes to purchasing goods and services. However we insist that bids are competitive. Qantas cannot carry extra costs as a penalty for firms that are not able to be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have briefed ASTAAS, the relevant unions and the ACTU on why heavy maintenance work on our four Airbus 300 aircraft was awarded to British Aerospace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTAAS were uncompetitive on costs and almost every other aspect including experience and capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would have had to lease heavy jacking equipment from overseas. They would have had to bring in engineering expertise from Qantas and from overseas sources. Their turnaround time on the four aircraft exceeded that of British Aerospace by about three months. This would have meant very significant revenue loss to Qantas. We use the A300s on high density domestic routes such as Sydney/Melbourne and we cannot afford to have them out of the operational fleet for one day longer than necessary, let alone for many weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Engineering staff were advised by ASTAAS earlier this year of a minor improvement in turnaround for their bid. Unfortunately they were unable to improve the terms sufficiently to be considered for the contract on the A300s.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read that statement in response because I am not sure whether Senator Spindler has seen it. It comprises very specific assertions that have been made by Qantas, indicating not only that the bid from ASTAAS was uncompetitive in price but also&mdash;I imagine this would be a matter of grave concern to an airline company&mdash;it would have had the aircraft out of the air for three months longer than the overseas bid. Considering the degree to which a company needs to utilise an aircraft to recover capital cost, let alone to make a profit, I imagine that must have been of very great concern to Qantas. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the minister for his answer clarifying the New South Wales rural adjustment scheme funding. I wish to place on record the exact cost of the drought in New South Wales at the moment. There is a loss of some $400 million in the cotton areas; something like $600 million in the wheat areas; about $6.5 million in sorghum; about $77 million in the barley industry; about $28 million in the oat crop; about $45 million in the canola crop; about $100 million in the wool industry, because of the loss of stock; and the beef industry is untold at this stage. It is a big loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the minister for clarifying the situation somewhat by making an explanation to the New South Wales minister today.

<PARA>We have spent quite a bit of time over the last three days trying to find words that everyone would be happy with so that we would not have to spend what might indeed end up being close to an hour debating the matter in this place. Unfortunately, we could not get the Liberal Party of Australia to agree that we actually support Cathy or commend her in any way for her actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave Senator Campbell to argue on behalf of members of the Liberal Party why they feel very reluctant to actually go as far as supporting Cathy for her actions, but I point out that many Australians, and indeed many members of the Liberal Party, have openly gone further than simply acknowledging Cathy's right to carry the Aboriginal flag and have supported her actions. This issue has obviously, as everybody knows, been brought to a head by the decision of Mr Tunstall to reprimand Cathy for those actions. It has certainly put the issue on the public agenda. The feedback that we have been getting is that an overwhelming number of Australians support Cathy for her decision to openly recognise and indeed applaud her Aboriginal heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go through some quotes from various media reports. These are why I find it amazing that we are now debating this motion rather than simply letting it go through as formal. I start with the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Opposition Leader, Mr Downer, have expressed support for Freeman but declined to comment on Mr Tunstall's actions.</PARA>

This one is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 26 August and refers to the Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister, Kevin Prince, who also supported Freeman, saying she was representing Australia and representing her people. Then the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, is quoted as saying Freeman had the right to demonstrate the fact she was an Aborigine. I move on to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;this is also of Friday, 26 August&mdash;where the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, said that Mr Tunstall had been `at one games too many'. Mr Kennett described Freeman's win and subsequent celebration as `absolutely beautiful' and `stunning'. I comment again that I cannot understand why the word `support' is causing so many problems for members of the Liberal Party in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support this motion and the substantive motion in the terms that have been moved by Senator Lees. I must say that I think it is important that the Senate today give consideration to this issue. I think some controversy has been raised in the community about the actions of Cathy Freeman after winning in the first instance the 400-metre track event in Victoria. Subsequent to her being the first gold medal winning female Aboriginal athlete for an individual event, Cathy also won the 200-metre track event. Again, I say that it is an outstanding result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that Cathy's display of her pride in her Aboriginal heritage was a most appropriate course of action for her to take. I believe that the vast majority of Australians also interpreted her actions after her success in both those events as being very unifying for the Australian people. There is no doubt at all that Cathy's own expression after the races were completed that she saw herself as a role model for the Aboriginal community and particularly for young Aboriginal sports people was a most important action for her to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become clear that there has been a very widespread level of support in the community for Cathy's actions in Victoria. I might say that it did not take the Australian Sports Commission until Cathy won the 400-metre track event in Victoria to realise what an important role model she is for the Aboriginal community. The Australian Sports Commission has for some time used Cathy Freeman under a small honorarium to promote its junior Aussie sport program with particular emphasis on Aboriginal children. Cathy has participated on several occasions in workshops and other events. Just before the team left for the Commonwealth Games, she was the special guest at a major Aussie sport expo which was held in Brisbane in your state, Mr Acting Deputy President, where she had an opportunity to address some 400 children. She has also been involved in visits and meetings in the Northern Territory working with Aboriginal communities and groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Cathy's training program prohibits her to some extent from having a very extensive involvement in these activities, it certainly is a very important role for her to play. I believe that the actions of Cathy after her victories are ones that have been accepted very widely in the Australian community. There has been a tremendous outpouring of support for what she has done in her quite extraordinary athletic achievements. There are not many athletes in our history who have been successful in these two blue riband events at the Commonwealth Games. Two that come to mind in recent years are Debbie Flintoff-King and Raelene Boyle, both of whom have had success in the 400-metre event and of course Raelene also in the shorter sprints. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, as you correctly pointed out to the two previous speakers, we are debating a motion for the suspension of standing orders. I would like to explain why it is that, with great regret, the opposition parties will not be supporting the motion. When notice of the original substantive motion was given on the last sitting day, it congratulated Cathy Freeman on her gold medal performances; congratulated her for becoming the first Aboriginal woman athlete to compete for individual Commonwealth gold medals; and commended her, in broad terms, for her decision to carry the Aboriginal flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After consultation with some of my colleagues, I recommended to Senator Lees last week that, in a fortnight when we have seen hundreds of Australian athletes of all races and ethnic backgrounds doing Australia proud, it was not only unfair to them but also in many ways unfair to Cathy to single her out for her achievement and seek to further politicise unnecessarily her decision&mdash;which the opposition has recognised in a number of public statements, including my own which was published on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. That would be an inappropriate thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason we sought to amend the motion. I am glad that Senator Lees and the Australian Democrats found it appropriate to incorporate the substantive amendments which I drafted. In particular, my draft clause 1 congratulates all Australians athletes, and clause 4 specifically `commends Cathy for her pride in her Aboriginal heritage and the inspiration and encouragement she provides to young Australians, and particularly young Aboriginal Australians'. I put a lot of thought into that drafting on behalf of the coalition and on behalf of all senators, because I think the Senate in these things should reflect the views of all Australians and not try to take sides and to therefore politicise things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that it has had to come to a debate as to the wording of a motion. Indeed, earlier this afternoon the Australian Democrats came to me and said that they wanted to include clause 5 specifically supporting the decision to carry the Aboriginal flag. As the minister has just said, that is a matter that the community has found to be contentious and that has in some ways divided the community. I think most people would not really care less and would not want to see controversy surrounding this, but the fact is that there is controversy. So we sought to find, over the last hour or so, a set of words which everyone could agree to, to ensure that the Senate would not have to spend its time debating a motion and politicising the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only second guess what Senator Lees's motivation is in forcing a debate on the wording of the motion regarding Cathy's decision to carry the two flags on her laps of honour. I would be very sorry if, deep inside her, part of that motivation was to fuel further controversy. We tried extremely hard to ensure that the motion subtly reflected and incorporated the views of all Australians and did not seek to be controversial. That is why we oppose the suspension of standing orders; it is not over support for Cathy Freeman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been at the forefront in supporting her performance and what is the best performance at the Commonwealth Games of any Australian team. It has made all of us feel proud, particularly those of us who have involvement with Aboriginal people in our working lives. Cathy's achievement is special, particularly for that section of the community which does require role models and does need, more than many others, positive reinforcements of successful Aboriginal individuals. The coalition, by supporting the original wording of the motion, was showing its enthusiasm for that concept. All we were seeking to do was to find an appropriate course of action in relation to the controversial part. We thought that to use another set of words would have been better. That is why we will oppose the motion to suspend standing orders. I indicate that the coalition will seek to amend clause 5 during the substantive motion. </PARA>

Of course, there were one or two people in Australia who disagreed with her, but I would have thought that 90 per cent-plus of the Australian population welcomed what Cathy did. It was unfortunate that Cathy Freeman was initially criticised by Mr Tunstall&mdash;and supported by Mr Ruxton&mdash;for holding up the Aboriginal flag.

All Australians, other than that very small handful, recognise that this was one of the great symbolic acts of reconciliation between non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal Australians. I did not actually see the race itself; I saw the replay. Even watching the replay, I was stirred emotionally, as I would think all Australians were. First of all, she was a great athlete amongst many great athletes at those games. Secondly, she was so proud of her Aboriginality, she was willing to display a flag that only 20 years ago was seen as radical and divisive but which now, quite rightly, is seen as a symbol of reconciliation.

It is regrettable that the motion cannot be passed as an unanimous position of the Senate. The Greens (WA) certainly supported the notice of motion being declared formal. We also support the suspension of standing orders which allows people at least to express their reservations and reasons for not being able to give the motion unequivocal support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell's comments are a good example of this. I am very pleased that he has had the opportunity to state his position and say that his inability to support the motion does not indicate a lack of appreciation of Cathy's achievement. I commend his comments about the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy Freeman's action was a beautiful, spontaneous gesture which enriches all Australians and which only became political afterwards in the minds of those for whom it was already political. Occasionally there is a direct moment of truth that is communicated vividly to people around the world as they watch an action on television or hear it discussed. Certainly, Cathy's gesture of pride for and in her people has touched a community nerve. It has also raised mixed feelings in this chamber and the community. The Greens support the motion to suspend standing orders to allow the notice of motion to be debated and voted on because in the end it will say much more about the members of this Senate than about Cathy or her actions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator Campbell in opposing the motion to suspend standing orders. I do so for a variety of reasons, one of which is the reasoning behind this motion. Really, the debate on whether to suspend standing orders has degenerated into a debate about the Australian flag and its worthiness. I think it has more to do with that than it does with Cathy Freeman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am opposed to the suspension of standing orders because another notice of motion was given today by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, which I think is far more appropriate in that it congratulates all Australian athletes, all those who took part in the games in Victoria, British Columbia. It congratulates all those who won medals and does not single out anybody for any particular achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees, in moving the motion to suspend standing orders, gave a lot of quotes from various members of the Liberal Party throughout Australia. She failed to mention that all of those quotes were in response to a specific, direct question asked about one specific athlete in Cathy Freeman. I understand the responses that were made and certainly would agree with most of them. But when it comes to recognising the efforts of our athletes in the Commonwealth Games, I do not like to see us singling out any athlete, whether that athlete has been successful or not as successful in his or her pursuit of gold medals. I think specifically of an athlete who broke two world records and yet does not get a mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard Senator Lees and Senator Schacht say that carrying the Aboriginal flag was an act of reconciliation, but I think singling out one person in this case does not do anything at all for reconciliation. If anything, highlighting those issues brings out the divisions that apply in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht says that we do not have a flag that is genuinely Australian. I disagree totally with him because I do not know of anybody who does not think Australia's flag is a genuine Australian flag. It is the flag of our nation. I am sure that when senators were younger they looked upon the flag with some pride. Probably even Senator Schacht in his younger days looked on it with some pride. But in recent times he has changed his view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am opposed to the suspension of standing orders basically because today Senator Faulkner, as minister for sport, gave notice of a notice of motion which I believe is far more appropriate in the recognition of the efforts of all of our athletes that went to Victoria, British Columbia, to compete on behalf of Australia in the Commonwealth Games. That team included not only people who have been Australian residents for a very long time but also some people from other countries who have recently chosen Australia as their place of residence. For those reasons, I oppose the suspension of standing orders. </PARA>

It is a great pity that Phillip Christou and the Australian Weightlifting Federation should have tainted that. All the athletes made a great contribution.

<PARA>I will be brief as I believe the opposition has other speakers as well as the two who have already spoken. I want to pick up a couple of points that have come out of the debate so far. Firstly, understanding is the key issue. The whole question is about the difference between understanding and supporting what Cathy Freeman has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that understanding is simply not enough. Indeed, there is a lack of understanding by the coalition of how important this act was for her. The key to the whole debate before us now is the coalition's lack of understanding of the importance of this to Cathy. I think it was Senator Ferguson who said that this was not just a sudden and spontaneous gesture on her part&mdash;she indeed packed that flag. Only Cathy can tell us about her feelings when she made that decision. But I imagine it was a very careful decision; a decision that was bound up in her feelings about her Aboriginal heritage and its importance to her. Indeed, one of the issues that spurred her on to her successes may have been her desire to show the world how she felt about her Aboriginal heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is very significant for this chamber to support Cathy in her actions; to support her in her pride for her traditional heritage, her Aboriginal heritage. Reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians will not be possible unless we have a greater understanding of the importance of such issues. We have singled out Cathy from among all the athletes, not just because of her performance obviously but because of the Aboriginal heritage issue. I hope that we can come to a calm, sensible and reasoned debate in this chamber on this issue and acknowledge its importance for all Australians, not just Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators support all of the motion, more than half of which we drafted. The most upsetting issue here today is that, in the face of quite extensive efforts by a number of people around this place to get a set of words and to avoid this debate, the Australian Democrats found it necessary to push and impose their view on the whole of Australia, regardless of the fact that other people may have found their wording slightly, as it is, inappropriate. As I said in the debate on the motion to suspend standing orders, one can only assume that Senator Lees, as the Democrats' spokesperson for sport sees some political advantage in doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saddest thing about what I have heard today in the debates on the various motions is that politicians around here would seek to attribute motives as to why Cathy Freeman did what she did and to second-guess what she did. Minister Schacht said that Cathy did what she did because she thought the Australian flag was not representative of her total feelings. He decided that that is what Cathy thought when she made her decision. Senator Lees tried to guess Cathy's feelings. Basically, we had a bunch of politicians guessing what went through Cathy's mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great shame that the Democrats sought to politicise further the decision of a young Australian athlete. That is what I thought most sad. This is one of the saddest days of my time in parliament. Senator Bell would accuse me of false indignation and so forth on this issue. When I discussed this with my leader, Senator Hill said, `Why do you look so upset about this? Why do you look so worried about it?' I said, `I am so worried because one of the worst things I have had to do is to say that we need this debate when we do not need to.' The whole chamber could have agreed unanimously on a set of words but Senator Lees wanted to dig her heels in and further politicise this. That is disgraceful and very upsetting&mdash;it has upset me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that we have to stand around for an hour on a Monday afternoon, trying to debate the motives of a young Aboriginal athlete who has done something so good for herself, her nation and young Aboriginals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is improper for the Australian Democrats to come in here and use&mdash;as the minister says&mdash;the wrong word. Where we are supposed to have a non-controversial measure, we have instead the deliberate introduction of controversy and conflict over a matter on which this Senate should be overjoyed and unanimous. I regret what the Australian Democrats have done because, unfortunately, it will reflect on our whole appreciation and recognition of Cathy Freeman. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying is, for heavens sake, why could not the Democrats have found another word and made it something that was not a controversial, political issue where they are clearly, on their own admission, having a go at Arthur Tunstall. That is the simple uncomplicated thing. This motion is deliberately aimed at having a go at the head of mission. If the Democrats want to do that, they should do it in a separate motion. They should not tie it in with a great young Australian woman athlete who has done her community, her nation and herself so proud at these Commonwealth Games. It is regrettable that the Australian Democrats should tarnish what should be a moment of joy for us all with this controversial issue which is unnecessary, unkind and unwelcome. </PARA>

Of course they should not fly those flags because they are not Australian flags.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also repeals the National Fitness Act 1941. This Act was enacted because of concerns over the physical fitness of Australian youth for military service during the Second World War. The Act established a National Fitness Council to advise the Minister and a Trust Account, the National Fitness Fund, for monies appropriated for the purpose of furthering the objects of the Act including setting up State Fitness Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act fell into disuse during the 1970s when the functions of the Commonwealth and State Fitness Councils were taken over by other bodies. The National Fitness Council was phased out in 1975 and the National Fitness Fund was last used in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the balance in the National Fitness Fund, currently $129.00, to be transferred to Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>

Currently powers under Western Australian laws in force in the Indian Ocean Territories are vested exclusively in the responsible Minister who delegates the powers to the Parliamentary Secretary. This amendment will simplify administration matters when there is a change of Minister or Parliamentary Secretaries.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">makes three amendments to the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. Firstly to make it clear that the definition of `Commonwealth Agency' does not include any person in the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island Governments and their instrumentalities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That regulation 4 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1994 No. 56 and made under the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>Last Monday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) addressed a justice forum held here in Parliament House. In his speech, Mr Keating made the following statements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to access to justice and equality before the law. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While access to our courts must, of course, remain available to all, it is clear that many cases would be better resolved without resort to expensive and adversarial court action. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must work to expand alternatives to litigation, while ensuring that dispute resolution remains just and fair.</PARA>
<PARA>This disallowance motion, if passed, would do precisely what the Prime Minister said the government wants to do. It would provide access to justice for people who want to take a complaint to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal which requires the evaluation of medical evidence. The only recourse they have at the moment is the courts which, for many people, is just not an option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation the Democrats are seeking to disallow excludes medical cases from the tribunal's jurisdiction. The government, along with the superannuation and life insurance industries, has put forward a number of arguments to support that exclusion. The superannuation committee has examined those arguments in some detail, and its findings may be found in the report tabled in the Senate a short time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The force of the government's arguments can be gauged from the committee's unanimous view that it is not convinced that there is not a role for the tribunal to play in dealing with medical complaints. It was suggested to us that to allow the hearing of medical complaints would swamp the tribunal with medical cases, and that the tribunal lacked the expertise to deal with them. I will not go over the committee's responses to those claims other than to say that no evidence was provided to support them; if anything, the evidence pointed in the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, these objections provide absolutely no justification for a blanket exclusion of medical cases. If resources or expertise are really a problem, then there are less draconian solutions available. My appeal to honourable senators is that, if they believe a compromise is needed, then they are certain to get one if they vote for this disallowance. If the motion is defeated, then the government will be under much less pressure to address the real concerns raised by the regulation. Disallowing it is guaranteed to focus the mind of the government very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This regulation has caused a good deal of disquiet. Our attention was first drawn to it by the Australian Consumers Association, and I acknowledge its efforts to have it overturned. But opposition to it has since spread to within the government itself. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Administrative Review Council were both highly critical, and they have been joined in the last few days by the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. I thought the Administrative Review Council neatly disposed of the floodgates argument against disallowance. Its submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Council does not consider that the possibility that the Tribunal might be asked to consider a large number of complaints of a particular type justifies excluding those complaints from the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>I would go further than that. I would argue that the possibility of a large number of complaints strengthens the case for an alternative to the courts. To argue that we should not provide access to justice where the need is greatest is to turn principle on its head. Why not go all the way and bar them from being challenged in the courts as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a former Labor minister, Peter Walsh, who once wrote a newspaper article expressing amazement at how much credibility we give lobby groups whose position is based solely on self-interest. This is a classic case in point. Basically, all the industry is saying is: `Please leave medical cases with the courts because hardly anyone will challenge us if we deny them disability benefits.' Surely that is no basis for upholding this regulation. I would like to read part of a submission from Maurice Blackburn &amp; Co, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our submission that many of the perceived problems with disability claims would be overcome if superannuation funds had effective claims procedures in place and moved away from a confrontationist attitude to disability claims made by members. If they did so, they would be providing a valuable service and benefit to members.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only say, `Hear, hear.' The regulation flies in the face of the access to justice action plan, which was released to widespread approval earlier this year. The plan spells out the principles on which an adequate complaints scheme could be based. One principle is that the scheme should be comprehensive in that it should cover all of the main activities of industry participants. In failing to cover the disability insurance activities of the superannuation industry, the tribunal clearly falls short of the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This regulation also falls foul of anti-discrimination principles. I have a letter from the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Hastings, to the Australian Consumers Association. Ms Hastings suggests that the exclusion of medical cases from the tribunal is a form of indirect discrimination, and is not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. Ms Hastings has, in effect, placed the government on notice that the regulation would not survive a review under the Disability Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise the arguments against this regulation, it reduces the accessibility of justice and discriminates against the disabled. I remind honourable senators that the only way to make the government come up with a compromise position is to disallow this regulation. Therefore, I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is not convinced that there is not a role for the Tribunal to play in dealing with medical complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that, notwithstanding the outcome of the disallowance motion, the government re-examine the issue in the light of:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)  the experience of the Tribunal over its first six months of operation; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee further recommends that the Government:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)   seeks advice from the Regulations and Ordinances Committee on the appropriate legislative instrument for defining the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that to be a very fair and sensible conclusion and recommendation which had the unanimous support of all of the committee's members from all the major parties in this Senate. Since the putting down of that report in the last one hour, we have examined ways which will try to expedite the government looking at the matters that we put down. It has been put to us that the government will agree to amend the regulation so that it has no effect after six months from today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with that approach is that the government cannot amend this regulation. It can issue a new regulation. I submit that, under the circumstances, to make sure there is no doubt about the intent, the neatest approach is for us to proceed to disallow the motion. Then the government can, in the fullness of time, issue a new regulation or, if need be, it can amend the act. There is a whole range of options open to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the opportunity in the intervening time to talk to the Australian Consumers Association. I was appalled to learn from the association that the government intends to exclude from the tribunal's jurisdiction life companies. They are going to be excised from the jurisdiction of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole intent of setting up this tribunal in the first place is going to be, to use a vulgar term, gutted. This raises a further problem in my mind as to the government's bona fides in this whole issue. Therefore, the clearest and neatest approach to make sure that everybody acts with the integrity that we expect is for it to be disallowed. That will put pressure on the government to come back and look at these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the impact on people's lives of the Senate's action if we defer this matter. However, the government is concerned about a possible stacking up problem. If it were really concerned about this, it would have done a number of things. By now, nearly two months after the start of the tribunal, it would have put in place a chairperson but it has been rather slow in this regard. There is a deputy but not a chairperson in charge of the tribunal. If it were bona fide about its commitment to the tribunal, it would have had this person in place. If it is worried about stacking up, it is certainly going about matters the right way to stack things up, because it does not have a chairperson to look at matters. After all, the tribunal should have been in operation two months ago. It is not as though there has not been time to appoint one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: is the government committed to putting the resources into this body or is it not? How committed is the government to this concept if it is talking about excluding life companies from the tribunal? We know that there are already problems in terms of government instrumentalities that cannot get access to the tribunal at the present time. It is true that it is saying, `We're going to take steps to overcome this with the support of other bodies.' But where is the commitment? There are three examples of this lack of commitment to urgency. We are providing the trigger mechanism to make sure that the government provides the degree of urgency of attention to this matter that we on this side of the chamber believe is absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to establish that this tribunal is not a paper tiger just to keep consumers quiet. I think our action will demonstrate the Senate's commitment to looking after the interests of consumers. We believe that the report is a responsible one. It gives time to disallow and adequate time to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now look at a number of the arguments. The first one is in relation to the disability discrimination legislation, and this does worry me. The Attorney-General's Department submitted that the exclusion of medical complaints is an act carried out in direct compliance with the law, other than the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. It is thereby exempt under that act for a period of three years. However, after the three-year period expires on 1 March 1996, the issue of inconsistency will have to be determined. This will be done on the basis of existing evidence as to the reasons for the continued need for the exclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jurisdiction of the tribunal should not be restricted out of fear that it will be unable to determine matters involving medical evidence or that there will be a floodgates problem in terms of complainants. The tribunal should be given a mandate to hear medical matters. If it becomes necessary in assessment to determine whether there is a problem with floodgates or that inappropriate determinations could be made, the Senate select committee has a reference to examine the first 12 months of the operation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the floodgates argument, therefore, cannot be sustained, because the experience of other tribunals&mdash;such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the one dealing with social security matters, known as the SSAT&mdash;is that there has not been a floodgates phenomenon. This is merely scare tactics from vested interests. The possibility that the tribunal may be asked to consider a large number of complaints of a particular type does not justify excluding those complaints from the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of mechanisms could be utilised. We are here to try to help solve the government's problems. Here are some ways in which the difficulties can be overcome: a tribunal which can effectively and efficiently deal with matters involving medical evidence; the use of inquisitorial procedures; the use of independent medical experts appointed by the tribunal; medically qualified members of the tribunal; members of the tribunal, whether qualified or not, to judge the evidence; a panel of medical experts; and various other techniques that are utilised by a host of other tribunals that satisfactorily deal with medical complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the question of cost? Cost of access to more formal legal forums would be prohibitive to almost all of those who would be challenging a disability claim. These are the people for whom I think every honourable senator has a great deal of sympathy. The cost of justice in this country is prohibitive. The Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, has referred to it on a number of occasions. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has spoken about it. This is a practical resolution of their concerns, and I believe we must follow it to ensure that they match their rhetoric with positive action. An example of the high costs is that it costs upwards of $20,000 for an applicant to conduct a matter in a state Supreme Court. These costs are prohibitive for the ordinary Australian; they are prohibitive for people lying on their backs who wish to lodge a particular claim. We have to ensure that the tribunal that is set up is simpler and easier for consumers than the adversarial court system which others support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that there may be some discrepancy between trustees' decisions and decisions of an insurance company with whom a benefit is insured is irrelevant when defining the jurisdiction of a federal tribunal. The issue of whether a death or disability cover by a superannuation fund should be optional needs to be addressed in its own right, not by way of avoiding any conflicts by effectively denying access to a dispute resolution. The conduct of medical cases before the tribunal may provide an impetus for funds to review the provisions of these types of benefits and tailor them appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out that it was not until today that the principal lobby group&mdash;the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia&mdash;put in a submission on this issue. Surely, lobby groups would be aware of what is going on in relation to matters in their interest, such as matters that are before a Senate select committee and matters that are the subject of disallowance motions. Yet the lobby groups chose, for some reason, to ignore the committee until today&mdash;until the last possible opportunity. It does surprise me that another lobby group&mdash;the Life Insurance Federation&mdash;in its submission did not address the matter until last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the question as to where these lobby groups are. It is true that, on the one hand, they have made statements in the public media that they do not like these sorts of things. On the other hand, government departments and ministers have spoken in support of extending the jurisdiction of these sorts of tribunals. It seems to be an anachronism that the private sector body that looks at these matters has a jurisdiction wider than what was originally intended for this tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a good case, and the factual information to support our recommendations is in the report. Nobody is losing face in terms of what we are putting forward. It is a very constructive type of approach which is designed to assist everybody. The argument about a backlog of cases worries me. Can one assume from that that there is a bank of data before the tribunal about which our committee has not been informed? We need to be told whether or not there is a backlog. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the government running scared that the tribunal will not be able to cope? Why has the tribunal not got a full complement of staff in place as well as its permanent chair? SIS and its tribunal have not been a national secret for the past 12 months, and that surprises me about the whole approach of the industry to this particular disallowance motion. I believe that we have provided the most appropriate mechanism to enable the government with a degree of dignity to address this matter in so far as medical complaints are concerned. I had hoped that the government might have been able to give us more time to negotiate but, in view of the fact that the motion was brought on, we had to respond in the way that we have. </PARA>

<PARA>That was a mechanical matter because we received some evidence which indicated that somebody thought one could not do this. However, the regulations and ordinances committee raised no objections about this when it examined the regulation, so that needs to go there to be looked at. Two hours ago we had the tabling of the report in which the committee said that the government should review this issue after it has looked at the first six months of operation. It should look at what other alternatives and mechanisms are available. Now what do we have? Two hours later we are being told to rescind the regulation. This raises a whole series of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the claim that no negotiations and discussions had taken place, given that the government had always opposed the disallowance motion and the fact that we did not know until question time what position the opposition would take, it is a little difficult for us to be culpable in that regard. But I can say that the government agrees that it will amend the regulation so that it has no effect after six months from today. This will enable full consideration of the Senate select committee's report and ensure that the question of any exclusion of medical evidence comes before the Senate again within six months. The government has demonstrated very clearly its commitment to reviewing this particular issue. That does not seem to be enough for some people; they choose not to believe us, and I am very sorry about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be the effect of the disallowance of this regulation? It means that, as of whatever time it is disallowed, medical matters can go before the tribunal. That means that there will be a backlog and a delay because those people who did not take their matter to the tribunal as it was a medical matter will now be able to do so. There is no increase in budget for the tribunal. This is a tribunal that was designed to be cheap, speedy and fair in dispute resolution. But in one fell swoop we are increasing quite dramatically the workload of this tribunal, without giving any compensation or recompense for the budgetary constraints and considerations that might result. That is something that I think all members should be concerned about&mdash;what we do about that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also I do not think there is anybody on the tribunal with medical expertise or knowledge. It can be quite complicated to work through and understand different medical problems and issues. There is no point in the tribunal just appointing one medical officer, because we are going to get&mdash;and we have all seen it, I guess, with our constituents&mdash;people with a variety of problems coming through the doors. We might have one with a veterans' affairs problem relating to medical issues or another with a social security problem relating to complex medical issues. So we get into very specialised areas involving a great deal of specialist knowledge and consideration, and we expect a person who may be either generally trained or specialist trained in one area to look at another area. The medical problems there are quite considerable and, I think, need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson suggested that there could be an expert medical panel. Doctors are a bit like lawyers; they do not come cheap. If we are going to have a medical experts panel, we are going to have to pay them for their time. So we should because we are not asking specialists to give up their time for nothing. They could be providing assistance or providing a service elsewhere and being recompensed, as they should be. It is their livelihood. But that is another issue that has to be resolved. How are we going to overcome these differences of medical opinion and disputes in which two doctors disagree? If we pull up two different experts, we may find that the doctors disagree with one another on very complex issues. They are not quite like economists where we have two economists and get three opinions or solicitors where we would get a lot of opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues need to be considered. This is why the government is saying, `Whoa, look, we will review this but just hold it and in six months' time we will be able to bring in something that will possibly enable a flow-on and a transition to take place.' We cannot just sort of snap it off in mid air and leave everybody to take what they want, with no guidelines, no mechanisms worked out for how this issue is to be addressed and resolved. That is a very sorry situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, be careful you do not look in a mirror. One of the issues I think we have to keep going back to is what this will do to the workload of the tribunal. As I said earlier, this tribunal's process is for cheap and speedy dispute resolution. We are adding, without any extra resources or guidelines, a whole new area for it to look at and one has to ask what the impact of this will be. We also need to be aware of the possible effect of this on some of the companies. Disability benefits are usually paid in a lump sum. They are generally larger than the benefit available for resignation and retirement. This therefore is an incentive for people to&mdash;and I am not saying this without justification&mdash;attempt to become eligible for disability benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the different superannuation funds we have differing medical disability regulations and agreements. There is nothing common about the guidelines for provision of benefits. This lack of standard format will cause the tribunal quite a deal of problems. It will also cause the industry itself a problem. If we give the industry six months, we will be sending a message to it that it has to look at a way in which it can get some commonality in its definition of its guidelines. This will have a beneficial effect on the people who are joining these funds because they will then not have to read the fine print in each one of them to see precisely what each one offers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question has been raised about the prudential costs to a small fund if somebody gets a very large disability payout. The other thing that has to be asked is: what will the impact be in the future for those future superannuation contributors? Will some of the funds just opt totally out of disability and death benefits? Are those the sorts of things that might happen? Are we going to cut something off? We cannot answer those questions here tonight. These are the sorts of questions that can be resolved in this six-month buffer period that the government is offering to people, but people do not seem to want to do things in an ordered and sensible manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly heard the opposition leader saying that he wants things that have commonsense to them. It strikes me that, if we do not allow people to amend their current situation and to address some of the issues before something is implemented, that is not a particularly commonsense point of view. Maybe it is commonsense when it applies only to things of the opposition's making and not anybody else's. Perhaps those opposite are the only ones who think they have commonsense. This obviously proves that they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to add a great deal more except to just repeat that the government agrees that it will amend the regulation&mdash;well, it would have amended the regulation. The signs from the other side indicate that the regulation will be disallowed. The government will amend the regulation so that it has no effect after six months from today. This will enable full consideration of the Senate select committee's report and ensure that the question about any exclusion of medical evidence comes before the Senate again within six months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens support Senator Woodley's Superannuation Complaints Tribunal disallowance motion. I listened carefully to the speech by Senator West, but I feel that it is not beyond the realms of possibility that a tribunal can organise to call on specialised medical advice as required. It would not be terribly complicated. If there are problems with the way the tribunal is operating or has operated, it is a matter of dealing with those problems. I do think that not disallowing a motion where there is an accepted&mdash;even from the government's point of view&mdash;difficulty and inequity involved and continuing for another six months will solve any problems. A disallowance would effectively permit the complaints tribunal to hear cases where people requesting disability allowance were turned down. We believe that such cases may be a significant part of the number of people having problems with superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law as it stands forbids anyone unable to work from seeking a resolution through the tribunal and puts them in a position where they must either give up or proceed through the courts. People seeking disability allowance are likely to be unemployed or, at best, only partially employed and so are economically disadvantaged. We see no reason why they should be forced into the difficult and expensive option of the courts, where they must compete directly against the economic and legal power of superannuation and insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal was set up to allow quicker and less expensive means of resolution, and these people should not be excluded from this facility. The only excuse the government can present is that the tribunal does not have the expertise to determine between conflicting medical experts. It appears to us that the tribunal would have exactly as much expertise as the courts. For this reason, there is no reason disabled people should be denied the process of complaint available to others dissatisfied with their treatment by superannuation companies. It is absolutely necessary to have good, accessible complaint resolution where the government is trying to make superannuation the basic form of retirement income security. If, by the way, that tribunal is not working as well as it should at the moment, there is always the ability to improve it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on some of the comments that have been made and to support the comments that have been made by Senator Watson. A couple of issues have been raised by Senator West that probably require some response. Firstly, the matter of whether or not medical complaints could be taken before the tribunal was an issue which was discussed at great length by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and also, I guess, was one that we agonised over for some time because of the complexities involved in it. There was a certain amount of give and take and a certain amount of trying to get to the bottom of exactly what we were going to do that would be in the best interests of Australians for whom we are providing by way of superannuation and would give them the ability to resolve complaints, particularly medical complaints, that arose. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission in its evidence before us said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the assessment of medical evidence . . . is a highly complex function. It does not really rest easily with the tribunal type process, which is informal, economical and quick. It really rests better in a court type process where dealing with that type of disagreement. . . is well established.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator West said that if we disallowed this regulation we would have a backlog and an enormous number of medical complaints would be brought before the tribunal. Quite frankly, the evidence that we received suggests that that would not be the case. In the initial stages of our hearings I had some concerns that we would be opening a floodgate of complaints where the tribunal would be hard pressed to handle the number of cases that might come before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the evidence that has been presented to us suggests that that will not happen. We can use as an example the number of cases that have already been appealed to the Life Insurance Complaints Board. Disability constitutes roughly 10 per cent of the total number of complaints to that tribunal. To suggest that immediately allowing medical complaints to go before the tribunal will put an enormous workload on it is pure speculation. Nobody knows what the workload of that tribunal will be. The suggestion that our disallowing this regulation will somehow render the tribunal inoperative because it will be flooded with medical complaints should not concern us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather strange that the government is defending a process which would make all people who have concerns about medical complaints or medical appeals go before a court system. That is a far more expensive system than the one that is being proposed by the complaints tribunal. The coalition and the Australian Democrats are defending the rights of people who are quite often unemployed and people on low incomes to have a forum or a body that they can appeal to in order to have their dispute heard and resolved. I find that a little odd, but I guess in this committee various points of view have been expressed at times. I am glad to see that people are dealing with things on their merits rather than from any philosophical background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator West, the complaints involving medical evidence form a very small minority of disputes with regard to superannuation. The experience of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is that it has not resulted in a spate of appeals. The one thing that we should remember is that close to 50 per cent of the appeals that go to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are successful. So what should be kept in mind is not the number of complaints that go there but the fact that a considerable number of them are successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That factor ought to be taken into consideration in determining our attitude towards whether or not medical complaints can go to the tribunal. So, particularly, should the fact that disability claimants are normally unemployed and in a weak financial position and, therefore, ordinarily unable to take issue with adverse decisions that, in the end result, have a dramatic effect on the lives of the people involved. The cost to the community, superannuation funds and individuals of resolving disputes in a forum other than a court is very much lower than that of resolving them through a court procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons the coalition, after a fair bit of consideration, will be supporting the disallowance motion. Although we have tried to settle our disagreements this afternoon in a short time, in general terms, the idea of allowing six months is not unappealing to us; but, as I understand it, we cannot amend a regulation, and there is nothing wrong with the government putting in another regulation tomorrow setting out exactly the things that it is trying to amend in the current regulation. I understand that that is the case and stand to be corrected if I am wrong. If that is the case, I think that would be the sensible way to proceed because it would achieve the result that the government would choose to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is important to remember is that we were very concerned throughout the whole of these hearings about maintaining community confidence in the superannuation system. One of the things that has disturbed us as a committee in general is that a lot of the evidence we received would suggest that confidence in the superannuation system is currently on a downward trend rather than one of total support. In a period when people cite distrust of the system and distrust of legislative changes as one of the reasons behind this decline in confidence in superannuation, we really ought to take consumer confidence as a vital consideration in determining our position. Consumer confidence is one of the reasons why we believe that this regulation should be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could then see what comes by way of an amended regulation before the parliament, if the government so desires, and whether it comes in a form we feel we can support. I understand that Senator Woodley, in moving to disallow this regulation, is aware that we understand some of the difficulties that may arise. But, should a compromise regulation come into this place as early as possible, I am quite sure that Senator Woodley would be pleased, and I think that probably those of us on this side of the chamber would agree that that might be the way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few remarks, let me say that we will be supporting Senator Woodley's move to disallow the regulation. But we do hope that this matter can be resolved to the benefit of the superannuation system and those people who are affected by it adversely at times. I am thinking particularly of those people who, under our current system, have no forum other than the courts where they can redress any situation where they feel they have been treated less than fairly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a slightly more serious note, this issue highlights the problem of policy on the run. This debate is a shambles and if we proceed to pass Senator Woodley's motion today we will create a shambles in the superannuation complaints tribunal area. I hasten to add that I do not blame Senator Woodley for that; as always, he has been reasonableness itself. But we have got ourselves into the situation, partly due to the government being unable to respond quickly enough to the Senate committee report, where we have this debate coming on today when, with the goodwill that exists and a proper look at the situation, we could quite amicably resolve this issue within a few days and have a position that all parties could agree to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with Senator Woodley's proposition is that it has an impact tomorrow; it automatically adds the responsibility of hearing medical complaints to the super complaints tribunal tomorrow. Whatever else happens, whoever lodges a complaint or action tomorrow, whatever we do after that will have to be retrospective. It seems to me that as from tomorrow the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal can deal with complaints relating to medical issues that may go back many years. As a result of our actions today, if the motion proposed by Senator Woodley is passed, people could lodge those applications with the tribunal as from tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal has no staff for dealing with this situation, no procedures and no administrative mechanisms, and was not expecting to have this load placed upon it. The industry was not expecting to have to deal with this issue in this way either. We ought to draw back a bit and ask, `Is this good policy making by the Australian parliament?'. I accept that the fault is not on one side and that it is just a combination of events, but we ought to draw back and say, `This is not the way to create good policy; this is a way to create further complications.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson suggests that this will improve confidence in the superannuation system; I think it will have the exact opposite effect. Whatever we agree that we might want to do with a new regulation in the future, we will have to deal retrospectively with what we have done if we support Senator Woodley's motion&mdash;which is to say that people can take medical disputes to the super complaints tribunal today; but whatever we do tomorrow we will have to try to deal retrospectively with that or create a new class of people who have lodged their claims or what-have-you. That is plainly a bad position for this parliament to get itself into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not ignore the role played by the superannuation committee in this matter. We did reach a consensus position which tried to accommodate all the parties' interests. I think we did a reasonable job of that. The difficulty is that the government has had only a couple of hours to respond to the committee report. Like the other members of the committee, I am not convinced that there is not a role for the tribunal to play in dealing with medical complaints. I accept the view of industry that it has serious concerns about that, but I think they are not insurmountable and that we can work through them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also fair to say that we want to ensure that the super complaints tribunal is up and running, and working effectively before we go down this path, and if we support Senator Woodley's motion today, we will not give it that opportunity. The recommendation of the superannuation committee provided for that breathing space; it provided for the issues to be addressed systematically, with commonsense; and it provided for the parliament to come up with a solution which allowed for medical complaints to be dealt with at the tribunal after the tribunal had established itself and its role in the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be very careful about rejecting the advice and views of the relevant industry organisations. I am not one necessarily always to argue that LIFA and ASFA are right, but they had a clear expectation that medical disputes would not go before the tribunal. They have a strongly held view that that would impair the work of the tribunal and would not assist in developing confidence in the superannuation industry or in allowing the super complaints tribunal to establish itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party in particular has an obligation to think about that and to think about its position in relation to the very strongly held views of those industry groups. While I accept that one always has to examine whether or not people are speaking out of self-interest, I think it would be unfair to dismiss those industry claims purely on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that perhaps people have not explored this issue fully enough and that we are not fully conversant with all the issues of concern that have been raised or that industry groups may hold. That is not an excuse to rush into supporting Senator Woodley's motion today. The matter is capable of being resolved properly with the great deal of goodwill that exists within the sperannuation committee. I urge the Liberal Party to heed the warnings of the industry groups and not pass this motion today. I think it is creating more difficulties for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated to the opposition today that it is prepared to reconsider the issue in line with the committee's recommendations. I accept that it has been difficult to get that response quickly and that members opposite have not had enough time to deal with that issue and deal with the government's response, but I really think they ought to think about the haste with which we are dealing with this and whether or not this very blunt instrument of knocking out the regulation is the way to achieve the desired end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government's agreement to amend the regulation to create a provision in line with the committee's decision is sensible. It is saying to the committee that it will accede to its request and fully examine its report; that it will work through some of the outstanding issues, such as the relationship between trustees and insurance companies, that flow from decisions made by the tribunal, as well as the mechanisms that the tribunal will use to deal with complaints. These are important administrative and policy issues that have not yet been worked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the actions of the opposition parties, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal may have to handle complaints tomorrow. Some complaints may be longstanding ones. I do not have any in principle difficulty with those things going to the tribunal, but I do think we have to do this properly and methodically. We need to work through all those issues in a considered way, not by using this very blunt instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the opposition is in a very difficult position in relation to these issues, as is Senator Woodley. Senator Woodley is a very constructive politician, but we do not necessarily always get the opportunity to respond constructively. We have to use the mechanisms available to us. Senator Woodley is using the mechanism available to him, which is to knock out the regulation. But I think that the government has signalled its goodwill, given that the Labor senators on the committee supported the unanimous position and have indicated their willingness to support the general thrust of the committee's view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the government is now publicly putting its position that it would amend the regulation so that it has no effect after six months from today. The government can seek to amend that regulation, but if we support Senator Woodley's motion today and knock out the regulation, we are using a very blunt instrument that will impact severely on the operations of the tribunal. We will be rejecting all the best advice from the industry in relation to these matters and will be providing a very unsatisfactory solution to a problem that I think this parliament is capable of solving in a very constructive manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to think again. I urge the Senate not to disallow the regulation. I think the superannuation committee's report provides the basis for a solution and I think the government has indicated that it is prepared to work with the Senate towards finding that solution. At the very least, opposition and Democrat senators have the ability to seek to amend the legislation if they believe the government does not act in good faith from this point on, but I think this is the most clumsy, inappropriate way of trying to resolve this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this is being done with the best intentions, but I think we will regret it. I am very concerned about where it leaves us in trying to fix up the mess that we might create tonight. I am also concerned about the issues of retrospectivity, the administrative difficulties for the tribunal, the expectations it will create in people's minds and the next layer of confusion we will add to the superannuation industry by acting hastily tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to take very seriously the views of the industry groups. We do not necessarily have to agree with them&mdash;I do not necessarily agree with them&mdash;but I think we ought to manage the change program properly. Clearly, this is not the way. I think we need to ensure that proper administrative arrangements are put in place and that all the outstanding issues are addressed properly before just handballing what I think will be quite a large area of work to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I urge honourable senators to oppose the motion and support the regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable senators for the way in which they have engaged in this debate. I particularly thank government senators for the compliments they have sent my way. I wonder if it is not a case of Senator Chris Evans protesting too much by continually repeating that this is a blunt instrument. I point out to him that this disallowance motion has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for some months. I really am disappointed that the government has not been able to come to us with some solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West got to me when she said that we are choosing not to believe or trust the government members on the committee. That hurts. I would like to throw the compliment back and say that the government members of this committee have been very cooperative, made a lot of very helpful comments and engaged in committee debate in a very helpful way. However, I say to the government that it has to help us. We have proceeded down a certain track and have signalled what we would do. Really, the government has far more resources than the Democrats have to bring solutions and alternatives. I wonder whether on this matter the government has sat on its hands to a certain extent. We are giving the government a clean way of at least signalling the intention we have had all along of sticking up for the little people in this country and of giving consumers a way of getting to a place where they can have their problems heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the words I read earlier from the submission of Maurice Blackburn &amp; Co. That submission pointed out that one of the problems has been the superannuation funds themselves and the tardiness they have shown in finding solutions. A number of constituents have come to me in desperation. Not only have they not been able to access a hearing from the funds; they have not been able to get to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my constituents tried for four years to simply get from the superannuation fund to which he belonged what was his right: to find out the name of the trustee so that he could go to court. He was not able to access even that information. When I finally approached the superannuation fund and the particular life company in his name and said that I would probably raise the matter in the Senate, they suddenly became very cooperative. It seems that a little bit of coercion is sometimes enough to make life companies and superannuation funds actually do what they should have done for their members all along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government senators say to me that we really need to take account of what the funds and the companies are saying to us. I say to them that we need also to take account of what consumers are saying to us about the difficulties they have had, not just in accessing a tribunal but of even getting their cases heard in court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a problem. We are saying to the government, `Come back to us with a resolution. We're willing to listen. We're willing to accept a compromise.' But at this point the only way we can proceed is to press the disallowance motion we have moved tonight and to hope that, in having that passed, indeed the government will come back to us with some solutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reiterate where we are up to on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. The thrust of this bill is to extend the period of consideration of approved joint venture consortiums and approved trading house applications from 30 to 60 days; to limit the life of the approved joint venture consortiums to three years, with a discretion to extend the approval for subsequent three-year periods; to limit the maximum number of grants payable to any approved joint venture consortium, limiting grants payable to any AJVC to five; and to provide for ongoing review of the AJVC and the ATH, approved trading houses. It will tie the overseas visit allowance more directly to specific promotional activity and provide the power to establish an accreditation mechanism for the export market development grants consultants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: this is probably one of the most amended acts ever to come before this chamber. Since 1988 there have been eight amendments, including this one. It is probably no coincidence that this amendment follows hard on the heels of the Australian National Audit Office efficiency audit review into the effectiveness of the export market development grants scheme. That review revealed a number of deficiencies in the payment of grants to eligible applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, having regard to the consistent number of amendments since 1988, the parent legislation is in need of major surgery or being dismantled entirely and a completely new act developed in consultation with, firstly, its client base and, secondly, instrumentalities such as the ANAO, to ensure that such a new act is not subject to a regime of annual amendments. It would be better for everyone if such legislation was very clear and concise all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the National Party of Australia supports the intention embodied in the bill before us to provide a system of accreditation for consultants engaged by the private sector exporters and export businesses to assist in the preparation of their grant applications. Hopefully, this initiative will accelerate the backlog of claims that I understand currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention foreshadowed in this bill to more tightly focus on actual promotional activities overseas is also welcome. But again it must be said that this tightening up process is probably long overdue because, patently, grants have previously been made using wide criteria which are obviously inappropriate. I support the bill. I am quite sure, as Senator Hill started off by saying, that this bill will get a speedy passage through this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to speak on the Export Development Grants Amendment Bill, particularly as it impinges on the tourist industry. During question time last Tuesday, Senator McMullan waxed lyrical about how great the government's support for small to medium business operators was as shown by the EMDG scheme. However, when we look at the practical implications we see that this claim is nothing more than specious when it comes to tourism. In fact, it is a sham. The government's working nation statement, released in May of this year, states that the government would be:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . expanding the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme to provide export marketing assistance to single service tourism operators to recognise the significant contribution of the tourist industry to export growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that the tourist industry is probably one of our greatest industries if measured by foreign export earnings and employment. It has enormous potential yet it is only half recognised by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the change was introduced the tourist industry was only permitted to take 50 per cent of the grants that normally applied to other export industries and yet it is probably one of the greatest export earners in Australia today. The reason for the change, which I agree is a step in the right direction, was to enable small operators to be eligible for export market development grants along with other exporters. However, we must look at the way the government has treated the tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade's current position for existing claimants is that they will be paid no further grants if a facilitator or middleman is in the marketing chain. This technicality either fails to recognise the essential character of the tourist industry&mdash;in which a facility customarily employs a number of people in its marketing operation to reap both domestic and foreign markets&mdash;or it is a device to enable the government to neglect tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arcane administrative policy will inflict damage on the burgeoning theme park industry throughout Australia. Theme parks generate millions of dollars for the Australian economy both as an import replacement for Australians who travel domestically instead of overseas and as an export syringe into the international tourism market particularly of Asia. Most importantly, they also act as a trigger for Australian tourism in general. As an example which you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will appreciate, Sea World and Movie World bring in more than 80 per cent of all international tourists to the Gold Coast. That is an example of the dynamics of theme parks around Australia. However, all of this will be overlooked because these theme parks employ facilitators to promote their venue on an inbound and an outbound tourist basis&mdash;but more importantly from the inbound side, which represents the export part of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will particularly impact on those operators who quite sensibly join together to market regions&mdash;exhausting work in probably the most competitive industry in the world. Recently, I had the opportunity to travel in South-East Asia and in all of the very high growing market areas, such as Taiwan and Japan, I was informed by the wholesalers that those people market intensely to the benefit of Australian tourism. Everybody knows that this is the classic industry in international competitive markets. Really, the amount of output depends on the amount of input. So, if dollars are put into promoting tourism in Australia, the output will come through the additional tourists who will spend their money in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is denying those particular tourist operators the export market development grants which are so vital to them to persuade people overseas to visit Australia and to bring with them the export income which is so important to us. That is of particular interest today when we hear that our balance of payments deficit is running in the order of $1.8 billion for the month. If ever anything needed to be promoted it is an industry such as this which not only will improve our balance of payments but will also reduce the number of unemployed which, as everyone is aware, was brought about, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Punishing the attractions that draw the critical mass of tourists in the first place will ultimately extend to and damage the accommodation, service and restaurant industries. Indeed, it will punish every one of those single tourism operators that it is meant to help. As I said, the thing has all the appearances of a sham. The tourist who takes a taxi from the airport, checks into a hotel or resort, eats a meal at a restaurant and then goes shopping, is a tourist who, it is over 80 per cent likely, has visited in the first place because of a theme park&mdash;as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would be very well aware, living on the Gold Coast. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall my remarks about the export market development grants scheme in the context of the Australian National Audit Office report No. 33 of 1993-94 efficiency audit of the Australian scheme managed by Austrade to provide taxable cash grants to assist Australian exporters in developing export markets. The two major issues I highlighted then still remain: the need for improved accountability to parliament and the need for a greater measure of performance assessment. No substantial action has been taken on that issue. The audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there appears to be widespread support for the scheme the nature of the scheme has made direct measurement of effectiveness illusive. The lack of performance measures combined with Austrade's minimal annual reporting of its largest budget item leaves Parliament inadequately informed of the scheme's effectiveness given the high profile of the scheme and the frequency of legislative changes required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of performance measures is considered to be a function of the initial establishment of the scheme. If the scheme had been devised in such a way that its rationale was clearly stated so that its impact could be measured, considerable savings would have resulted from the ease with which the focus and impact of the scheme could have been monitored and regulated.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has been done in this regard. There is still no measure of the goal of this program, nor any system to assess its performance. Thus, we are going to get arguments such as we have had today as to whether the grant is a good thing or not, when in reality we are not doing any proper follow-up in terms of strict criteria assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program receives very substantial funding for private industry from public funds. The parliament, comprised of the elected representatives of the people who pay the taxes and levies that comprise those public funds, has the right to scrutinise the expenditure of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer report, and other reports, examine expenditure and performance on all services to ordinary people. Yet, government steadfastly refuses either to set transparent goals or to examine the performance of schemes that give money to industry for various purposes. In examining social services, the criterion is cost per person serviced with little regard for quality of service provided or ease of access to services. In not examining industry, apparently the giving of support&mdash;giving public money&mdash;is an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stated in the context of the export market development grants scheme that I hoped the government would consider implementing the recommendations of the report with respect to performance assessment and, at the same time, review the nature of the criteria used in that assessment. I also stated that there is a need for the inclusion of other criteria&mdash;those relating to the environmental impact of both production and products used for assistance under this scheme. There is also the issue of equity and the promotion of undesirable goods and habits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1994. I support the comments made by the other coalition speakers who have already contributed to the debate. As the other speakers have indicated, the amendments relate primarily to the management and control of approved joint ventures, consortia and approved trading houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst debating the bill before us, I want to take the opportunity to speak about the accessibility of grants under the export market development grants scheme for tourist operators. I want to do this because, as senators will be aware, I represent a very important tourist area of Australia; an area that is rapidly increasing in significance to the whole of Australia and particularly to our export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme was established for any Australian resident company, partnership or individual promoting goods or specified services. The tourist industry was eligible for grants under the scheme from 1978 to 1985, and then from 1985 to 1987 through a scheme parallel to EMDG called the TOPS program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the tourism industry was readmitted to the scheme, but in a limited way. Multi-service operators became eligible for grants but, to qualify, tourism operators had to supply at least three of the following services: transport of passengers by land, air or water; accommodation; tour escort services; or admission to a tourist attraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 May this year, after pressure from the industry, Minister Lee released a statement advising that all tourism operators could now access the export market development grants scheme, but there was a catch. Operators who did not provide three or more of the services mentioned could not access the scheme at the 50 per cent level enjoyed by operators in other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Single or dual tourism operators could only access the scheme at 25 per cent. A grant would only be given at half of the rate normally given under the export market development grants scheme. Grants would only be given for 25 per cent of a company's international promotional expenditure rather than the 50 per cent which everyone else received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from unfairness, the industry has expressed concern at the distortion that this gives in the provision of tourism services. Single and dual operators are now encouraged to move into other products to assess the scheme; products which would not normally be viable to them in their own particular businesses. The argument put forward by Austrade for this handicap is that all that Australian firms are doing is promoting their products in competition with other Australian suppliers. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. Anybody who understands the tourism industry knows that the promotion of a service overseas involves considerable promotion of the region where the service is located. The free benefits to the region from these promotions far outweigh any free promotion that multi-national tourism operators may receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns that using the number of services as a selection criterion for EMD grants is inappropriate. Some industry sources argue that selection criteria would be more appropriate if they involved some weighted measure of international tourist numbers and revenue&mdash;weighted so that small tourism operators were not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry also has concerns about the $30,000 promotional expenditure limit to access the scheme. The Far North Queensland Promotions Bureau, which is the primary representative body for tourism companies in the Cairns region, has a membership of 580 companies. Of those 580 companies, 80 per cent are small businesses with fewer than 20 employees while 40 to 50 per cent employ fewer than five people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses form a very important part of the tourism industry, particularly in far north Queensland. It is important that this $30,000 limit does not put the scheme out of reach of these businesses. Unfortunately, the legislation does not permit these small businesses in the tourism industry to form joint ventures and consortiums to develop overseas markets together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North Queensland Promotions Bureau itself has been unable to access the EMDG scheme because it does not have approved body status. Apparently, the Department of Trade prefers to grant approved body status to national rather than regional bodies. This is unfortunate, particularly in the instance I mentioned, because the Cairns bureau is very active and should be able to access support in the same way as national bodies. Having looked at the list of bodies approved under the Export Market Development Grant Act, I am concerned that the Far North Queensland Promotions Bureau has not been able to get into this scheme. There are many bodies on the list which have not been as active internationally as the Cairns promotion bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also problems with the lack of information about the scheme being channelled to north Queensland tourism operators. In an article which recently appeared in the local Cairns newspaper a Cairns financial consultant was reported as saying that more than half the local businesses entitled to make a claim under the EMDG scheme had not made a claim because of lack of know-how. The consultant also referred to industry concerns that the process of applying for a grant was too hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry sources in Cairns have told me that it is not worth their while to apply for a grant because of the time and money associated with the process. It is not worth $15,000 in accounting fees to get a grant of about $12,000. The application forms, formulae and regulations are complicated. Financial people have advised me that the documentation requirements for the EMDG application are far more stringent than for a tax audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the definition of tourism services which can access the scheme is unclear. Although the legislation is not yet before the parliament, it seems that casinos, convention centres, restaurants and hire car services are not able to access the scheme and will not be included under that definition. However, any Canberra bureaucrat who came up to Cairns and Townsville and said that these sectors were not exporters in the tourism industry would be laughed out of town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, $38 million is being invested in a convention centre in Cairns which is hoping to get more than 50 per cent of its business internationally. The convention centre will be developing and promoting a wide range of international packages in conjunction with local hotels, tour and cruise companies, restaurants and tourist attractions. The convention centre's expenditure on international promotions will be immense. The economic and trade benefits to Cairns and to Australia of this convention centre are obvious. It is likely that the Cairns casino will be in much the same situation. Yet the export market development grants scheme does not seem to apply to those sorts of businesses as it is flagged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the scheme has a lot of problems in its present form but, as I said, the government has not yet drafted legislation in relation to this aspect. It is of some concern to the industry that legislation is so long in coming. It is important that these problems are quickly solved and that legislation entailing changes regarding the tourism industry is brought before the parliament for debate at the earliest possible time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I hope the minister takes these matters into account at this time. Although not directly related to the bill, these things relate to the scheme. I hope that the minister will be able to take them into account when drafting the next piece of legislation so that Australian tourist operators, who are such an important part of our export earnings drive, can be properly and fairly catered for in this scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats do not support clauses 6 and 7 of the bill. As I partly foreshadowed during the debate on the second reading, there are extremely compelling grounds for those clauses not being supported by the opposition and the government. Heaven only knows where the opposition gets its advice. It no longer seems to be concerned for small business; obviously, the government is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly summarise something that has been on the table for a number of days. These sections knock back from eight to five the number of grants that a consortium may obtain. The argument put forward is that large firms, which are able to obtain a grant in their own right, are double-dipping. That is, they get up to eight grants, which is the current limit, as a consortium and then get another eight grants in their own right because they are big enough to get sufficient expenditure together to claim the 50 per cent contribution from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not told the big boys that whatever grant they get, be it as a consortium or individual firm, would be counted as a grant so that they could not double-dip and would have to accept eight grants as a maximum. Instead, it has knocked back from eight to five the number of grants that small businesses can get through a consortium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the government's own reasoning, big companies will still be able to get 13 grants&mdash;eight plus five&mdash;while small companies will be knocked back to five grants. That is the logic of it and the Democrats have put that in writing to everyone. In two and a half pages of finely detailed argument we have said what the effects of this particular provision are. We have asked that account be taken of the damage this is doing to small business without achieving the government's particular objective. We are told that five grants should be sufficient. That is a non sequitur. It means nothing as far as the government's objective with this particular amendment is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is to make the decision as to whether they should apply for five or eight? The act as it stands enables people to get eight grants. All of a sudden they are to be limited to five, because five might be enough. What about the eight for large firms? Should that not be knocked back too, if five is enough? Why does small business once again get it in the neck?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really find it difficult to understand why this very straightforward calculation has not been taken into account when it has been pointed out to and considered by the government and the opposition. Why do they not look at the effect of this provision in the bill? On one occasion we were told, `Yes, you have got a point. But, really, we cannot go against the advice of the department.' What sort of answer is that? Is the government politically responsible to the community, to small business? Are government members parliamentary representatives elected to simply do the bidding of the departmental officers or are they elected to look after the interests of their constituents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument placed before us was that small firms also could join a number of consortia. But what we are talking about is the relative difficulty that applicants experience, whether they be small business people or large companies. It is clear from the record, on the government's own reasoning, that large companies can double dip. To put it plainly, they can rort the system. Why do we not put any restrictions on them? Why do we say that small companies could join a number of consortia and can get it that way? Why do we make the distinction? Why do we knock back consortia to five grants and allow large companies to go for eight grants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have made the issue quite clear to the committee. At this late stage, I hope that if the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has any concern for small business at all, he will see the light of day, will see the compelling logic of the argument I am putting, and will support our opposition to clauses 6 and 7. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I explained to Senator Spindler, we will not be supporting the Democrats opposition to clauses 6 and 7. It is simply a question of making a judgment, as Senator Spindler says quite correctly, about what is fair. The joint venture provisions, it should be said, give companies additional access to the EMDG scheme. We would expect that after five years companies would have had time to develop the capacity to claim as individual claimants. I notice that Senator Spindler was not arguing with that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give companies a potential 16 years in the scheme through the operation of the joint venture provisions is, in our view, excessive. Members, as Senator Spindler is aware, can receive eight grants in their own right, separate from the grants received as a party to the AJVCs, and there is currently no limit to the number of which a legal person can be a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $30,000 per annum is considered to be the effective minimum expenditure platform for successful take-off into export. On this basis, the current criteria is generous in allowing the membership to pool expenditure to obtain the $30,000. AJVCs are project focused. Grants provided under the general provisions of the scheme are global. Five years is considered to be generous support for a specific project and a more than adequate basis preparatory to an individual firm commencing promotion in its own right, which, of course, is the ultimate purpose of the scheme, as Senator Spindler knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a concern about the dropout rate. If AJVCs are not linked to export development by limiting the number of grants available, it means that companies with little long-term export prospects and which contribute little to the overall success of the scheme can receive eight grants and drop out of the scheme. AJVCs are not limited to small firms. Senator Spindler has concentrated on the small firm side, but they are not limited to small firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not considered appropriate that the scheme provide assistance to larger firms for eight years per project. Large firms are given access to the scheme to piggy-back smaller firms. If access were to be limited to small firms, the definition would be controversial and the administrative burden on Austrade would be considerable. But the bottom line of the government's position on this is a question of making the scheme as valuable to the people involved in it as the budget allocations for these schemes allow, which of necessity must be limited. I know that is not a problem for the Democrats but it is a problem for any government. One has to get the best bang for the buck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that five years is a generous allocation, giving a company time to develop a capacity to claim as an individual claimant. We believe that to give companies a potential, as I said, for 16 years in the scheme through the operation of the joint venture provisions is excessive, which is why we cannot support the Democrats' opposition to the clauses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This bill, introduced into the Senate on 5 May this year, amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 as well as the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993&mdash;two acts which were passed by the Senate on 17 November as part of the SIS package and which received royal assent on 30 November 1993. The amendments are minor and largely of a housekeeping nature. When we are addressing avant-garde threshold issues, as the SIS legislation does, it is inevitable that some finetuning will be required over time as problems with its practical operation come to light.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task at hand in drafting the act and its companions which form this package was indeed a mammoth one. I am pleased that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was able to carry out its oversighting role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SIS package has the complex objective of increasing the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry, strengthening the security of superannuation savings and increasing the protection and rights of superannuation fund members. Of course, honourable senators may recall a debate earlier this afternoon which was all about protecting the rights of superannuation fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the bill that is before us reflect the willingness of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to listen to the concerns of those in the superannuation industry. I commend the speed with which the ISC generally responds to the issues as they arise. The damage control system which the ISC has adopted does work reasonably effectively and efficiently for superannuation funds and their members. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has a good working relationship with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Indeed, I look forward to an ongoing and fruitful relationship in improving Australia's superannuation regime for the benefit of all Australians&mdash;despite a little hiccup this afternoon when, as a result of our action, we may have caused it to burn the midnight oil for the next week or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed a privilege to chair the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It is a continuing committee and it plays a central role in the superannuation arena by acting as a forum for the discussion of issues. I must commend the actions of all my colleagues from the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats for the very constructive way that they look at issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent months the committee has been conducting an inquiry into the SIS regulations which supplement the provisions of the SIS Act. The committee has received 25 submissions and held two public hearings. The first part of its report on the regulations was tabled today. Again, the amendments to those regulations reflect the flexibility of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and its commitment to listening to industry and consumer concerns. I commend the government and the ISC for listening and acting. I trust that the government will act with some expedition in relation to the issue that we discussed earlier this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall start my discussion of this bill with the amendment to section 66 of the act&mdash;originally clause 62. The government's amendment seeks to clarify that excluded superannuation funds may acquire only the business real property of members or their relatives where it forms part of the member's or relative's principal business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments relating to equal representation are warmly welcomed. The age of equitable representation and responsible decision making is dawning on the superannuation industry. Equal representation is one of the many new protective checks on trustee decision making processes introduced under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, known as OSSA, and built upon in the SIS legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to sections 91, 92 and 93 of the SIS Act will allow standard employer sponsored funds, which are public offer funds, to either have an independent trustee or comply with basic equal representation rules. Currently, the management of those funds is restricted to independent trustees. Employee representatives are not, as the name might suggest, necessarily members of the superannuation fund. They are representatives nominated by the members of the fund, a trade union or other organisation representing the interests of those members. There is much merit in having employee trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate might recall that, on 17 November last year, I moved a series of amendments which sought to require that at least one member representative be a member of the fund&mdash;that is, a representative from the shop floor. That amendment, unfortunately, was not supported. Despite that opposition, I call upon the government to give this matter further serious consideration, since I believe there is no better auditor of a superannuation fund than a fund member off the shop floor. I believe this would add a significant dimension to the prudential security to the administration of superannuation funds in Australia. This is an appropriate opportunity to remind the Senate of that call I made some time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equal representation amendments made by the bill will undoubtedly provide funds with much greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship and ensure that members are protected by having a trustee who is independent and by having direct involvement in the fund via equal representation. Again, I believe this could be enhanced further by having a shop floor representative. I will not press the case by way of amendment but again I ask the ISC and the government to consider this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of other amendments to the SIS Act which I will touch on only briefly because of the time. The disclosure rules will be amended to allow the minister to approve public disclosure of information where this is in the public interest and does not unreasonably disclose the personal affairs of an individual. The government's amendments introduced today will also extend the circumstances in which protected information may be disclosed. The ISC is currently able to disclose information to the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities Commission. Those amendments will allow the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to become a recipient of information obtained by the ISC. The effective operation of the tribunal, which commenced only two months ago, can only be improved by these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that I believe there is scope for the legislation to be improved further, I call upon the government for an assurance that this will take place. The interests of fund members who make complaints to the tribunal will be protected if the ISC is required to obtain an authorisation to release personal information to the tribunal. Whilst the secrecy provisions provide checks on the circumstances in which the information can be disclosed, the mechanisms which I have just suggested would provide a further protective measure and I believe are worth consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New clause 60A should act to reinforce the perceived and intended real independence of trustees by requiring that the governing rules of public offer funds allow a trustee to be removed only by the commissioner, unless the removal is of a kind to be specified in the regulations. On the other hand, the amendment to clause 363 of the SIS Act, which allows trustees to retire without calling a meeting of beneficiaries, is a commonsense measure. It will eliminate unnecessary expense to superannuation funds where an existing trustee retires as a result of the SIS Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a number of measures relate to investment standards. The first of these measures will amend section 71 to treat deposits in non-bank financial institutions, which are subject to prudential supervision, in the same way as deposits in an approved bank for the purpose of determining whether the deposits are in-house assets. The effect of this is significant as the SIS Act restricts the in-house assets of regulated superannuation funds to 10 per cent of the total assets in most cases. What it does is bring in the non-bank institutions such as building societies et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 20 makes a change to the investment at arms-length basis rule in section 109. The bill allows a non-arms-length transaction so long as the terms and conditions are no more favourable than those reasonably expected of an arms-length dealing&mdash;again, another sensible resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes important changes to the custodian provisions. Custodians play an important role in safeguarding the assets under a contract with a trustee or investment manager. New clause 126A will prevent disqualified persons from becoming or acting as custodians of superannuation entities. This parallels provisions already in place for the appointment of trustees and investment managers. It is even more important that these sorts of prudential controls extend to custodians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments introduced by the government that allow exempt public sector funds to become subject to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act I believe will also be welcomed. They increase the accessibility of the tribunal by public sector fund members and ensure that those funds that elect to become subject to the SIS act have an internal resolution mechanism. This later amendment rectifies a problem that has come to my attention. Previously, if a fund did not have an internal resolution mechanism a member could not go to the tribunal. It was not surprising that I expressed concern when I heard from the consumer association this afternoon that there were some hints that the government may be excising or exempting life companies from the complaints tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having now covered most of the measures in this bill, I shall take the opportunity to raise a few topical issues in relation to superannuation generally. In particular, I want to draw to the Senate's attention the taxation changes to superannuation which were overlooked by many in the flurry of activity to meet the deadlines for conformity with the new regulations imposed under the SIS regulations. As senators know, from 1 July there were a number of changes to the taxation treatment of benefits and limits on both reasonable benefits and deductible contributions. These changes were announced in the Treasurer's security in retirement statement of 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be useful in this debate to draw attention to some of the changes. Firstly, fixed dollar limits will apply to lump sums&mdash;$400,000&mdash;and pensions. These amounts will be indexed each July at the rate of change in average weekly ordinary-time earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the maximum deductions for superannuation available to employees will be $9,000 for members aged less than 35, $25,000 for members aged between 35 and 49 and $62,000 for members aged 50 or more. Thirdly, the death benefit will be subject to the RBL testing and will be tested against the deceased's pension RBL, regardless of whether the benefit is paid in a lump sum or pension form. Any benefit above the deceased's pension RBL will be treated as an excess benefit and the tax rate then will be 48.4 per cent. However, where the benefit paid to a spouse or dependent child is less than the deceased's RBL, it will be tax free. Bona fide redundancy and approved early retirement schemes will no longer receive any concessional tax treatment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in relation to the recent report by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force. Firstly, I wish to place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat for their hard work on this most complex issue. I also wish to thank my fellow senators on that committee for the valuable contributions they made during the course of this inquiry. Also, I do not think I could overlook the openness with which the navy approached this inquiry and the complete assistance and cooperation it gave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the terms of reference was to investigate allegations of sexual harassment and various other matters on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>. These allegations arose out of incidents which occurred during a tour of duty in 1992. The most notorious allegation was that of a sexual assault on the ship's doctor by a fellow officer. As the incident took place overseas, civil authorities did not have jurisdiction and, therefore, a court martial ensued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee investigated the handling of the matter by the navy and also whether the court martial was an appropriate course of action to take. The committee found no impropriety in the way that investigations were handled. However, in hindsight, in such a process there would have been much to gain from input of experienced civilian police officers. Of course, the court martial was held and the officer concerned was acquitted. It was at the conclusion of this that a board of inquiry was conducted by the navy into wide ranging matters dealing with the crew's behaviour on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At all stages the ship's doctor, who made the complaint that I previously mentioned, was provided with top level legal representation by the navy. The bill for this has exceeded $100,000, and I believe that that is a most important point to bear in mind in the way that the navy has behaved throughout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first witness at the board of inquiry was Captain Mole from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>. He was given a matter of some hour's notice and, in the absence of appropriate advice as to what might befall him, initially declined legal representation. I believe that in the circumstances Captain Mole's case might not have been put as adequately as it otherwise might have been. In relation to the situation regarding Captain Mole, the committee recommended a review of his censure&mdash;and I note that comments have been made in relation to this by my friend Senator Teague, who was on the committee, and Senator Macdonald; I support those remarks wholeheartedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the inquiry, it became apparent that the integration of women into the navy was, indeed, a quantum leap in policy. Perhaps it was not accompanied by the preparation that one would expect in relation to such a leap forward. In recent years the navy has taken positive steps to address any problems of sexual harassment. Firstly, a 008 help line has been provided to take care of any confidential calls. Anyone who feels aggrieved by any inappropriate behaviour can make use of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the navy has implemented a good working relationship program dealing with issues such as gender bias and sexual harassment. The committee experienced this program first-hand, and I compliment the navy on its implementation. In fact, the other services in the ADF could do well to follow such a program. I note that the navy implemented this program after obtaining detailed advice from a private consultant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this whole affair serves as a lesson not just to the ADF as to sexual harassment generally but to the wider community and employers at large. Sexual harassment is indeed a serious matter: it is serious to the person who is being harassed; it is serious to the employer because it directly affects performance in employment and could well affect production; and in the navy, of course, it goes directly to team spirit and morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst looking at the question of sexual harassment, the committee had cause to look at the Sexual Discrimination Act. There is an aspect of confusion, I believe, in relation to what constitutes `sexual harassment'. The act was introduced in 1984 and was subsequently amended in 1992. Section 28(3) involves a somewhat subjective test whereby a person concerned has to anticipate, to some extent, that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by that behaviour. In other words, we have to put ourselves in the place of the other person and anticipate whether they will feel in some way harassed. That, of course, is indeed a subjective test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman might walk past a building site and a labourer on that site might give her a wolf whistle. Of course, the woman concerned might be somewhat sensitive to that and feel somewhat intimidated. But some women, on the other hand, might feel that it is a compliment. I believe that this aspect needs to be looked at. I do not believe the section as it stands is as clear as it could be and I believe that, during the course of the inquiry, this aspect came to the fore. If the matter is to be clarified, a good starting point would be an amendment of the section to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The navy, unlike most employers, has indeed a difficult workplace to administer. The committee spent a day on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>. It is a destroyer escort; it is not a large ship, by any standards, and has cramped conditions. Both male and female personnel have to work under these conditions. One aspect that came to light was that the boiler room was extremely noisy, very hot and very cramped. The navy has a `no touch' rule. What exercised our minds was how the navy could run such a rule by the book in such cramped quarters where, to make ourselves heard by other crew members, we virtually had to stand right next to them and yell into their ears. It became apparent during the hearing that this was a common practice and, whilst the ship was in a heaving ocean, one could well imagine that the `no touch' rule could quite innocently be breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I compliment the navy on its attempts to deal with such a difficult environment. It concedes that sexual harassment is a very important matter to be addressed, and it was one that the committee made various recommendations on. In fact, the committee made some 40 recommendations on this aspect. It recommended that the navy provide even more training to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations that I found particularly attractive was that more emphasis should be placed on trying to resolve sexual harassment allegations at an informal level between the parties concerned. This is well before considering the option of tribunals or lawyers or running into lengthy cases which might entail compensation. Having said that, I do not downplay the effect that sexual harassment could have on the individual and the workplace. But I do believe that, as a starting point, that is a commonsense approach. During the course of this inquiry, I believe that the committee came to that view as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate. I believe that it is a report which will serve the Senate, the parliament and this country for some years to come and could be looked upon as somewhat of a beacon in relation to the treatment of sexual harassment in the workplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to raise some serious concerns about Telecom&mdash;the quality of its network, but most importantly its corporate culture. I hope to table a number of documents to illustrate my concerns. The catalyst for this speech is the absolutely bizarre experience which a Ballarat man by the name of Mr Robert Bray has just been put through by Telecom, an experience in which Mr Bray's perfectly civilised request to have a phone put on resulted in his name being referred to a local hospital for psychiatric treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bray has supplied a statement to me. It states that he recently moved to Ballarat and asked Telecom to connect a silent line. Telecom did so, but the phone service was faulty and Mr Bray reported that fact to Telecom the day it was connected. That night, Mr Bray had a long phone conversation with a Mr Allan Harris of Melbourne during which they discussed their personal experiences as victims of child abuse. The following morning, a Telecom employee rang to tell Mr Bray that his phone calls were being taped and broadcast in Ballarat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bray again complained to Telecom. Four days later, he was rung by a community psychiatric nurse from Ballarat's Lakeside Hospital. The nurse told Mr Bray that he had been referred to the hospital by Telecom because he had complained that his phone calls had been taped and also that Telecom had made similar referrals previously. Subsequently, the Telecom manager who had contacted the hospital visited Mr Bray and, in Mr Bray's words, apologised overwhelmingly. The manager said that he was concerned that Mr Bray may have been an ex-mental patient. Subsequent to that, pornographic literature was dumped on Mr Bray's back doorstep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bray's proof of evidence states that he gave no permission to Telecom to monitor or tape his telephone calls, to refer him for psychiatric treatment, to give out his name, to give out his address or to give out his silent telephone number. He has made a complaint to the Australian Federal Police, who do appear to have made a quick and a thorough investigation of this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, we were offered an explanation of this incident by Telecom. It states that there was no customer recording equipment in Ballarat which would have allowed the taping of the conversations between Mr Bray and Mr Harris. However, we do understand that phone calls can be monitored in any exchange and they can in any exchange be broadcast on an internal loudspeaker. All that would be required to record telephone conversations is a portable cassette player in this case. We make absolutely no claim that this has happened. We have no idea whether or not this happened in this case, but it is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom also said that Mr Bray's number was not silent for the first three days and could have been given out to someone who had a grudge against him, who then rang pretending to be a Telecom employee. On the evidence we have seen that seems most unlikely. As far as we can tell, phone numbers are not normally available for two or three days after connection. Mr Bray's number is listed on his account as being silent after three days, which fits in with that. Telecom also told us that the Telecom manager had contacted the hospital because he was concerned for the safety of his employees, but a Telecom employee had been at Mr Bray's residence the day before and had suffered no ill effects, and was even offered a cup of tea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that this case raises serious concerns. Some of them are specific to Mr Bray and Mr Harris. If their conversations were monitored&mdash;we believe Telecom has a clear case to answer on this point&mdash;then their privacy has been grossly violated. But the fact that Mr Bray was referred for psychiatric treatment is not disputed and is simply outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we ask is: were Mr Bray's experiences the product of unique circumstances or are they are symptom of a wider malaise within Telecom? There is little doubt that Mr Bray's privacy has been grossly violated, whether or not his calls were monitored. In this he is not alone. The experience of Telecom customers whom we know have had their phone calls taped without their knowledge suggests a willingness to invade the privacy of people who make serious complaints against Telecom. Indeed, one of the documents I hope to table shows that information obtained through the monitoring of Brisbane's Tivoli restaurant was passed on to a legal firm representing Telecom in its dispute with that restaurant. To us, this smacks of industrial espionage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well aware that the Australian Federal Police are investigating allegations of phone monitoring and taping, and everything that we have heard suggests that it has been very thorough. We do not presume to know what it has found, but the length of its investigations suggests that the problem of illegal monitoring and taping is not a small one. We urge the government to release its findings as soon as it is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another lesson we can draw from Mr Bray's experience is Telecom's persistent habit of blaming the victim. Mr Bray made a legitimate complaint and was assumed to be mentally ill. This is an obviously extreme episode, but it is not unusual for people who make unusual complaints, particularly about persistent faults, to be told that there is no fault. In effect, they are told it is in their imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Telecom offered us an explanation which does not stand up to close examination has been par for the course. Frankly, we are sick of it. We are sick of being offered briefings designed to show Telecom in the best possible light in the hope that we do not spot the inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These documents are full of examples which show how that has happened. During our many briefings on the casualties of Telecom, we were frequently given to believe that Telecom's network achieved a 98 per cent call completion rate, making the CoT complaint of persistent faults somewhat incredible. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act and other documents that we hope to table will show that Telecom is in fact looking at the moment at a call completion rate of around 90.2 per cent rate. This means that one call out of 10 probably will not go through. Telecom is happy with that. That is just not good enough. These documents show that people inside Telecom also believe that that is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things shown in these documents. I also want to table the letter we have written to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), delivered today, asking for him to take certain actions on certain things about Telecom. I do not want to take any further action until we have that answer from the minister. I look forward to that answer and I look forward to discussing it with other members of the Senate. In the meantime, I seek leave to table these documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me tonight I wish to outline why I believe we should move in Australia to an Australian head of state. Many describe Australia as in transition, in these last few years of the decade, between a monarchy that has served us very well in the past and a republic. I strongly believe that we should have constitutional change that would see an Australian head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our national symbols are very important. We are an independent nation&mdash;a country that has its own independence, its own sovereignty, its own integrity&mdash;and our national symbols should reflect that independence. Accordingly, I think it is quite inappropriate that Australia has a foreigner as head of state, a person who is not a citizen of Australia and who has prior allegiance to the United Kingdom and a range of allegiances to some 12 or 14 other countries. I believe that the time has come for an Australian citizen to be the head of state of Australia and for that person to have no other allegiances but to Australia. In that way, our national symbol, vested in the head of state, will be directly reflecting our independence and sovereignty as the Australian nation. </PARA>

The second reason is that the current head of state of Australia has built within it as an institution a gender bias. If the Queen of Australia had a younger brother he would be now the king of Australia. I believe it is unacceptable in the 1990s to have such a symbol in the head of state no longer reflecting the values of Australia. In fact, we have in Australian law a ban on gender bias for the determining of any official, except one. That one official is the head of state. We should now remedy that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is that a religious test for the head of state is no longer to be tolerated. Currently, the head of state of Australia must be a member of my church, the Anglican Church. I have no worries about persons being relaxed as a member of my particular part of the Christian church, but it is abhorrent to me that there is not freedom of conscience or freedom of religion in the position of head of state of Australia. If the Queen were to become a Catholic, she would be out of a job. If the Queen were to become a member of some other religion, she would be out of a job. It is against section 116 of the constitution that this should be a restriction placed on any official of the Commonwealth of Australia. It applies to only one person&mdash;the head of state. We must remedy that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose that the head of state be called the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. Although I do not step back from advocating a change to a republic, if that is the word popularly used in the media or by the public, I do not see any necessity for using the word `president' or the word `republic'. I advocate that the head of state of Australia&mdash;an Australian citizen&mdash;be called the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. If I had more time, I would elaborate on that. But, in substance, I respect these terms. They have rich meaning for us in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the head of state having the same formal powers as the Governor-General's powers set out in the constitution. This also includes the same responsibilities and, indeed, the same conventions around the constitution determining the decisions of the Governor-General. With the omission of references to the monarch and the Crown in the constitution of Australia, there would need to be a universal use of the term `Governor-General-in-Council' for the responsibilities of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not advocate, rather I resist, any change to the political structure of Australia. It has developed well in an evolutionary way and we now have one of the best democracies in the world. I do not wish to see any change to the powers of the Senate or of the states. If anything, speaking subjectively, I would like to see the powers of the Senate and the states enhanced. I am not advocating any change to the political structure of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of state should be nominated by the elected Australian government, as it is now, and be appointed by the Australian parliament. This should be by joint sitting, as this is a usual occurrence at the beginning of any sitting of the parliament and whenever the Governor-General comes to address the parliament. I have advocated that the appointment be made by a simple majority in a joint sitting, but I could be persuaded that it be by a two-thirds majority. Certainly, I agree with the aspirations of those who have advocated a two-thirds majority. The only reason I put forward a simple majority is that it is closer to the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to state governors, it is clear that this is for the states to determine. As a federal parliamentarian, I do not wish to interfere. But, clearly, by a similar procedure they could determine that the governor of each state be nominated by the state government and elected by a joint  sitting of the state parliament. The state governors could have the same powers as they have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not advocate any change to our other national symbols because there is no reason to put forward any change to the flag, to the crest, to the flower, or to the anthem. I support the Australian flag. I support the Australian crest, with its kangaroo and emu, and the state shields. I support the flower of Australia, the wattle, which is about to blossom, especially on 1 September, and is already alive on all our hillsides and gardens. I support the anthem of Australia, which we have heard so often at the Commonwealth Games during these last two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that we will be best served by any presidential system along the lines of the United States of America or other constitutions of that kind anywhere in the world. We are a unique Australian system of government that is, in part, built upon the Westminster system in which ministers are parliamentarians and where the executive is drawn from the legislature and responsible to it. I do not propose any change to that system. Of course, we are enriched by more than just the Westminster system. We have a referenda system from Switzerland. We have a federation. We have an elected upper house. We have many features in our constitution which are not in any way derived from the Westminster system. But, essentially, we are rightly described as a Westminster style of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not have a popular election for the head of state because that would mean the position is contested in a party-political way&mdash;a way which would be unnecessarily divisive in Australia. I would like to see, the position of Governor-General being a symbol of unity, as it is now&mdash;not having a separate power base or a political base that is in any way challenging to the elected government of the day, but exercising clear powers under the constitution and the conventions surrounding the constitution that define the head of state's responsibilities. At the moment, the public seems to favour a popularly elected president, but over the coming months there must be increased dialogue to show the implications of that. If the people could see that it would mean party politicising and an ineligibility of the best candidates, they would accept the status quo. I seek to continue my remarks on Wednesday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak for a few moments on the fact that very shortly, from 3 September to 10 September, we will be celebrating once again White Ribbon Week. I think honourable senators would remember that last year many of us wore white ribbons to show our commitment to ending men's violence in the family. It is very appropriate in this year that we should underline this issue. The week coincides with Fathers' Day. Fathers' Day is a time when we all focus on our families and particularly on our fathers. Therefore, White Ribbon Week is a great opportunity for men to take responsibility for ending men's violence in the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through White Ribbon Week, all men are encouraged to show their concerns about the level of male violence in our society. Wearing a white ribbon allows men to make a personal and public statement about that. There will be marches and rallies around Australia on Saturday, 3 September, to show  concern for violence in the family. Marches will be organised in all mainland capital cities. We expect thousands of men to take part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem in Australian society. I do not think any of us would want to deny that. If it were between countries, we would call it war. If it were a disease, we would call it an epidemic. If it were an oil spill, we would call it a disaster. But it is happening to women, and it is just an everyday affair. It is men's violence against women. Forty-two per cent of all female murder victims in Australia in 1990-91 were killed by their husbands. One in 10 families experience chronic domestic violence. One in four girls are sexually assaulted before the age of 18, usually by a family member. Women have a one in three chance of being raped. In 80 per cent of rape cases, the women know their attackers. In more than 95 per cent of all these cases, the offenders&mdash;sad to say&mdash;are men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They come from all social backgrounds&mdash;men in business suits, men in blue collars, men who work on the land, men who work in offices; not weirdos, just ordinary men. This week is an awareness week when men are encouraged to take a stand against men's violence&mdash;the one thing we can take a stand against&mdash;and to challenge the community's acceptance that somehow or other violent behaviour is acceptable. White Ribbon Week will give us an opportunity to make this personal statement, to break the silence about the violence perpetrated against women and to challenge society's widespread acceptance of violence&mdash;to encourage men to take responsibility for their own behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a choice that we have to make. We do not have to condone violent behaviour on our own behalf or on behalf of our colleagues. We encourage individuals and organisations to become involved in White Ribbon Week by distributing ribbons and speaking about the issue. During the week, volunteers around Australia will sell ribbons for $2 each. The money raised will go directly to women's groups and services and to establish ongoing community education programs to help end men's violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white ribbon campaign hopes to take this work into schools, workplaces, prisons, clubs and associations, places of worship and trade unions. In the International Year of the Family the biggest threat to the family is indeed men's violence. Men collectively must take responsibility for ending this form of violence. White Ribbon Week is a great start to this process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising, I thank Senator Woodley for accommodating my opportunity to speak on the adjournment tonight. I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a great friend, a mentor and a coach who took his own life a couple of weeks ago and whom I hold very dear. He was a German friend of mine by the name of Johannes Gerke. He was, I think it is fair to say, from the generation of competitors that preceded mine in the skeleton or one-man bobsled event; and Hannes, as he was fondly known, was concluding his sporting career as I was commencing mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember very clearly seeing Hannes sliding in my first race at Innsbruck, and seeing the very beautiful way in which he was able to slide the track because he was so focused and had a tremendous understanding of what it took to be a good competitor. But he also had something else: the ability to be focused but incredibly calm about the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember being terribly excited at my first race, trying very hard to get quickly down the track, and Hannes taking me aside and saying to me in German something which translates as, `Don't think about what you're going to do. Just slide the race.' He was saying that, if one works too hard at steering the sled, the sled will not go very quickly because one is fighting it and, as much as possible, one wants to work the sled smoothly down the track. Hannes's advice was also good mental advice because he was saying that, if one has all these other thoughts in one's mind, one will not be able to slide the track properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Hannes's last season the year that I began because he had injured his back and was not able to slide. But for every season that followed that, he would always turn up for the races, for the world cup and for the world championship. He travelled to Canada and to the US. He was a very popular figure on the circuit and he was a friend to every man that slid world cup and world championship. Everybody has a very high regard for Johannes Gerke as a man, a competitor, a friend, a drinking buddy and, as I have, a coach and mentor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Johannes was very fond of his home track of Winterberg in Germany. He would always come to the races armed with a host of photos from the previous season, some sponsor's T-shirts or stickers from the Winterberg track, and always have a couple of words of good advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier on this year he injured himself in an accident with a truck and was incapable of working. That did not mean that Hannes was penniless or anything like that, because he was on full compensation; but it very much upset him, because his life, really, was about sport, work and socialising. So he found that he could not compete in sport and he could not work. Not long after, he lost his licence for driving under the influence of alcohol. I believe that the depression which followed from all of these things was the cause of Hannes taking his life by hanging himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing will bring him back and, I suppose, it was his decision. However selfish it may be of us to want to have him with us, he had a right to make that decision, I suppose, in some ways. He must have felt that he had every reason on earth to do it. All I can say,</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, for my part and as far as my friends are concerned, is that we will miss Hannes. We will love him. We will always think of him and, more importantly, we will always think of the great kindness and friendship he showed to all of us. That, I think, will have to carry us through next season and the seasons to come. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The precise details of the land dealing in question are not known to the Government. The sale of the land is understood to have taken place in April 1994 on the basis of public consultation, however there was apparently no direct consultation with Aboriginal people. The sale took place after the lodgment with the National Native Title Tribunal of a native title claim over the area by the Yawuru people, but before this application was accepted by the Tribunal and registered on 26 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Native Title Act 1993 (the Native Title Act) places restrictions on the doing of acts affecting native title. It provides that non-legislative acts occurring after 1 January 1994 may validly affect native title only if they meet the requirements of the "permissible future act" test contained in the Native Title Act. In the case of onshore places, a permissible future act is one that can be done over ordinary title land (which in the case of Western Australia is freehold land). The Native Title Act provides that any future acts which do not permit the permissible future act test are invalid. Aboriginal people who consider that an act which affects their native title is or will be invalid under the Native Title Act may seek redress in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) On 1 June 1994, the Prime Minister wrote to the Western  Australian Premier indicating that titles issued in disregard of the provisions of the Native Title Act may be rendered invalid if the High Court rules in favour of the Commonwealth in the challenge to the Act's validity. The Prime Minister suggested that the procedures under the native Title Act be used so as to reduce the number of potentially invalid titles issued prior to the High Court's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has not considered intervening in an attempt to halt the sale of land in Broome. It would not be appropriate for the Government to supervise every land dealing in a State or Territory whenever it was possible that the dealing was invalid under the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated in relation to question (2), native title holders may themselves seek redress in the courts where they consider that land dealings by a State or Territory are inconsistent with the Native Title Act. Financial assistance may be available to the native title holders for this purpose from ATSIC or from a representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body determined under s. 202 of the Native Title Act. Representative bodies may also provide legal assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes.

As part of that culture, staff are not directed to perform higher duties nor to work overtime, yet they put in the effort and time that the job demands.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a longstanding policy, Governments have not reimbursed the costs of participants in preparing submissions to the Industry Commission. I recognise the demands placed upon charitable organisations participating in the inquiry. However it is in their interest to assist the Commission so that it is fully apprised of all relevant issues and, hopefully, the inquiry will assist their longer-term performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission's main procedure of gathering information by documentary submissions has been the most constructive in terms of producing quality reports. Subsequent oral discussion of submissions at the Commission's hearings is an integral part of this process. In addition, participants can give oral evidence only at hearings if that is their wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the inquiry into Charitable Organisations, the Commission is particularly mindful of the costs involved for participants, and has varied its usual inquiry mechanisms to minimise these costs. For example, it has met with representatives of groups of charities, who have sat and talked the issues through with the Commission, rather than put those groups to the effort of preparing overarching submissions. It has also taken every opportunity to seek oral evidence from participants and has scheduled public hearings at a wide number of venues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also relevant that the Government has a Community Organisations' Support Program (COSP) administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. COSP provides funding to peak charitable organisations, including the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), as a </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contribution towards their secretariat/liaison costs, particularly in respect of consultation with Government departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under COSP, peak community organisations are also eligible to apply for one-off grants to undertake special projects. Under this provision ACOSS was provided with funding of $29,650 to co-ordinate a community sector response to the Industry Commission's draft report on Charitable Organisations.
