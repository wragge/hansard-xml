<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 284, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 22 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.32A(3) provides that where an accredited laboratory tests a remaining sample and confirms that there is the possibility of a positive result for the sample, it does not have to notify the competitor of the results of the test. This does not appear to rule out the possibility that the accredited laboratory may notify the competitor, if it wishes. On the other hand, where the laboratory does not confirm the possibility of a positive result, the competitor must be notified.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 22 September 1994 concerning the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules No 284.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new regulations were made to overcome the problem of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) being downgraded by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to Phase 2 testing status in June this year. Under IOC rules a Phase 2 status laboratory can test the A sample but cannot test the confirmatory B sample. Confirmatory analysis must be performed by a full accredited IOC laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provide for a laboratory that does not have full accreditation to forward samples to a fully accredited laboratory for confirmatory analysis. They have allowed AGAL to continue to analyse A samples collected by the Agency and, when analysis reveals the possibility of a positive result on the A sample, to forward the residue of the A sample together with the unopened B sample to a fully accredited laboratory for confirmatory analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New regulations 32A and 32B apply to situations only in which a partially accredited laboratory forwards A and B samples to a fully accredited laboratory for confirmatory analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New regulation 32A(3) prevents an accredited laboratory from notifying a competitor of the possibility of a positive test result. The laboratory is required by regulation 30(2) to notify the Agency of the result and, in accordance with the requirements of regulation 31(2), the Agency notifies the competitor fo the A sample result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New regulation 32A(4) requires a fully accredited laboratory analysing the residue to an A sample to notify the result of the A sample analysis if it does not confirm the possibility of a positive test result. If this occurred the result would be deemed negative and the B sample would not be analysed. The laboratory is required by regulation 30(1) to notify the Agency of the result and, in accordance with the requirements of regulation 31(1), the Agency notifies the competitor of the A sample result. Reference to the accredited laboratory notifying the competitor of the test result is a drafting error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accredited laboratories are never given the names of competitors who provide samples. They only receive documentation identifying samples by sample numbers. It is impossible for laboratories to directly notify competitors of either positive or negative test results. The Agency is responsible for notifying competitors of all test results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have instructed the Agency to make the necessary arrangements to amend the Regulations so that it is clear that accredited laboratories notify the Agency of both positive and negative test results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your advice on the reasons why the crimes for which the suspended officer were convicted are regarded as infamous crimes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (the Commission), I am able to provide the following advice in response to you queries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument states, at para 2,: ". . . The convictions for the two offences under section 1347 involve dishonesty and having regard to the nature of the office of Regional Councillor and the role of a Regional Council constitute misbehaviour for the purposes of section 122A of the Act. The Commission regards misbehaviour as including conviction for an infamous crime, such as the two suffered by Malcolm Edward Champion under section 1347. . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by the Commission that the word `infamous' was used in its ordinary sense; the Macquarie Dictionary defines it as "of ill fame; having an extremely bad reputation; . . . shamefully bad".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 122A of the Act enables the suspension and removal of a Regional Councillor from office because of misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. Section 4A(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may make a written determination providing that specified behaviour is taken to be misbehaviour for the purposes of the Act. I made the ATSIC (Misbehaviour) Determination, 1994 No. 1 (the Misbehaviour Determination), on 25 February 1994 (published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 2 March 1994). The suspension of Mr Champion occurred on 20 September 1994. However, the suspension was in respect of conduct and convictions which occurred before the making of the Misbehaviour Determination. The suspension was not based under the Misbehaviour Determination, since the Determination could not be applied retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice to the Commission from Special Counsel indicated that suspension for misbehaviour could occur regardless of the Misbehaviour Determination for the purposes of s.122A under the `ordinary meaning of misbehaviour'. Special Counsel stated: "You express the view that the determination may not be applied retrospectively. The determination expands the meaning of misbehaviour (see definition of `misbehaviour' in s.4(1)). Since the conduct and the convictions preceded the making of the determination, the determination is inapplicable. It is therefore necessary to apply s.122A on the basis of the ordinary meaning of `misbehaviour'." Special Counsel further advised the Commission that the two convictions under section 1347 "can, in my view, constitute mibehaviour for the purposes of s.122A. . . . I note, in this respect, that misbehaviour has always been interpreted as including conviction for an infamous crime."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the suspension was not effected pursuant to the Misbehaviour Determination, the instrument correctly does not refer to it. I confirm that it was validly made under s.122A.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of eight World Trade Organisation bills we are now debating cognately is a reflection of the legislative action that we in Australia need to take to have our laws conform with the new international trade arrangements that have been put in place as a result of the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations&mdash;which, as we are all aware, took many years and which have culminated in the opening up of an enormous prospect for the future, a new era of freer and fairer world trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has modelled the long-term benefits to Australia from the freeing up of trade in manufacturing, agriculture and resources and has very conservatively estimated the benefits to Australia at $4.4 billion per annum in 1992. That is equivalent to $780 for each Australian household. More recent estimates would suggest that those figures are very conservative and that the benefits could be significantly greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1995 a new body will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has stood the world in such good stead and which has been one of the prime movers of the great liberalisation of world trade we have seen over recent decades. The GATT was one of the institutional arrangements put in place along with the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;the World Bank&mdash;at the end of the Second World War to set an institutional framework for the world in the post-war era of economic and trade development. The GATT never really fully achieved what its initiators had hoped, which was to have a world trade organisation of the nature that is now proposed as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the GATT did not get 100 per cent of the way down that road, it did get a long way down the road and the GATT has been a major organisation and force for good and for liberalisation in world trading arrangements for the last almost 50 years. It is to be replaced by the World Trade Organisation, which is the product of the World Trade Organisation agreement which has been signed and which comes into effective force on 1 January 1995. This body will be charged with maintaining compliance with the new international trade rules agreed to by member nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fulfil Australia's obligations in accordance with this agreement, which we supported, Australia must make a number of amendments to some of its own legislative arrangements which are contrary at the moment to the new trading rules. Changes are required to the following acts: the Dairy Produce Act, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, the Customs Tariff Act, the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act, the Patents Act and the Copyright Act. Most of the amendments to these acts are relatively minor in nature, although there are some points of significance as well. In addition to the amendments to those acts, a new trademarks act will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition speakers on these bills will handle different bills between them. My comments today will be restricted to three of these bills, namely, the Patents (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill, the Sales Tax (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill, and the Trade Marks Bill. The Patents (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill amends Australia's current patent laws to make those laws consistent with the agreed terms of the World Trade Organisation agreement. It will increase the standard patent term from the current 16 years to 20 years. This will apply from 1 July 1995. As a consequence of this lengthening of time for patents from 16 to 20 years, current provisions which allow for special four-year extensions of pharmaceutical patents will no longer be necessary and are therefore repealed by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also puts the onus of proof on defendants to prove that their products do not infringe patent conditions of similar or identical products. The bill will have a slightly positive financial impact due to increased annual fee revenue from the longer patents and lower administrative costs from the patent office. The coalition supports the World Trade Organisation agreement and does not have any problems per se with this bill and therefore we will be supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sales Tax (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill is another of the bills intended to make Australian laws conform with the World Trade Organisation agreement. It relates specifically to the special concessional treatment presently granted to certain fruit and/or vegetable juices from Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea. At the moment, if juices from those countries have a juice content greater than 25 per cent, they are subject to 11 per cent wholesale sales tax, whilst all other juices are subject to 21 per cent wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will remove the special concessional rate of sales tax which is solely applicable to the juice products of these three nations by putting all other countries on the same basis as these three. This is necessary because, under the new international trade arrangements, all member nations' products must be treated equally and without discrimination. The lower rate of wholesale sales tax of 11 per cent will therefore apply to all products with greater than 25 per cent juice content, whether they be products from Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea or products of any other national origin. Those juice products with less than 25 per cent juice content will be subject to the higher rate of wholesale sales tax of 21 per cent, again without discrimination. This bill will come into force on 1 January 1995 or on the day on which the World Trade Organisation agreement enters into force, whichever is later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern amongst citrus growers in Australia that the removal of this last remaining protection for their industry will leave them in an unfair position vis-a-vis cheap concentrate imports from Brazil. The coalition fully understands and acknowledges the concern of those growers. Whilst Australia should not be prepared to flout the new world trading rules by maintaining the existing discriminatory tax treatment, there are positive measures which the government could take to assist the domestic citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where the coalition has called on the government to act for our growers is to allow growers to claim depreciation of their plantations for tax deductibility. This is in accord with the treatment by other competing countries like the United States and New Zealand, and it follows a recommendation from the Industry Commission's report into this industry. The government has, in principle, heeded the coalition's calls on the depreciation issue, and we welcome  that. We did announce some time ago that we would be in favour of and we would support, and in government we would introduce, depreciation arrangements along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, once again, has picked up the coalition's policy to some extent in this area and has now, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, announced just a couple of days ago on 29 November that the government has agreed to this measure as part of a broader horticultural package designed to allay some of the industry's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in that context, though, the recommendations of the report of the Economics Legislation Committee which has just been presented to the Senate. The first recommendation at paragraph 1.22 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the World Trade Organisation Amendment Bills and the provisions of the Copyright (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>But then paragraph 1.23 goes on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee notes the concerns of the Liberal Party Senators representing the Coalition who have expressed their dissatisfaction at the inadequacy of the Government's response to the recommendations of the Horticultural Task Force and the problems faced by citrus growers.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we do not believe that the government's proposals announced on 29 November have gone far enough to meet the needs, the concerns and the requirements of the horticultural industry. The minister should have been able to announce more details of the government's proposals but, unfortunately, he has not apparently been able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, Mr Anderson, has described the package, quite rightly, as `miserly' for failing to address serious issues affecting this very important industry. We would have expected the minister to have responded to every recommendation of the horticultural task force. He has not and there are quite a number of outstanding matters. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a pretty poor package.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell says, it was a pretty poor, measly, miserly and ill-thought through package, which is typical of the way this government goes about its legislation. The government has not responded to each recommendation of the horticultural task force. There are quite a number of important outstanding matters, for example, the 150 per cent tax deductibility for ISO 9,000 series quality certification and additional funding for the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation to examine export market quarantine barriers. No action has been taken on harvest labour shortages. There has been an inadequate response to industry concerns about superannuation. There has been no abolition of part X of the TPC Act which exempts certain shipping from the act and, as a consequence, imposes additional costs on exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the government must continue to do more to assist the restructuring of this industry to ensure that it can be internationally competitive. The fact that it has not done what is required to be done is very much in line with its inability to assist industries to take the necessary restructuring that is required if we are going to be the internationally competitive nation that we need to be if we are going to maintain and build on our living standards in the years ahead. Having said those things, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third bill that I wish to comment on is the Trade Marks Bill 1994. This bill introduces new trade marks laws which are consistent with the principles and requirements of the World Trade Organisation agreement. The new regime will replace the 1955 Trade Marks Act. The new regime, which mainly makes simplification changes to the existing system, brings Australian trade mark law into conformity with Australia's obligations under the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, known by the acronym TRIPS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the registration of trade marks and sets out and protects the rights deriving from such registration. There are new provisions dealing with the `association' of trade marks which will place the onus of identity on trade mark owners rather than on the Registrar of Trade Marks. The use of the term `owner' replaces the old language `proprietor' of trade marks. The estimated establishment cost of this new regime, including retraining staff and computer systems upgrading, is $4 million. Other than that, the trade marks system operates on full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, and as already outlined in the other place by the coalition industry spokesman, Mr Moore, the government has acknowledged that there is a need for further considerations with respect to the new Trade Marks Act operating under the World Trade Organisation provisions. Next year, the government, as I understand it, may be bringing forward some further amendments to address various matters which have been raised with it. The coalition accepts the government's word that it will look at these matters closely and return to the parliament with amendments, if necessary, next year. We will hold the government to that review and monitor its progress on that. We look forward to further consideration of those matters in due course. In the meantime, though, the coalition will be supporting this bill as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues later on in the debate, as I foreshadowed at the start, will comment on other aspects of the package. As I say, it is a package of bills required to enable Australian legislation to accord with the new World Trade Organisation's agreement. We hold, as does the whole world, great store in the opportunities that the new agreements will present to us all for a new era in world trade liberalisation and a faster rate of growth and improvement for living standards in all countries right across the spectrum from the most developed to the least. It is a major step forward in world trading arrangements. We fully support that. Therefore, we support the necessary amending legislation required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the fundamental point that needs to be made in this debate about the citrus industry is that any assistance provided to that industry through the sales tax mechanism, which is the area from which the industry sought its relief, in effect would not have greatly assisted the growers themselves. It would have effectively assisted consumers, it would have assisted manufacturers of juice, but it would not have assisted growers to any great extent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point in a moment. It is the growers who wanted the assistance. However, the reductions in protection in overseas markets as a result of the GATT Uruguay Round outcome, as well as the government's support announced in the package, will increase citrus exports, which will be a much more effective way of improving growers' returns. I will refer to export statistics and why it is so important that that is the way in which the industry heads for its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another option available under the GATT negotiations, and that was to so-called `tariffy' the protection that is currently provided by sales tax provisions. In fact, the government did consult with the industry, the Australian Citrus Industry Council, and it agreed with the government's assessment that the domestic price paid for oranges destined for juice concentrate was close to the import parity price for imported frozen concentrate orange juice. Thus, no tariff value could be attributed to the local content rule. Even if one could, it would require a tariff of the order of 100, 200 or 300 per cent to protect the Australian citrus concentrate juice industry from Brazil. And why? It is not because of cheap labour. That is a great myth. The Brazilian industry is not based on cheap labour. The Brazilian industry, which is the largest in the world, produces&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Owned largely by way of investment from the US. Secondly, it is technologically very advanced. In Brazil, oranges are picked through mechanisation; they are not picked by hand. They only grow for one market: the citrus juice concentrate market. They do not grow for the whole fruit market. The third factor which makes the Brazilians much more competitive is that they do not require the more expensive irrigation that at least three areas in Australia require. So for those three reasons Australia cannot compete in the citrus juice concentrate market, and the growers accept that. They know they cannot compete dollar for dollar against Brazil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two areas in which the Australian citrus industry can compete: the whole fruit export market and the fresh juice market. Unfortunately, in Australia, particularly in the three southern regions&mdash;New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria&mdash;a significant proportion of their production, and for most growers the majority, goes to juice concentrate. The tables which I have just incorporated show that those who grow for the concentrate sector receive $90 a tonne and their production costs are $150 a tonne. Clearly, growers cannot make any profit in the concentrate area. However, with regard to fresh juice products, growers receive $176 a tonne. So they make a small profit in that area. With regard to domestic fresh orange sales, they receive $200 a tonne. Obviously, they make a reasonable profit in that area. With regard to export sales of fresh navel oranges and valencias, the figures are $324 a tonne and $224 a tonne respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last six years, Australian exports of citrus have grown from 32,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes last year and are valued at $89 million. Interestingly, the proportion of production of citrus for export has risen from six per cent to over 14 per cent last year. That is clearly where the future lies, and the industry certainly knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the Queensland industry; I am sure that Senator Boswell is aware of it. The Queensland citrus industry is, by comparison with its southern counterparts, relatively successful. Why?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Boswell" NAMEID="YE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is successful because it has a market opportunity, which is due to its strategic geographical and climate position. But there are two other reasons why the citrus industry in Queensland is much more successful than its southern counterpart. I have visited the growing area in southern Queensland. The farms are much larger and the production units are much more efficient. Senator Boswell is nodding; he agrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second, and most critical, factor is that in Queensland the growers hand-pick their oranges. Eighty to 90 per cent of the fruit in Queensland is of such good quality that it is sold as whole fruit either domestically or for export. Only the waste&mdash;10 per cent of the product&mdash;goes to juice. In the southern areas, only 30 per cent of the oranges goes to whole fruit production, while 70 per cent goes to juice production. For the citrus industry to survive in southern Australia&mdash;and the growers accept this&mdash;the growers have to increase their pack-out rate from 30 per cent to at least 60 or 70 per cent. There is no survival for the citrus industry in juice concentrate. It is not a pleasant message, but there is no absolutely no way that it can compete in that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's package is aimed at ensuring that the citrus industry develops in both the fresh juice market and the export market. I will outline a couple of areas. The industry says that the $9 million package over five years is not enough. Unfortunately, it is never enough. We always get claims to government. </PARA>

We are increasing expenditure by $9 million outside normal budget allocations, yet he keeps saying to us, `Reduce budget expenditure. Make cutbacks.' Where would he make the cutbacks or increase the taxes to fund the increase in this area? Where would he increase taxes? He cannot give us an answer. His problem is that he is stuck for an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of assistance the government is providing is a write-off of expenditure on all new horticultural plantations.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell has not heard. I am just about to run through some of the programs. We need to look at a quality program; export marketing; product identity, because we do not have good product identity in the international marketplace; citrus promotion; research for new markets; and fresh juice promotion. Those are the sorts of areas that the $9 million should be devoted to. The industry will have a major input into how that money is spent. A citrus group, of which I understand I will be a member, will be charged with the responsibility of developing those programs for the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to revert back to the sales tax issue. The industry's preferred approach was a sales tax option of zero on fresh juice beverages. What would that have returned to the growers? We need to help the growers; we are not helping the processors or the consumers. The economic modelling that the government has done shows that that would have returned only $0.5 million to growers' pockets, which would have returned only $162 to each grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the industry's preferred position in playing around with the sales tax regime would not have given any great assistance to growers. That is why, aside from the fact that it would almost certainly have been GATT inconsistent with the fiddling around of the sales tax regime, depending on which sales tax package was picked up, it would have cost the government significant millions of dollars in revenue. That is why the government decided that the sales tax approach was the wrong approach. Unfortunately, the citrus industry has become a little obsessive about the sales tax issue, but it is not the solution to its problems. A solution for the growers does not lie in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The citrus industry is a great Australian industry, valued at $320 million. There are 3,000 citrus growers in Australia. As I said earlier when I tabled statistics relating to the citrus industry, the unfortunate fact is that growers in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria are not able, and never will be able, to compete in that juice concentrate area. It is just not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of fundamental problems that growers face in the southern states. Many of their properties are too small.

It is primarily a state government responsibility, Senator Watson, which the states have grossly neglected. For example, state governments put soldier settlers in the irrigation areas and did not upgrade the infrastructure. If one were to go to the Murrumbidgee area, one would see open channel irrigation. I feel great sympathy for growers who are put into these areas where governments do not upgrade the irrigation and make sure that there is effective, modern and cost effective delivery of water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already outlined some of the other problems of the citrus industry. This government is very well aware of the problems the industry faces. That is one of the reasons why there was a specific task force to look at the problems. The Queensland industry&mdash;and Senator Boswell is here&mdash;shows the way in which the industry has to develop. It has to look at the fundamental advantages and the fundamental criteria that the Queensland industry has and it has to model itself largely on that approach. There is not any other option. We have got to move those export figures as quickly as we can because that is where survival lies. The figures over the last five years have been very good and, with the sort of package we have designed, they should continue to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the GATT, there will be significant progress in market access, in getting our citrus industry exports overseas and breaking into those markets where there is unreasonable protection. For example, apples and citrus are two of the target commodities to break into the China market and GATT gives us the opportunity to make those breakthroughs. I have concentrated my comments on the citrus industry because I know it is a matter of deep concern to many senators. It has been mentioned by Senator Short and I am sure it will be mentioned by others in the debate. The government package is a responsible one. It is correctly targeted and it really was the only way in which effective assistance could have been provided to the citrus industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are cognately debating bills which represent the government's response to Australia's Uruguay Round obligations. The changes introduced by these bills are scheduled to come into operation on the commencement of the World Trade Organisation agreement scheduled for 1 July 1995 or some later date as declared under these bills. Five bills being introduced under this package relate to the areas of copyright, patents, dairy produce and new sales tax regimes for fruit juice and cheese, and there are two bills with amendments to our anti-dumping and countervailing laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round of GATT has been under negotiation since 1986. For the first time agriculture was considered within the GATT round. Australia through the Cairns Group played a major role in encouraging an outcome to the ultimate benefit of our primary industries. Our internationally efficient primary industries have suffered and continue to suffer from years of savaging from the high subsidy practices of other developed nations&mdash;in the main, the Economic Union, the US and Japan. As a consequence, Australian primary industries will benefit from the outcome of the Uruguay Round. It must be said that our wheat, beef, sugar and rice industries will benefit from these reforms but not to the full extent that they should. At the same time, some primary industries will have to undergo adjustments to their present arrangements, which has necessitated these present bills under debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further consequence of the Uruguay Round agreements is that other primary industries which receive no assistance at all, such as the pork and egg industries, will be thrust into a new marketing scheme where trade is opened up for imports into Australia while at the same time tariff levels will still be very high for competing countries thereby thrusting Australian industries into a most unfair international trading situation. At this stage it must be pointed out that Australian primary industries played an integral role in attaining a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. They led by example and selflessly took enormous cuts in tariffs, deregulated domestic markets and gave up other assistance measures at enormous cost to primary industries and individual primary producers. They are the real, unsung heroes of the Uruguay Round resolution. Sadly, they form a long line of casualties as they have been forced to adjust rapidly to free trade which other competing nations were not practising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Uruguay Round agreement, tariffs will be cut by an average of 36 per cent with a minimum for individual items of 15 per cent, volumes of subsidised exports will be cut by 21 per cent and outlays on export subsidies will be cut by 36 per cent over a six-year implementation period for developed countries and 10 years for developing countries. Overall, the value of domestic support for agriculture is to be reduced by 20 per cent from the base level in 1986-88. ABARE predicts a $1 billion benefit to Australian rural industries from the liberalisation of world trade resulting from the resolution of the Uruguay Round. However, particular rural industries which will be severely hurt by the outcome will have to face a future of changed circumstances and new threats to their continued survival. These industries involve the smaller primary industries of citrus, tobacco, pig farming and egg producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two ways that some rural industries will suffer hurt rather than benefit from the Uruguay Round agreement: firstly, from the domestic changes reflected in these bills and, secondly, from the remaining unfair trading situations that will still exist even after tariff and other subsidy reforms have been implemented in competing countries over the six-year implementation period. For some countries with enormously high tariff levels at present, a 35 per cent reduction will still leave them with very high tariffs and a trading advantage over the unassisted Australian industries. For example, even after a 36 per cent tariff reduction, rice tariffs in Japan will stand at a massive 700 per cent. Canadian tariffs on egg products will only reduce from 196 per cent to 167 per cent&mdash;a reduction from 94c a dozen to 80c a dozen. The unassisted Australian egg industry has been receiving 84c a dozen from the consumer for the last five years. So the subsidy for Canadian eggs is as much as the Australian producer gets for the sale of his eggs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at where other citrus producing countries will be in the year 2001, at the end of the six-year implementation period. At five per cent, Australian producers will effectively have no tariffs. The US will only go from 47 per cent to 40 per cent, Brazil from 105 per cent to 35 per cent, Israel from 142 per cent to 120 per cent, Japan from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and Spain and Italy from 44 per cent to 38 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out again that Australia is at zero tariffs. This will be the new trading environment Australian producers will have to compete in&mdash;still against high tariffs. Also, Australian industries enjoying no tariff protection at the same time will have to adjust to liberalised quarantine requirements opening up an influx of imports of highly subsidised products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills being debated today contain changes to present schemes which are considered contrary to GATT. Australia, in its lonely and hard path over recent years, has ended up with one of the least assisted primary industry sectors in the world. Accordingly, there are very few schemes which require amending by means of domestic legislation to comply with GATT. The exceptions are the dairy export scheme, the local sales tax regime for fruit juice and the local content scheme for tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the National Party Leader in the Senate, I would like to address these bills as they affect the citrus, tobacco and dairy industries. The Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization) Amendment Bill provides for the termination of the market support payments to the dairy industry. The export subsidy scheme is to be terminated from 30 June 1995 and a new domestic market support mechanism is to be introduced from July 1995. At the moment, levies are imposed on the industry on the milk fat content of whole milk and its products. These levies go to a market support fund for payment to all exports of dairy products. This bill brings forward the termination date of the scheme from 30 June 2000 set by the Crean plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the eve of the Senate being asked to pass this legislation, the government has declared its new dairy scheme, which in effect replaces present arrangements with a scheme of the same benefit but which is GATT legal. With the qualification that the government should have and could have announced its dairy plan earlier than the day before this legislation, the coalition supports the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE predicts that the dairy industry will benefit from the implementation of the Uruguay Round reforms through four per cent world price increases for butter, 12 per cent for cheese and 16 per cent for milk powders. Also, Australian production will have a one per cent increase in volume, worth $320 million, and a 10 per cent increase in exports, worth $210 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the industry, particularly Pat Rowley, on its restructuring and management of the industry and on the development of a highly successful export industry. Under the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization) Bill, the concessional sales tax rate that currently applies to fruit and vegetable juice products from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea will be terminated, with all juice and fruit products from all countries that contain greater than 25 per cent juice being taxed at 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill, in particular on the citrus industry, will be to introduce major changes to be encountered by growers. These industries have been structured on and have operated on the current sales tax system for 60 years, and new sales tax arrangements will impact immediately as reduced sales and reduced demand for their product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government conducted an inquiry into the citrus and horticultural industries and sat on the report for over a year, creating great uncertainty for industry planning. On Tuesday of this week, two days before the Senate was meant to vote on major industry changes, the government brought in a most inadequate industry support package. I would describe it as absolutely pathetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, despite its horticultural task force recommendation, decided against introducing a zero sales tax rate for pure fruit juice and mixed juices, currently at a rate of 11 per cent, despite the fact that other beverages such as milk, tea and coffee enjoy a zero sales tax status. Since the government will not act, it has to face up to the continued survival of the Australian citrus industry, which the government has given a mere $9 million package. It is a poor way to treat a viable but smaller Australian primary industry. It is the same with the tobacco industry; it has also not been given its promised package, and I have taken this up with Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mareeba-Dimbulah region of North Queensland has supported a thriving tobacco industry since the government set up an import replacement industry in the 1930s. Even in its present rationalised position, tobacco growing is the mainstay of these regions, providing $50 million a year to local economies. As I mentioned earlier, the tobacco industry is one of the smaller industries that, in the overall interests of free trade under the Uruguay Round agreement, have become a victim of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Uruguay Round schedule for tobacco submitted by the Australian government, a tariff quota for imported tobacco has been set at 11.184 million kilograms. This large quota was based on the base years of 1986-88, when much higher quantities of tobacco were being manufactured than at present. It is interesting that all sectors of the industry&mdash;the growers, the manufacturers and the government and its trade officials&mdash;agree that, because the new import quota level is based on a very high base level, the resulting tariff quota is incorrectly based. The new quota leaves the local industry with only 20 per cent of the market to supply, on top of a 35 per cent reduction in quota last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain basic facts are relevant to the present plight of the tobacco industry. Tobacco growers are like all other farmers&mdash;growers of a legal crop. Over the last 10 years, tobacco growers have faced the problems in their industry and have rationalised with 50 per cent of the growers leaving the industry. At the same time, the government has received great windfalls from the industry. Last year excise duties amounted to $1.4 billion, which is up from $189,000 in 1964. State licence fees were $7.348 billion. All in all, total government revenue amounted to $8.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry now needs time and help to restructure. Government injection of direct assistance to the tobacco industry is needed as a necessary consequence of the major adjustment demanded by the harsh GATT schedule on the industry. It appears that the government is virtually deserting these smaller industries adversely affected by the GATT commitments. The tobacco, citrus, egg and pork industries are all in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, overseas governments have acted on compensating their industries that are being damaged by the new GATT requirements. In Japan the government has committed $83 billion&mdash;not million&mdash;to help its protected farmers adjust to foreign competition, with an extra $16.3 billion to help rural regions develop new businesses. The US has made trade-offs to assist its farmers. These vital industries such as the tobacco and the citrus industries, although small, should not be left to wither and die without adequate and comprehensive industry adjustment support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect following from the Uruguay Round agreement relates to the changes that will be made to our anti-dumping and countervailing legislation by means of the customs legislation, including the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. It is an area of particular interest to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the credit of the government, during former Senator Button's term in the industry portfolio, important reforms were introduced for primary industries which reflect the recommendations of the Senate inquiry that I initiated. These included the extension of actions to farmers who suffer from the presence of dumped and subsidised processed imports in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the government's 1991 March industry statement which was described by former Senator Button in a December ministerial statement as the `changes to our anti-dumping and countervailing laws intended to provide better access to the system for Australian producers'. This was further reflected in the March industry statement which said that legislation would be drafted along the lines of that in place in the United States to ensure that the injuries suffered by agriculture and horticulture as a result of dumping or subsidisation of processed products will be taken into consideration in dumping and countervailing actions. This will give agricultural and horticultural producers, when they are truly integrated, an avenue for redress when they fall victim to unfair trading practices in the processed products part of their industry. However, the bills being debated today, which formalise the GATT requirements, make changes which will affect the 1991 reforms for better access for farmers to anti-dumping and countervailing actions and better avenues for redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time formal standing requirements are being introduced before an applicant can bring an anti-dumping or countervailing action. Under proposed new clause 15D an applicant must now have the support of persons producing 50 per cent of the total production of the like good in Australia. Of this 50 per cent support, the applicant must account for 25 per cent of the production of the like goods in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This differs from the present position where any person may initiate an anti-dumping or countervailing action. There is no legislated standing requirement and whether or not the applicant is supported by the wider part of the industry concerned is not legally relevant. Under the amendments only support from the processing industry can be used in the calculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless farmers can get the support of the majority of processors they will be prevented from launching an anti-dumping action. Customs pointed out to the Senate committee hearing that the present form has a section to be filled in stating that the application is supported by a majority of the industry&mdash;this being an administrative requirement rather than the formal legalised requirement it will now become. It appears that the industry is fairly disillusioned with our anti-dumping scheme&mdash;it is extremely costly and unpredictable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With increasing trade liberalisation, Australian industry needs a fair and effective anti-dumping and countervailing system. I was pleased to be reassured by the government at the Senate committee hearing that the Australian industry, for the purpose of determining material injury, will still include the closed processed agricultural industry. But, in the case of dumping and subsidisation, it is the farmer who suffers from the loss of sales and reduced prices from the presence in the domestic market of dumped and subsidised processed goods. These amendments, in making it harder legally for farmers to initiate actions, can only make a hard path even harder for the farmer in the uphill battle against dumped and imported subsidised goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support these bills in the interest of ensuring that Australia fulfils its Uruguay Round obligations. But in doing so I criticise the government severely for forcing the opposition to vote for these bills when the dairy package and the inadequate citrus package were only announced within days of the vote, and there is no tobacco package at all. I strongly emphasise the need for an effective anti-dumping and countervailing system for Australian industries and register my concern about the even more difficult path that will face  farmers who are now real victims of dumped and subsidised imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition finds itself between a rock and a hard place with these bills. We have enormous sympathy for the position that some of the smaller industries find themselves in, particularly the citrus industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> But the benefits and the gains of changes in world trade for the winning industries cannot be put under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the NFF has spoken strongly on behalf of its rural industry members, who want these bills to go through unamended. It has also called for periods of managed change for its industries that will suffer, which we have wholeheartedly and continually called for. The Uruguay Round agreements have tied Australia to certain formal requirements. The gains that will be made for primary industries are welcomed and the farmers are to be congratulated for their contribution to the efforts. However, the pain felt by some smaller industries could have been lessened by a more generous and far-sighted approach by the federal government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I would like to speak on the anti-dumping provisions in the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994. The Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 to bring Australia into line with the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement and the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement. Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing measures regime is very similar to the existing codes. Many of the amendments in the bill would as a result enact procedures that are already followed at an administrative level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important amendments proposed in the bill would alter the methodology of determining whether dumping had occurred. Dumping is actionable when the export price of the goods concerned is less than the normal value of the goods and material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or threatened or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10 of the bill clarifies the procedures for determining the normal value of a good. In some cases the price of a good in its domestic market is not an appropriate measure of its normal value. For example, a product might not be sold on the domestic market. If such a situation exists, the value of the good is determined on the basis of its price in the third country or by assigning to it a notional value. The bill sets out criteria for selecting an appropriate third country and details the factors that have to be taken into account in constructing a normal value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of dumping is currently determined by comparing the export price of a product with its normal value on a transaction by transaction basis. Clause 11 of the bill adds two new methods of determining the existence of dumping which may simplify investigations in some cases. Clause 15 of the bill proposes to require that an anti-dumping application be supported by, firstly, producers that represent more than 50 per cent of the total production or output of that proportion of the industry that indicates its support or opposition to the application and, secondly, producers that represent not less than 25 per cent of the total production of goods in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-dumping applications are currently required to be supported by producers who represent a major proportion of the total domestic output, but major proportion has never been precisely defined. Clause 12 proposes to amend the system for assessing the material injury to industry due to dumping or to subsidisation. Section 269TAE of the Customs Act lists a number of indicators that can be used to assess the injury. Clause 12 adds the size of the dumping margin if relevant or the particulars of the subsidy concerned to the list. The bill adds to the section a list of factors such as contractions in demand that must be considered as possible alternative causes for the injury and tightens the definition of a threatened injury by limiting it to foreseeable and imminent threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports the World Trade Organisation package. We nonetheless have a number of concerns about the government's administration of the anti-dumping and countervailing system. I foreshadow that the coalition will be moving a second reading amendment to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of those amendments is to urge the government to significantly reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping and to ensure that the administration of the anti-dumping system, and particularly the material injury provisions, is no more stringent than the comparable policies adopted by other members of the World Trade Organisation. The purpose of that is for the administrators not to take a harder line than that which other countries are taking, because that is really pretty stupid.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some years now Australian industries have pointed out that the government's administration of the anti-dumping system is significantly tighter than that in overseas jurisdictions, such as the United States. In the Thai tuna case, it was impossible to obtain accurate information about the normal value of Thai canned tuna exports because none of the 12 exporters answered Customs' questions; nine of the 12 refused access to their premises and records; and the three who did provide information provided highly selective material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information submitted to Customs by the Australian industry revealed that the dumping margin for Thai tuna was about 52 per cent. The Australian Customs Service based its constructed values on the inadequate and unrepresentative information that was supplied by the three cooperative tuna exporters. In short, the uncooperative foreign exporters were favoured at the expense of the Australian industry, in contrast with the US system where uncooperative foreign exporters were penalised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The `World Trade Organisation bills'&mdash;what is wrong with that title? The main thing wrong with it is that we are not actually considering whether we want to belong to the World Trade Organisation, what it might mean for us, what it might mean for all Australians, what it might mean for Australian law or the democratic process we have in this country or in this place. We are not asked to consider who might win or who might lose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might get some vague reassurances of generalised wellbeing. This will mean so many million dollars in extra trade. Is this a good thing? Even economically, it depends on the ratio between imports and exports. Trade by itself is not an advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when we talk exports, there are questions. This will mean so many millions in extra exports. Which industries will that affect? How will that affect jobs? How will it affect the capacity to develop in the future? Economically, questions arise like: how much value added is there in these exports? Are we talking low value added tonnage increases? In that case, will X million in exports translate into much real good for the economy? Will it translate into investment if part of the package is to deregulate investment and money transfers so that there are no multiplier effects and the profits simply all vanish into the international market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking some general questions, although they do not appear to be in the context of these bills. The major rationale for what we are doing in these bills is that the changes are required for the World Trade Organisation. There is no good reason, no independent reason, being put for any of these measures. Nowhere in the explanatory memoranda or second reading speeches from the House do we hear, `Our present dairy support arrangements are no good because they hurt our industries or they have this negative effect.' No. The only reason on offer is that our laws are World Trade Organisation inconsistent. So, if the only reason on offer for these changes is that we need them for the World Trade Organisation, questions about why we need the World Trade Organisation are completely in context and in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are general assurances that freer trade will have benefits. It will have casualties too, but we will skip that for the moment. In other cases, we could make general assertions. Foreign aid will have great benefits for both donor and recipient. Yet I do not see us rushing out to increase our aid budget or even to bring it up to the recommended level of 0.7 per cent. Development of energy efficiency and energy conservation will lower ecological costs, lower imports, create jobs, stimulate high-tech innovation and stimulate appropriate technology that can be exported. I do not see any push for the development of energy conservation or efficiency. We will not even meet our greenhouse targets. This target&mdash;World Trade Organisation consistency&mdash;is one which we have to meet. That this assurance&mdash;that regulating nations to assure trade is unregulated&mdash;is good for us we do not question and we act on with urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will debate the bills extensively in committee. The Greens have amendments to all of the bills, and there are other amendments also. There will be plenty of chances to look at those issues. There is almost no chance to look at the real issue&mdash;the WTO, Australian membership in it and what it will mean. The cognate debate on all these very different pieces of legislation is the only opportunity parliament will ever get to consider the WTO and the actual implications of membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told from time to time that there is no reduction of sovereignty under the WTO, that it is not an issue. We are told parliament will be responsible, will have power, that all our changes of law will have to be considered and passed in this place. If that is true as far as it goes, we will have to pass the laws here in both senses of that phrase. The laws are made here, but we will also be required here to make them WTO consistent. Just look at the panic now to assure that these laws are changed, and changed straightaway&mdash;and the WTO does not even exist yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the WTO does exist, we will be required to change more of our laws because of WTO agreements and regulations or because of challenges under existent WTO laws. How realistic is the option to say no? We can back out of WTO altogether, but what would that mean, especially after we as a nation lose more and more manufacturing and become increasingly dependent on imports for our society to run, and on exports to pay for the imports? Theoretically, it is possible to back out, but how practical and realistic is it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People here may be surprised that I am not calling for us to back out of international trade. I do think there are problems with trade dependency and I think greater self-reliance is a good thing. But what I am really calling for is responsible trade. If national and subnational governments, and the people they represent, are to be stripped of their powers to regulate any aspect of the economy, then there must be some other mechanism to regulate the economy, to bring some form of law, some level of responsibility and accountability, in relation to economic actions. Economic might does not mean economic right any more than `might makes right' works as a principle of social regulation. International monopoly or oligopoly power is not more attractive than national monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Trade Organisation is a body that will have substantially more actual power than the United Nations or any other international panel or organisation. Admittedly, on the odd occasion, the United Nations can organise troop movements or impose sanctions but, generally, it is singularly ineffectual. The situations when it acts require general support by all members and strong support by the dominant powers. The situations need to be something like Cambodia or apartheid in South Africa. Even so, if some nation breaks the sanctions, the United Nations generally does little except say `Tut-tut' and pass resolutions that get ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Convention on Human Rights has been in place for decades and signatories still do pretty much what they want to. As signatories we followed the White Australia policy with impunity. If we look closely, there are many laws and practices which do not conform to the convention. Even the privacy bill does not really address the question of rights of gays and lesbians. But the United Nations does not have any program to demand consistency with the human rights convention. It is an undertaking of the signatories. The United Nations might point out cases brought to its attention as flagrant violations and might chide nations, but it actually does nothing. It has no power in relation to any but the worst abuses&mdash;quasi-slavery, genocide or invasions&mdash;and even then only when member nations are individually willing to take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the World Trade Organisation has in its charter that all member nations must make their federal and subfederal laws WTO consistent. By the way, even local government laws can be changed. The WTO can and will take action. It can and will impose economic sanctions. The options are to conform with the WTO or, if it gets up, which looks probable, to be outside it. Once the WTO gets up GATT disappears, although if the WTO does not get up GATT continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a difference between GATT and the World Trade Organisation? Yes. The GATT was less powerful and nations had to sign on</PARA>
<PARA>to various agreements on trade. Not all agreements were signed. Once GATT disappears, the World Trade Organisation will have powers to establish regulations that apply to all members on the basis of a two-thirds, or occasionally a three-quarter, vote of members. All member nations then need to make their laws conform, unless they want to leave the WTO or face sanctions. So we could, in the future, vote against a new regulation and we would still have it imposed on us. What kind of sovereignty is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How democratic is this? Who is the representative of the Australian people in an organisation which sets the framework for Australian law? How is that representative chosen? People may not know that our ambassador to the WTO, Don Kenyan, serves a three-year term and is now finishing his first year. He is not elected; he is appointed. He takes direction from the minister. The position he takes does not need to be consistent with Australian law, or any position of the parliament, or any position of the people, nor does he need to consult with anyone except the minister and the department. He effectively has the power to push for WTO rules, admittedly at the direction of the minister, which the WTO will then ask Australia to make its laws consistent with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Must we, the parliament, then change our laws? Not technically; we can always leave the WTO or face sanctions. I ask those in this chamber to answer honestly to themselves whether that is likely. I ask them to look at what we are currently doing: we are pushing through changes of law without much real reason to make them consistent with the WTO. I ask them to look at the panic that is whipped up if anyone suggests that we would not change any of these laws in a way that is WTO consistent, no matter what reason is offered for non-WTO law in terms of its effect on Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there are only two options: we can shut up, join up and take orders or we can lose out on the WTO-Uruguay Round goldmine. Is it really that simple, that stark a choice? I do not believe it. There must be some options. Is there any way of making this thing more accountable? Is there any way of assuring that the Australian people actually get some voice and that legitimate social concerns can be addressed? Is there any way of granting greater latitude for national regulation which may affect trade but is primarily pursuing valid social goals? Is there any way of assuring that the benefits of the WTO actually go towards improving the lot of the majority of people, and specifically those most in need?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the consequences of the WTO regime are a race to the bottom, to the lowest standard of public and environmental protection, to the most exploitative practices, to increased concentration of economic power, is there any way of monitoring that, of turning it around? Today we see that the ones who will survive in the citrus industry will be the big ones, the ones who use most water and most inputs. Just think of what we have said. I would suggest, and I know I do not get much support in this place on this, that it is imperative to ask these questions now and do what we can to ensure that some options, some accountability and some responsibility are built into the WTO before it is set up. If we do not do this, we will be left with the stark choice: comply or suffer the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has made great running on the issue of treaties. It whips up fear about the loss of sovereignty in relation to the human rights convention, the desertification convention and other agreements that really have little power or teeth, very little effect. The only thing these conventions really do is provide a basis for federal government to act if it decides to. There are no enforceable requirements besides a few treaties that might generate real action like the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and even that is enforced haphazardly. Here we have a case where we are required to change our laws, including state and local laws, whether or not federal government agrees. If another nation says that they are not consistent with the WTO, attempts will be made to force us to do so. We can refuse to change our laws, but there will be penalties. We can leave the WTO, but there will be penalties for that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will put up amendments in respect of these bills to ensure that, at the very least, if we get into this organisation, our representative respects Australian law or takes direction from federal parliament as the democratically elected body representing all Australians. I understand the Democrats will support them. They can go ahead with the support of either of the major parties. If the coalition does not support these amendments, it will be shown up as a sham which does not care a fig about real issues of sovereignty and which only raises the issue to undermine efforts to ensure human rights and prevent environmental damage. If it does not support the amendments, it would be shown up as being ignorant of the real implications of this package. I would remind the government that, while the prospect of not having to deal with real democracy and conflicting viewpoint might please it, at some point it might be a coalition cabinet which gives direction to our representatives. But then maybe neither big party worries because their economic policies are virtually identical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are deeply concerned that throughout the long process leading up to the formation of the WTO there was no effort to accurately communicate to the public the nature and structure of this organisation. There was minimal communication about the position Australia takes and has taken in the negotiations on establishing the WTO, or on issues such as the social clause, or positions taken within the trade environment subcommittee of the WTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no public consultation or any mechanism set up for public comment or input. There was no discussion in the parliament, apart from the opportunity to ask questions or debate motions. As a consequence, there are few people who are at all clear on how the WTO will work, what powers it can exercise, how it could have been set up, what options are available and what requirements it actually makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, we are told that the intellectual property bills, the patent amendment and the copyright amendment are required. Why are they required before the WTO is actually set up? What measures are actually required and which ones fall under the one-year transition period? What other measures will be required but which are not immediately required, so are not before us? Where do we see a presentation of the whole cost of the WTO, the whole impact on our legislation and the impact on people's lives and enterprises that are affected by this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we ask whether the parliament will be party to a decision to accept the WTO, the reaction we get is that there is no need; non-membership is unthinkable. In such a situation, how realistic are claims that sovereignty is not affected because we do not necessarily need to conform to WTO regulations? Yet we are not presented with what it means. Whatever legitimate questions are asked, we are met with bland reassurances or disdain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to say that the WTO is obviously good because trade is good and it will increase trade. I have my doubts, and I have my doubts about the billions of dollars that are claimed as the benefits of the Uruguay Round, or the even more billions claimed as the outcome of the APEC summit. Some figures published by ABARE indicate that non-resource extraction manufactures will decline in income by over 20 per cent under GATT and by 40 per cent under APEC. This is not just unskilled labouring; this is most moderately technical, higher-labour production. It probably includes a range of elaborately transformed manufactures. There may be a range of very high-tech research-intensive or niche market items which will not be affected. But, realistically, how many people will work in these industries? Will the job compact take the unemployed and turn them into research scientists, skilled engineers and designers, and top-level computer programmers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we have the extractive industries&mdash;the areas that are supposed to do well from WTO. We will sell a lot more coal. Okay, but will this mean that coal prices will increase? Coal is high volume, low labour, and this means low value added. We do not get much return from the huge tonnage we sell. Will GATT, the WTO or APEC act to increase those prices? There are claims that increased demand will cause prices to rise. If we look at the evidence, with increasing freedom to trade primary commodities, demand has increased, so has supply, and prices have been steadily dropping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more demand for aluminium than ever, yet nations had to get together as a cartel and restrict supply. This benefits the companies, and maybe the nations, but it is the opposite of free trade. It does not seem that free trade has resulted in higher primary commodity prices, and that is what we are set to export more of. Primary commodities is the area in which ABARE says we will export and that is where we will increase our trade. It is not an area that holds many jobs and it is not an area that brings much return. Low profits on zinc and other minerals mean low tax payments. Low labour content means that not much money goes out into the community. Domination of production by internationalised companies under free investment means that reinvestment does not follow and investment does not necessarily occur in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we lose our manufacturing under the World Trade Organisation and APEC, our imports will increase. People keep expressing surprise that, whenever the economy recovers a bit, imports shoot up. I cannot understand why there is surprise. We do not make anything much here, so if people buy a video, a toaster, a computer, a CD-ROM drive, a shirt or a tool they will probably be buying imports. And let us face it: the myth that developing cheap-labour nations specialise in simple, low-tech goods is just that&mdash;a myth. Chinese textile factories use the latest computer knitting machines. Their factories use computer lathes. Electronic parts are churned out in Indonesia and the Philippines. Chinese TVs and stereos are displacing Japanese and Korean ones. Vietnam is the site of a number of factories for domestic appliances. We are not just talking about textiles, clothing and footwear here; we are talking about virtually all normal non-food consumer items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Many of these jobs are going or have gone. Where will the benefits be? How many farmers and design engineers does Australia reasonably expect to have? How many people do we reasonably expect them to support?

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) ensure that the administration of the anti-dumping system, and particularly the material injury provisions in the legislation, is no more stringent than the comparable policies adopted by the other members of the World Trade Organisation".</PARA>
<PARA>The motion has been circulated to honourable senators. The Liberal members of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiring into the World Trade Organisation amendment bills were moved by the sincerity and concerns expressed, particularly by the citrus growers and the problems that they will face. The package the government has offered does not address the fact that the losers in this game are essentially small people, particularly small citrus growers, and small people in most of the other areas that are covered by this legislation. The Liberal Party members were so moved that they had included in the report this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee notes the concerns of the Liberal Party Senators representing the Coalition who have expressed their dissatisfaction at the inadequacy of the Government's response to the government's recommendations of the Horticultural Task Force and the problems faced by citrus growers.</PARA>
<PARA>I listened very carefully to Senator Sherry, but he did not mention compensation for reconstruction. The small people just have to cop it sweet. That is all very well, but at the stroke of a pen people's livelihoods have suddenly been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is deceptive in appearance. Its brevity disguises the significant impact it will have on the livelihood not only of Australian citrus growers but also of their employees, such as pickers and packers, and others involved in the communications industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is conceded that the world trade agency will reap Australia significant benefits&mdash;we often hear this from the government&mdash;which have been estimated to be $2.6 billion per year, we cannot and must not lose sight of the devastating effect that this bill will have, particularly on the citrus industry. The losers cannot simply be ignored because there will be winners arising from this package. The package is completely inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to have finally seen the light. It recognised part of this fact, I think, when Senator Collins admitted on Tuesday that the termination of the local content rule will place adjustment pressure on industries currently benefiting from this measure, particularly citrus growers. But I put to the Senate that adjustment pressure is a bit of an understatement. The leadership should come from the government, but the government has failed to provide a proper recompense, failed to live up to the hopes and aspirations of all the people who attended the meetings and who made such a significant input. Senator Sherry, in his speech, virtually wrote off the future of the citrus growers in Victoria and South Australia. Where is the reconstruction focus?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government offered to alleviate the negative impacts of the bill on fruit growers? First, we have the bill here before us. At least the Liberal Party members held up the report until the thrust of the government's response was provided. This Senate is entitled to the details of the package before we pass the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let us look at the concept of taxation write-offs on expenditure on all new horticultural plantations. Details of the extent of the write-offs are extremely vague because the government has yet to resolve a number of complex issues. This is just not good enough. The government has had plenty of time. It procrastinated, for good political intent. I ask&mdash;and I ask the minister to respond&mdash;how long the provisions are designed to apply for. Will they be of short duration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the write-off actually implies an expenditure recognition or deduction during the period in which the expense was incurred. Is this correct or are we looking for a write-off in terms of an allocation over a number of years? If this is the case, we have to make sure that that write-off is at least as generous as that provided for other countries, such as New Zealand and the United States. We must ensure that our tax treatment for new plantations is not to be less generous than that given by our competitors. After all, we are now players on the world stage. If we are players on the world stage, we have to have the downside&mdash;the expenditure side&mdash;adjusted to recognise what other people are doing and what we are entitled to do. Nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the package concerns a market diversification program which is to cost $9 million over five years. The package is aimed at providing assistance to support the industry in its efforts to reduce its reliance on the juice concentrate sector and to increase sales of fresh fruit and fresh juice, with a focus on export. This is great, but it is a bit hard to expect small family organisations, people on small acreages of 10 or 20 hectares, suddenly to have to travel around Europe or Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has been asking for sales tax recognition. Why did the government not do what other countries have done in having a phase-down? Surely this would be logical. If the package is to go over five years, why can there not be compensations in relation to sales tax phase-down on a comparable basis? We are expected to have a cut-off point where suddenly people's livelihoods are affected in a very significant way, but the adjustment is over a long period of time, so there will be intense suffering in the meantime before all these so-called government assistance packages are forthcoming. The assistance which is offered is therefore disappointing. The final comment in Senator Collins's press release announcing the measures states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus is now on the horticultural industry to take up the challenge.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, the onus is still on it, but surely the onus is also on the government to provide better than it has done in attacking and destroying this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague in the House of Representatives Neil Andrew pointed to the problems that citrus growers face in breaking even and the grave problems this bill will create for those growers and their employees. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee, as I mentioned earlier, heard evidence at its public inquiry about the adverse effects on the industry. The government, in its haste to try to ram these bills through the parliament, has not taken enough time to consider that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the parliament that the citrus industry has survived strong competition from other countries, including that posed by frozen orange juice concentrate from Brazil. The government seems to have just written off the future of this segment of the industry, particularly in South Australia and Victoria, because the whole of Senator Sherry's remarks were directed to the industry in Queensland. I point out that this industry has survived many challenges and will continue to provide jobs for Australians and export income. Not enough recognition was given in Senator Sherry's speech of the adjustments that have already taken place to make this industry very much more efficient. The industry will adapt to the challenges arising from this bill, but it will be costly and time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the very valuable contributions made by my colleague the member for Wakefield, Mr Neil Andrew, and by his National Party colleague in a neighbouring electorate, Mr John Forrest. They have identified the problem with the 10-year lag between tree planting and economic production. We just do not turn taps on and off. Mr Keating feels we pull levers to make things happen. It does not happen that way in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government package has ignored the recommendation of the horticultural task force that 100 per cent fruit juice be sales tax exempt, and rejected outright the proposal. This bill is going to have a very severe impact. I urge the government to give more consideration to the assistance package that it has so far offered the citrus industry. We ask that it give further consideration to the concept of a sales tax exemption for pure fruit juice, given that fruit is a natural food. It seems ironic that there is no sales tax on a pure orange, but as soon as it is squeezed and made into juice it becomes subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something wrong in the government's thinking in allowing a situation of this particular nature. We need a clarification of the depreciation write-offs so that, as soon as possible, the guys can decide whether it is worth continuing and adapting to the new environment created by this bill or whether they should actually close the gate. I call on the government to give these matters its very urgent consideration, giving weight to the fact that the citrus industry provides significant employment and export opportunities. It needs a fair go. </PARA>

In particular, I am pleased to reflect on the discussions I have had with the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr John Anderson, who is also the shadow minister for primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package, based on last year's breakthrough in GATT negotiations, heralds a new era for Australia's farmers, processors and manufacturers. The promise of fewer import restrictions, new market opportunities and renewed hope for Australia's agricultural industries means we can look forward to GATT benefits potentially worth $900 million a year. This is the chance efficient producers have been waiting for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new arrangements, producers will be free to unlock new markets, to develop their export potential and to enhance Australia's good reputation overseas. The federal government also has an important role in this new era. It must do everything in its power to give exporters a fighting chance on international markets. By that I mean lowering costs on production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that note, I wish to turn to the legislation. The Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 terminates the market support payments to the Australian dairy industry in order to comply with GATT. Currently, dairy farmers pay a levy on all milk. This acts as an incentive to export through payments on export products and effectively discourages producers and manufacturers from dumping product on the domestic market, causing the price to crash. The success of the levy is reflected in the industry's export performance. I am pleased that the government has announced plans to ensure that a GATT legal type of assistance will be available to the industry in the future. Figures show that the dairy industry exports more than $1 billion worth of product a year, a significant contribution to Australia's balance of trade, the national economy and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the horticultural industry and the impact of the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill on the citrus industry in particular. I note the comments Senator Watson has just made. Before GATT, a product containing 25 per cent or more by volume of Australian fruit juice had a sales tax rate of 11 per cent. By contrast, a product containing less than 25 per cent Australian fruit juice had a sales tax rate of 21 per cent. In light of Australia's commitment to new trade arrangements, this preference for Australian product cannot be sustained. Therefore, all juices or drinks containing at least 25 per cent actual juice, regardless of origin, will be taxed at 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the citrus industry is disappointed by this development. Over the years, the industry has survived a variety of threats from Brazilian frozen orange juice concentrate and now, as a result of this legislation, stands to lose its home-grown advantage. Brazil is a frontrunner in world juice production mainly because of its climatic conditions, specialisation in the citrus industry and efficient labour force and labour costs. On the world stage, Australia is not regarded as a significant citrus producer. We supply just over one per cent of total world production. Yet the industry is significant to the Australian economy through the domestic market, export income and regional employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note the report prepared by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on this legislation. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of citrus growers expressed concern that abolition of the local content arrangement would remove a stabilising influence on markets for juicing oranges in Australia. Other witnesses confirmed that the industry was efficient in production and use of technology. These advances were threatened by the potential loss of farm income and the loss of some varieties of citrus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to concerns that removal of the local content sales taxes would adversely affect the industry, the Minister advised the Committee that a submission by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy concerning transitional arrangements would be considered by the Government on 28 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 29 November 1994, the Government announced a package of reforms affecting the citrus industry which deal with, among other things, the removal of the local content sales taxes and the promotion of a market diversification program.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, John Anderson, has since described the package as miserly and an underestimation of the industry's potential and its need for restructuring. Turning to the recommendations, the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the concerns of the Liberal Party Senators representing the Coalition who have expressed their dissatisfaction at the inadequacy of the Government's response to the recommendations of the Horticultural Task Force and the problems faced by citrus growers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The gains brought about by GATT are expected to be significant. While efficient producers can look forward to such gains, the onus will be on the government to restructure the domestic taxation regime so that any hard won benefits are not eroded by existing taxes and imposts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Trade Marks Bill, the Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Customs Tariff (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and the Copyright (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill are a part of the whole evolution of what is happening in world trade at the moment. This year signifies a turning point in the global approach to trade barriers. The world is finally realising the follies of erecting high tariff walls in order to protect industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support all the points made by Senator Short in leading this debate for the opposition. He put the issues very succinctly so I will not take the time of the chamber for very long. The challenge is to make sure that all participating countries subscribe to the provisions they have signed themselves into. This assurance will demand a great deal of diplomacy, especially from those countries that have entered into the GATT with a little reluctance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is an indication of Australia's determination&mdash;I stress `determination'&mdash;to be at the forefront of world trade liberalisation. But being a leader in this area will take perseverance on the part of our political and industry leaders. However, as my colleague Mr Tim Fischer said in the other place, it is imperative that our leaders do not put Australia in a position where we are giving too much away in our bilateral trade negotiations. I am quite sure that, considering the pressure that will be put on the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), who is sitting at the table at the moment, he will make sure that happens. Everyone in Australia will be mindful of what he does about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan, the Minister for Trade, has said before that Australia will need to adjust to a much lesser degree than more protected countries. Given that fact, we must be careful not to place ourselves well ahead of the pack and suddenly find ourselves exposed to those who have not quite played the game as far as the GATT is concerned. The success of the GATT in a worldwide sense will depend on global cooperation and the ability to cross the finishing line together. Everyone has to be mindful of that and no-one wants to be left behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been rather disappointing in my view is the relatively slow response of other countries in ratifying the establishment of the World Trade Organisation. We received the good news yesterday that the United States House of Representatives passed the GATT bill with a substantial 288 to 146 majority. The real test, however, will be the vote in the American Senate tomorrow. Let us hope that sanity prevails and that the seven years of the Uruguay Round negotiations are not wasted because of a negative vote from the United States Senate. There is not much that I can say at this late stage that might influence those good people in the American Senate, except that I hope the bill will receive the same level of support there that I expect this chamber to give to our corresponding legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns within the citrus industry with regard to the changes in the sales tax regulations that this bill will impose. Senator Sherry made some points about that. Senator Short also made some very good points about that. Hopefully, people will understand the problems that some of those industries face. The coalition believes that the citrus industry can be compensated by taking note of the Industry Commission's recommendations in its report on the horticulture industry last year, something I believe the government has not done. It has blatantly failed to make sure that that industry is looked after. This is evident from what I said about Senator Sherry's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's responsibility to look into tax concessions for this industry so that new plantations receive more favourable tax treatment, as is enjoyed by investment in farm plant and equipment. I note the recommendations of the Economics Legislation Committee report, which was presented this morning by Senator Childs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the World Trade Organisation Amendment Bills and the provisions of the Copyright (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee notes the concerns of the Liberal Party Senators representing the Coalition who have expressed their dissatisfaction at the inadequacy of the Government's response to the recommendations of the Horticultural Task Force and the problems faced by the citrus growers.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is very important that the government take those recommendations on board. In the last decade the Labor government has shown that primary producers are one of the government's favourite milking cows when it comes to raising revenue. I hope that ceases in the future so that we can all&mdash;especially the farmers in Australia&mdash;get onto an even playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE has suggested that the value of exports will increase as a result of GATT by about $330 million in beef, $210 million in dairy products, $320 million in wheat, $50 million in coarse grains, $30 million in rice, $10 million in sugar, $1 billion in coal and something like $3 billion in industrial manufactures. Basically, if those things come through it will be an absolute boon to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this legislation is vital to the future viability of Australia's primary industries. It will be of benefit to Australia's primary industries if this Labor government does not slug all industries with increased taxes and higher interest charges and nullify any advantages which this legislation will bring to the Australian economy. I support the legislation but with the proviso that the government understands that if it is going to have a vital and viable primary industry in Australia it cannot now slug it with higher interest rates and with the extra taxes it is now contemplating, because that will nullify any advantages we get from the World Trade Organisation legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 and related bills. These bills amend Australian legislation to make it compatible with the GATT provisions which the Australian government has agreed to&mdash;without debate in parliament&mdash;in contrast to the very detailed debate that has been and is still being carried out in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever a treaty needed the approval of parliament and careful examination of its implications, it is this one. The Australian Democrats are very conscious of the benefits that these bills will bring for agricultural industries in particular in Australia. It is not before time that our farmers will be able to enter world markets so far closed to them due to the subsidy arrangements and other strategies employed by other countries. However, that advantage comes at a cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Democrats' position that these bills should be deferred until full, careful and detailed discussion of the consequences of these amendments has taken place in this parliament, and indeed in the community. It is for that reason that we will vote against the second reading of the bill. This is not to be taken as an expression that we do not support the advantages that will flow to our primary industries. What we are objecting to is the lack of debate on the consequences of the types of agreements that the Australian government has made on our behalf without careful and detailed consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns about these bills are raised at three different levels. First of all, there are the broad implications of the WTO agreement&mdash;for instance the impact on the Third World; the transparency, accountability and democratic processions of the new WTO, the implications for Australia's ability to promote international standards in the environmental, labour and human rights areas in the region, and the pressures which will be generated on Australia to lower its own standards in these areas under threat of greater unemployment; the direct injury to industries and groups arising from implementation of Australia's commitments under the WTO where those commitments are not embodied in the WTO legislation package which is now before the Senate; and, finally, the direct injury to industries and groups arising out of the WTO legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Trade Organisation will be a powerful institution. Those senators who worry about the sovereignty argument because an Australian citizen has gone before the United Nations Human Rights Committee to lay a complaint should look at this organisation. Australia will be unable to pass laws which discriminate between imported products on the basis of the production process used. It may well be `illegal' under the WTO agreement for Australia to place restrictions on imports produced using exploited child labour, despite Australia being a signatory to the ILO convention which calls for the elimination of such practices. It may well be illegal under the WTO agreement for Australia to give preference to imports which use environmentally clean technology, despite Australia's participation in any number of international environmental agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for Australian ownership of important Australian assets or Australian cultural industries could also be challengeable under the WTO agreement's foreign investment rules. Rules against foreign domination of the media, support for the Australian film industry, and local content rules for Australian television may all end up being challengeable through the WTO. I see that the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), who is at the table, shakes his head. I will be very glad of a refutation of that and an undertaking that it will not be the case. I did say `challengeable'; I did not say that it will be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Australian standards could come under threat. Any quarantine or food standards in excess of the minimum common standards defined under the WTO agreement would be challengeable as non-tariff barriers. Even steps taken to implement commitments under other international agreements could be challenged. It is even possible that a greenhouse targeted carbon tax could be challenged by oil or car exporting countries as a non-tariff barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given these sovereignty issues, it is of concern that the Senate is being asked to pass this legislation enabling the government to sign on to the WTO agreement when no framework for ensuring transparency, accountability and democratic processes within the WTO&mdash;and in Australia's relations with the WTO&mdash;have been specified to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International social justice aspects of the WTO agreement were also raised as a matter of concern before the Senate Economics Committee. By far the greatest share of the estimated benefits from the agreement accrue to richer countries. The elimination of agricultural subsidies, much as that will benefit us, is likely to push up food prices, hurting food-importing African countries. The TRIPS agreement restricts Third World access to technology transfer, while the WTO agreement guarantees easy access by the developed world to Third World resources and&mdash;through TRIMs and its relaxed foreign investment regime&mdash;to cheap Third World labour. We all know how many of our companies are transferring their operations offshore, depriving Australians of jobs and exploiting cheap labour in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, southern China and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within Australia, we have free trade between states and regions and cities without internal tariffs or barriers to that trade. In that sense, it is indeed free trade. But it is not unregulated trade. We insist that production in Australia conform to certain minimum standards. We insist that workers are paid a basic living wage. Workers' health and safety is protected by regulations. There are stringent environmental standards and practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such regulation represents an imposition of values on otherwise amoral markets. The WTO agreement does not include any social clauses on labour or environmental standards. It is well documented that free trade regimes can lead to a `race to the bottom' as countries compete to become low cost producers by relaxing such standards. It can lead, and has led, to appalling worker exploitation and environmental disasters in Third World countries, and we are becoming part of that exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these trends, American Professor Paul Romer has pointed out that free trade between countries at different stages of development can lead to uneven and inequitable growth. Resources are diverted towards chasing cheap labour instead of being invested in new, sustainable, knowledge based industries, which Romer's new growth theory argues are the source of improved wellbeing. Equity and fairness demand that these issues be investigated and considered by the Senate prior to passing the WTO legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the specific area of losers under the WTO agreement as far as Australia is concerned. The government has claimed that the World Trade Organisation agreement will yield benefits to Australia of over $4 billion. If this claim is correct&mdash;and I trust and hope that it is&mdash;then simple fairness demands that no Australian should be allowed to be made worse off by the implementation of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examination of the issues by the Senate Economics Committee revealed that there are a number of groups within the community who will lose out as a result of the WTO agreement. They include, amongst others, fruit growers, in particular citrus growers, vegetable growers, egg producers, pork producers, tobacco growers, video game rental businesses and consumers, and compact disk rental businesses and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the negative impacts of the WTO agreement are not embodied in the package of legislation referred to the economics committee. Among these are the likely devastation of Australia's tobacco by GATT related changes to market support arrangements. Clearly, the tobacco growers must be assisted in switching to different products. We are living in an age where we are extolling the virtues of giving up smoking and of stopping the advertising of tobacco. But the people who have derived their living from that industry must be assisted to work in other industries and to grow other products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased risks are faced by the egg, poultry and pork producers due to the likely relaxation of Australia's quarantine standards, and workers and businesses in the textile, clothing and footwear industries will continue to suffer from the excessively fast reduction of tariff protection which the government has already foreshadowed. Not only will many manufacturing industries go, but small agricultural producers and producers of fruit and vegetables will be affected by the trade related investment measures which will give transnationals and other large companies increased control over diversified markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the large monoculture sectors of agriculture are likely to see any real advantage, although, if commodity prices fall, that advantage may not be great. This will also work against ecologically sustainable agriculture by making diversification less attractive. In each of these cases, we urge the government to take steps to ease adjustments, to compensate or to introduce safeguards to protect these and other industries adversely affected by Australia's implementation of GATT agreements. Senate consideration of the WTO legislative package, I repeat, should be deferred until details of the government programs to assist WTO agreement losers are available, and available at reasonable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the WTO bills referred to the Economics Committee to investigate, we have particular concerns with four as a result of listening to the people and the industries affected by them: the sales tax bill, the copyright bill, the patents bill and, to a lesser extent, the customs legislation. Turning to the sales tax bill, it is clear that the abolition of the sales tax incentive for local content in fruit and vegetable juices and drinks will have a crippling impact on Australian citrus growers. Even from submissions and witnesses supporting the legislation, it was apparent that the effect would be to drive down prices for juicing oranges on the domestic market, hastening industry rationalisation as the government drives citrus growers off the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This price pressure would be likely to have flow-on effects on the domestic whole fruit and export markets. Hundreds of currently marginally viable citrus growers will face likely bankruptcy. The witness representing Women in Horticulture attested to the likely social impacts in the citrus areas of the Riverland and Sunraysia. She spoke of likely increases in family breakdown and separation, suicides, domestic violence, the risks to rural children, the lack of job opportunities, the loss within communities of the spirit of helpfulness and assistance, and the threat to the level and quality of services provided in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the drafting of the bill, too much emphasis has been placed on GATT consistency and, clearly, not enough has been placed on these social costs. No convincing argument was put to the committee that Australia's sales tax regime should provide an exemption for milk, tea and coffee but not for fruit and vegetable juices. The Australian Democrats favour exemption for the superior, fresh style `not from concentrate' product. A tax exemption for `not from concentrate' juice is clearly justifiable in encouraging nutrition and providing better access for low income consumers to the higher quality product, both allowable under GATT. The incidental price support that it gives to Australian fruit will help to ameliorate the impacts described above and pales in comparison with support provided to similar industries in the United States, Brazil and Japan, as described to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's position that the Democrats' exemption would not be GATT consistent on the basis that reconstituted juice and fresh style juice are like products is a symptom of the government's overzealousness in wishing to appear lily white in international trade fora. If the position we adopt would have to be challenged by others, why do we not go in to bat for our growers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The products are clearly different. They have a different flavour and texture, they are customarily labelled to enable consumers to distinguish between them, and the distinction between the products is a major marketing point. The higher quality product is sold at a premium, which would not be possible if the products were not significantly different. In any case, there is no reason in my view not to move towards the protection of our own industries and let others challenge it. The Democrats recommend that the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill be amended to exempt 100 per cent `not from concentrate' fruit and vegetable juices from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the next most important bill: the Copyright (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994. As called for by the TRIPS agreement of the GATT, this bill provides an exclusive right to enter into commercial rental agreements to the copyright holders on sound recordings and computer programs. This is laudable in so far as it will help to ensure appropriate rewards to performers and programmers for dealings in their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is also a drawback to such an exclusive right: it grants monopoly control to the copyright holder without any restrictions on the possible abuse of that monopoly power. It also avoids the question of whether the actual programmers and artists see any substantial benefit, and whether the monopoly prices companies can demand reflect actual costs and reasonable royalties or corporate superprofits. Evidence presented to the committee suggests there is a likelihood that, in the areas of video game cartridges and CDs, copyright holders will withdraw these products from the rental market, destroying the businesses concerned, but just as importantly will be withdrawing an avenue of cost-effective use by consumers from the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is possible simultaneously to achieve the objectives of reward to copyright holders, protection of existing legitimate businesses and consumer access to a rental market. Rental operators should have a right to continue to rent out CDs and video games provided they pay a fair level of royalty. In the case of video game cartridges, legal technicalities raised in the Blockbuster Australia submission suggest that it would be possible to exclude video game cartridges from this copyright legislation by deleting certain proposed sections of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of CDs, the negligent failure by the government to set up a system of equitable remuneration to copyright holders prior to April 1994 means that it is too late to introduce such a compulsory licensing scheme. We urge that Australian law include an exemption for rental operators. If no such licensing scheme is put in place, it will then be up to negotiators to assure that there is no problem if we wish to join the WTO. There is no intrinsic problem since the United States, Canada and Japan have all had such compulsory licensing schemes. The matters I have raised are only some of those which cause concern which all add up to the main overriding argument that the government has made agreements on behalf of the Australian people without consulting parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free trade substitutes one form of regulation for another. Regulated trade imposes massive costs both in terms of restricting the ability of nations and their citizens to determine their own affairs and in terms of subverting global ecosystems. The notion of free trade begs the question: free for whom and free from what? There is very little about free trade that is free. In fact, there are massive costs. Free trade is anything but free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So-called free trade substitutes one form of regulation for another, as I have said. International regulation is replacing national regulation and regulation according to the principles of laissez faire supplants regulation according to democratically determined national interests, including, most especially, environmental and conservation interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the international community agreed, in a rather loose way, to conduct trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. No formal organisation existed to oversee these agreements. GATT operated in an entirely ad hoc way. The Uruguay Round of trade talks changed all of this. Participants&mdash;and they included most countries of the world, including all the main trading countries&mdash;agreed to formalise world trade according to strict rules. These rules derived from the ideas of laissez faire. Regulated trade, according to the principles of laissez faire, is still regulation. It is regulation in the interests of international corporations and the most powerful nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new regulations permit corporations and large nations to impose their aspirations, their tastes and their way of life over the entire globe to an extent not possible when individual nations and their citizens determine their own affairs. I am really surprised and appalled that the opposition, when it continually raises concerns about international treaties, is seemingly going along with this trend so easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that trading countries adhere to the new regulations, the Uruguay Round established a multilateral trade organisation, the World Trade Organisation. Based in Geneva, the WTO's function is to decide what rules should govern world trade. The WTO does not exist to expand freedom; on the contrary, the new regulatory regime will fundamentally alter the relationship between citizen and state. Once in operation, WTO decisions will devastate sovereign domestic decision making. Every WTO ruling that affects Australia, for example, will be in effect a change to Australian law without reference to the people or the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal coalition has recently expressed concern that Australia's signature on international agreements usurps the democratic obligation of parliament to decide Australia's best interests. It has gone so far as to call on the federal government not to sign any more such agreements. We agree. We do not think we should be going ahead with these bills at this point. We do not want Australia's signature placed on these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, we support some, but not all, of the opposition's arguments. But the international treaties that govern the opposition's concerns are minor and trivial in comparison with the obligation required of Australia under this Uruguay Round of agreements. The opposition and its media confederates are conspicuously silent on these very real and pressing threats to Australia's democratic institutions. In fact, they appear to favour the new international rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us ask ourselves why. Is it possible that the opposition and the media represent interests likely to benefit from the new international regime? Those benefits will be gained at the expense of the people and the land of Australia. Trade conducted under WTO guidelines will trespass on and override locally made decisions about life and our ecosystems. When far-off people and bodies make and enforce such decisions, local people and bodies can no longer affect them. Without direct participation in decision making, people's lives and the environment will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deprived of the means to control our own trading relations, our nation and other nations are forced to compete for economic benefits by allowing themselves to be easily exploited. Under the new tailor-made arrangements, corporations will invest only in those countries that offer low wages and low tax as well as minimal labour, health and environmental regulation. Corporations will also favour those countries that subsidise power, roads and water. The net effect will be a ratcheting down of standards around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economists, businessmen and politicians all laud the virtues of reregulated trade. They believe that the application of laissez faire rules will break down trade barriers, increase global trade and benefit us all. But increased global trade can also be translated to mean increased pressure on global ecosystems. Increased global trade means higher levels of toxic pollution due to more manufacturing in areas with fewer environmental controls. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Increased global trade means the production of cash crops for export instead of domestic consumption. Increased global trade means growing unemployment in countries that companies leave for cheaper havens. Reregulated trade allows transnational companies to operate wherever they can gain a greater profit. Profits depend on costs, and costs depend on wages, taxes, social security charges and environmental regulations. The highest absolute profit will be determined by the lowest absolute costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If companies can make things cheaper by, for example, employing child labour, companies will locate to where they can take advantage of child labour. If companies can make things cheaper by paying wages that allow bare subsistence in return for 12 or more hours work per day, companies will locate to where they can pay those subsistence wages. If companies can make things cheaper by leaving wastes untreated, by dumping them in a local river or outside the factory gates, and if they can get local communities to subsidise their arrangements, companies will locate to where there are minimal or no environmental standards. Their production and their waste disposal arrangements will then be effectively and exploitatively subsidised by the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new trading arrangements enable companies to site anywhere and sell anywhere, and send profits where they wish. Corporations will be able to buy labour in the low wage markets and sell their products in the remaining high wage, high income markets. The larger the market, the longer a corporation will be able to avoid the logic of Henry Ford, who realised that he had to pay his workers enough for them to be able to buy his cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When track shoes became a designer item, production shifted to Indonesia and the Philippines. Made for a few dollars a pair in one market, the shoes continue to be sold at over $100 a pair in another. The global economy enabled track shoe companies to separate production from consumption. Competition will not lower this price. Track shoe companies dictate prices through the control of market share. They market in supermarkets, department stores and specialty shops. They dominate advertising. If necessary, they can reduce their profit to rid themselves of competition from any but a few companies in a similar position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Global corporations do not compete through price. They prefer to capture market share through product differential, styling and marketing campaigns. Not only do large corporations control market share; they also structure and control the market itself. Let us look at bananas and steel. Chiquita, formerly United Fruit, now controls Australian banana production. Queensland bananas used to be produced by locally based family businesses who grew a wide variety of bananas. Now, half of all growers produce one specialist variety for Chiquita. They have no choice. Chiquita is the dominant buyer and wholesaler of bananas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restriction and regulation of nations in their trade dealings will make them vulnerable to transnational manipulation. Corporations, not sovereign states, will decide what is best produced in any given country and at what price. For example, a few years ago steel producers told Australia that, unless it lowered iron ore prices, they would buy from Brazil. They then turned to Brazil and announced that, unless Brazil dropped its price, they would buy from Australia. The result was a ratcheting down of returns for ore producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the price for iron ore dropped by six per cent. In 1993 it dropped by 10 per cent. Steel producers argue it should drop another 10 per cent in 1994. Brazil cannot afford another price drop. The country is burdened with a massive debt. It attempts to meet that debt through the ferocious exploitation of national resources but the strategy is not paying off. The price of commodities is low and falling. Other countries in Latin America and Africa are in the same situation, attempting to meet debt payments through the exploitation and export of national resources. The net effect is general impoverishment. Such are the consequences of re-regulated trade. Corporations benefit at the expense of nations and their citizens. This is not surprising. The new rules are designed precisely with that end in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased corporate profit does not need to arise from investment in production. In fact, the most spectacular profit opportunities arise out of the new rules that govern the flow of capital between and within nations. As in other areas of re-regulated trade, new capital and banking rules restrict national democratic freedoms while simultaneously enlarging the possibilities for transnationals. Only a fraction, perhaps only 10 per cent, of the $1,875 billion exchanged each day on the world's currency markets is now used for facilitating trade. The rest is traded for risk management or profit. Speculative profits do, however, have real effects. Profits from speculation set the profit levels needed to ensure investment. Unless profits approach the levels generated by money market speculation, then there is no incentive to invest. Only lower standards, lower wages, taxes and environment regulation can guarantee profits from investment that will match those returned through speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> GATT proponents believe the new trading rules will stimulate more international trade. Yet more trade brings more of the problems the world needs less of&mdash;uneven spread of employment, widening gaps between rich and poor and degradation of global ecosystems. To deliberately increase trade is to add insult to environmental injury. Trade already degrades the planet. Regulation designed to increase trade would be an incentive to greater harm. By expanding markets, trade increases the polluting and toxic effects of extraction, production and disposal. In a country committed to competing in the international market, local and national endeavours to conserve resources and preserve ecosystems will fail. Pressures to compete will nullify and overwhelm efforts to conserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world needs less, not more, international trade. There must be less physical transfer of goods around the world. Much trade is ecological madness. Ships traverse the globe passing others carrying similar goods or goods that could be produced locally going the other way. In 1992 the GATT secretariat argued that re-regulating trade according to the precepts of laissez faire would enhance environment protection. The less control individual nations have over trade, the greater will be the economic activity between nations. The increased wealth could be used to clean up the environment, which was necessarily damaged by the first burst of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such assertions are now part of the common wisdom. Their logic urgently requires questioning. Actually, there is not much logic to deconstruct. The defence of re-regulated commerce is not so much reasoned argument as a revelation of self-interest and ignorance, a self-serving misunderstanding, both of history and of biology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere in the world, the real world of limits, has growth caused a lessening of ecological degradation. Quite the reverse. Growth increases environmental costs faster than benefits from production, thereby making us all poorer, not richer. Growth in income and growth in numbers put unsustainable pressure on a finite planet. Thus the real danger to the earth's ecosystem will come from the successful working of reregulated trade. The international movement of capital will globalise environmental problems that are local at present and are, at least theoretically, locally manageable. Reregulated trade will also globalise the Western consumerist way of life. It is this way of living that is overwhelming life on the planet. Do we really want to export this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, free trade and market economics are public relations terms. They are designed to conceal what they really stand for: the forced abandonment of local controls on development, ownership, trade, wages, prices and lifestyle in favour of centrally conceived concepts and interests protected by bureaucracies in Geneva or Brussels. The social benefits that people value&mdash;health, insurance, safety standards and a reasonable minimum standard of living for all citizens&mdash;came from national policies not from global economic integration. Free trade is a recipe for national disintegration and international environmental collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens urge our colleagues in this chamber to think twice about proceeding along the path that they seem determined to follow. We need to revalue the things that are of importance within our community that give our global ecosystem some remnants of integrity and protection. We urge people to strongly consider, amend, change these bills or, better still, defer them completely so that we can assess the more subtle implications and unintended dramatic consequences&mdash;at least unintended by some&mdash;that may ensue to the detriment of this country if we fail to study the impact of the legislation before us in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of World Trade Organisation bills is one of the most important to come before this chamber. It will have unforeseen ramifications. The package of bills is fundamental to the importance of Australia and is of fundamental importance to the whole of Australia, yet it is being rushed through this parliament. If ever there were a need to further consider the ramifications and implications of any bill, it is now with these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should at least have a look at the minority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and give further consideration to the matters that have been raised in that. I am sure that honourable senators will agree that this minority report has identified very key questions which need consideration. People come to these questions from different backgrounds, but very often they still reach the same conclusions. If fair-minded senators were to look at the propositions contained in the minority report, I believe they would agree on most of them. The minority report indicated the various concerns raised at the hearings and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns raised were at three different `levels':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)broad implications of the WTO Agreement, eg: the impact on the Third World; the transparency, accountability and democratic processes of the new WTO; implications for Australia's ability to promote international standards (environmental, labour, human rights) in the region; and the pressures which will be generated on Australia to lower its own standards in these areas under threat of greater unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was an essential question for the government to examine further. No doubt the government has examined that question, but I believe that the implications have not hit the consciousness of the trade union movement in general. Certainly, some people in the ACTU have been considering the matter for some time, but I do not think the implications have yet filtered through to the rank and file. The second concern in the minority report is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) direct injury to industries and groups arising from implementation of Australia's commitments under the WTO where those commitments are not embodied in the WTO legislation package before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>The third concern is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)direct injury to industries and groups arising out of the WTO legislation package.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had discussions about this matter in the chamber. Unfortunately, I have not been here for the whole of this debate because of the decision of the Senate to allow the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a participating member, to hold a public hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us leave aside the trade union movement. What about the Business Council of Australia? The government appears to have made only a limited response to the calls by the Business Council of Australia for a genuine level playing field for exporters and producers. What we are allegedly talking about in this package is a world-wide level playing field. We all know that that is not the case. We are hopeful that it may ultimately be the case at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that other countries give tax relief to farmers, dairy producers, citrus growers, manufacturers and others with respect to indirect taxes on their costs of production. The Business Council has asked for similar tax relief for Australian producers with respect to indirect taxes such as sales tax and fuel excise, which is one of the problems confronting the citrus industry. I do not believe&mdash;nor does the Business Council&mdash;that the government has adequately responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some suggestion that such tax relief for Australian exporters would be GATT inconsistent, but neither the government nor anybody else has produced any legal reason why Australia cannot give tax relief to exporters in order to achieve the level playing field enjoyed by countries with value added tax refund regimes for exports. The government has to consider that very carefully. I would like to hear the response of the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) to that question. It is of great importance to those of us, including those in the government, who are very concerned about Australia's industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill on citrus growers has been canvassed, but I would like to put in my two bob's worth. As a consumer and as a person with a family, I do not believe there is any justification for increasing the sales tax on citrus products. Food is exempt from sales tax, so why is not orange juice? The justice of an 11 per cent sales tax on orange juice is dependent on whether fresh fruit juice is a food in the same grouping as tea, coffee and milk or a beverage with closer affinity to alcoholic drinks, et cetera. If it is a food and the tax is applied, it will stand alone as the only food bearing sales tax. This should be anathema to the government that denounced the opposition's proposal for a GST on all purchases including food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no tax on fruit, but there is the intention in this legislation to tax fruit juice. It is illogical. A tax on fruit juice is a GST on food. That is no getting away from that. A GST, if it is applied to food, should not be selective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian citrus industry has experienced major reductions in government support since the May 1988 economic summit. The tariff on imported juice concentrate has been progressively reduced from 30 per cent ad valorem&mdash;25 per cent for developing countries, including Brazil&mdash;and will fall to five per cent by 1996 and zero for developing countries. The pace of this adjustment is not matched by other influences on profitability, for example, in transport and shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry, the chairperson of the government's horticultural task force, recommended that juice bearing the label `not from concentrate orange juice' be exempt from sales tax to encourage the growth of the fresh fruit sector. This proposal was rejected on the ground that it would result in preferential treatment for Australian juice and was judged to be GATT inconsistent. The industry accepted that the exemption should apply to fruit from all sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's fervour in interpreting the GATT is in sharp contrast to that of our major trade partners in Europe, Japan and the United States of America. Other signatories continue to defend their markets and support their industries to the maximum tolerance and employ effective non-tariff exclusion methods. I support the thrust of the efforts of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation to preclude this inequitable tax. I recognise the impact that this will have in setting a precedent and I recognise the flow-on effect it will have on Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with patents. There are a lot of areas that I would like to deal with and there may be a brief opportunity in the committee stage for this to occur. The extension of patent protection contained in this package needs to be questioned. There is serious doubt whether patents encourage innovation or suppress innovation. Britain went through the Industrial Revolution without the need for patent laws, which were opposed by many manufacturers until their 19th century introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Knowledge is not like physical goods such as clothes. Private property rights are not necessary to prevent destruction of the resource by overuse. On the contrary, knowledge grows by being shared. Isaac Newton said he could not have seen so far had he not stood on the shoulders of giants. The extension of patent protection is potentially contrary to the micro-economic reform which is directed at open access to essential infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are looking at breaking down the public utility monopolies to encourage growth of industry and commerce, why are we creating stronger patent monopolies? On the one hand, we are suggesting that there should be a decrease in monopoly power and a breaking down of public utility monopolies to encourage industry and, on the other hand, we are creating stronger patent monopolies. Many of the benefits will flow into the pockets of United States companies and other multinational companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What rational basis is there for this? The Industry Commission has already pointed out how registered designs can be used to create a monopoly in the market for motor car spares. The field for abuse of patents is much greater. Why is it in Australia's national interest to give greater protection for foreign patent holders to levy royalties in the Australian community? Under this package that is what we are doing; we are giving foreign patent holders greater protection. What guarantees are there that technology or drugs will be made available to Australians at reasonable prices by overseas patent holders? It is a very important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse&mdash;we will eventually be locked into recognising the growth of patents in areas touching life itself. Already patents have been granted for seeds. Patents are being litigated for diseases such as hepatitis C. It is absurd that any human being can claim right of ownership over such things. Why should the world have to pay a tax to anyone in the search for a cure for a disease? There needs to be an incentive for research in these areas, but should it have to rely so much on the patent area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must raise this question, too, which I ask the minister to respond to specifically. The Senate will recall that some years ago this chamber amended the patents legislation to provide that certain types of patents relating to certain human life forms would not be able to be patented under Australian laws. My question to the minister&mdash;and I hope that he responds to it&mdash;is this: what effect will this package have on the integrity of that law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole range of ramifications and implications of this legislation have not been thought through. As I indicated in opening, the minority report has identified some of them. I invite honourable senators, with an open mind, to examine them and ask themselves whether or not we need a little extra time to consider this package of legislation. It is a very important package. I for one would be prepared to put aside a lot of the other matters that are causing pressure on my time to devote myself to this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the matter did go off to the Economics Legislation Committee, but only a very short time was devoted to it because of the pressure of business at this time of year. That is a problem&mdash;although not entirely the government's fault, I acknowledge. I ask the minister to consider whether we need to carry these measures now. I am not saying that there should not be the general thrust of a fair trading system; that is what we are all after. I do not know whether we will solve the question of whether it is a level playing field in the time for which I am suggesting that we delay this measure, but it is a question that we need to have a good look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I am talking now from Tasmania's point of view; I am sure you will appreciate this. Our dairy industry and other industries are substantially affected by taxes which industries in a number of other countries are not affected by. Off the top of my head, I mention payroll tax. I am not sure about that one; I will leave it hanging for the time being. Certain other taxes that I can think of apply to our industries but do not apply to industries in countries with which we are competing. Industries in a number of countries with which we compete have subsidies and supports which our industries do not have. I am talking about the situation which applies in Australia, particularly to the very important dairy industry in Tasmania. I would hope the government and the opposition will see their way clear to supporting a deferral of this package until such time as its ramifications can be thoroughly investigated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all senators who contributed to this debate on the World Trade Organisation bills. It is a debate which has significant implications and it was therefore appropriate that a number of senators raised the diverse views which they did. When we look at the detail of the legislation, we find that it is actually quite a modest package. The implications are quite major. But many of the things about which people spoke relate to changes that were made long since in Australia by other legislation passed in this parliament. People's concerns about what our level of tariffs should be in protecting various industries is all water under the bridge. People in this chamber have different views about it, but it is not affected by this package. So it is a relatively modest package in its immediate effect, although its implications are significant in terms of Australia's ability to fulfil the requirements to join the World Trade Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not have time to deal with all the detailed issues that senators raised. I attended the chamber for almost every minute of the debate and listened to the contributions people made but, in the time available to me, I will not be able to respond to all of the issues that were raised. I want to seek to deal with the key issues that people raised about whether or not the bill should be supported. Those issues go to the questions of why we have to do this now, whether we have had sufficient time and whether, on the balance of interests, it is in Australia's interests so to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a new issue in Australian public debate. The debate about the extension of free trade, the move towards global trade liberalisation, has been an issue in Australian public debate at least since the inauguration of the Uruguay Round of 1986. Australia has been taking unilateral trade liberalisation initiatives for domestic reasons. This has not been driven by external imperatives, because there was no certainty that these matters would ever come to fruition in terms of the satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Once again, not everybody in this chamber supports all those measures, but they were taken as matters of domestic policy by the Australian government; they were not matters driven by this initiative. So this has been going on for a long time. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, in its detail, has been available for six weeks. It has been debated extensively in the House. It has been to a Senate committee and has been given extensive consideration. I do not think anybody can claim that they have been taken by surprise. It is quite clear from this debate that the overwhelming majority of senators&mdash;not all&mdash;have formed a view, on balance, about the merits of proceeding with this legislation, and they have decided that we should so proceed. Of course, I concur with that view. That is why the government has introduced the legislation. So it is clear that that is the prevailing view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at why we are doing this, I do not want to get into an esoteric debate about whether we should be exporting Western consumerism or whether trade degrades the planet. Those sorts of issues that were raised in a broad or philosophical attack on this proposal can be debated at some other time. It might be interesting, but it does not advance our debate about this legislation very far. I think what we need to do in thoughtful analysis of this&mdash;and people have raised thoughtful issues&mdash;is look at not only the consequence of taking this action but also the consequence of failing to take this action. What would happen if Australia did not pass this legislation? The benefits that could flow to Australian industry from participation in this freer global trading system would not necessarily be available to us because we would not be a contracting party to the Would Trade Organisation and there would be no obligation on people to extend to us the benefits that they do to contracting parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious problem then lies with our agricultural industry, which everybody acknowledges will be the big winner out of this. We should not forget that the tariffs confronting our manufactured industries will fall by 50 per cent as a result of the application of the Uruguay Round. That means substantial benefit&mdash;jobs for Australians&mdash;in many areas of this country. People would love to think that as a result of our reduction in tariffs our manufacturing production had collapsed and then all their conspiracy theories would be justified. The problem is that in the period we have been reducing our tariffs, notwithstanding a domestic and global recession, manufacturing output has gone up. I know some honourable senators wish that were not true because it does not suit their conspiracy theory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pipeline Legislation Amendment Bill will make a number of technical amendments to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 and the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, which received royal assent on 10 June 1994, provided the legislative framework for the sale of the pipeline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to briefly revisit that debate. The sale of the $550 million Moomba-Sydney pipeline has been a long, drawn out and complicated process. Five years have elapsed since the government announced its intention to sell the Pipeline Authority, and it is now 10 years since the coalition first called on the government to take this course of action. The 1,300-kilometre Moomba-Sydney pipeline transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin in South Australia for the Australian Gas Light Co.&mdash;known as AGL&mdash;for distribution in Sydney, Canberra and regional centres in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After several years of discussion, conditional sale of 51 per cent of the pipeline to AGL was negotiated by the government in December 1993. The remaining 49 per cent interest was eventually sold to a consortium headed by Canada's Novacorp International and Malaysia's state owned Petronas. As stated in the bill's explanatory memorandum, at the time of the pipeline sale a number of ambiguities in the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill were revealed. However, time constraints precluded these amendments from being made prior to the passage of the sale legislation through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns were then raised by both the New South Wales and the Queensland governments about the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. The New South Wales Solicitor-General held the view that the Commonwealth sale legislation, as it stood, could have acted to prevent state licensing laws from applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest. In order to allay those fears and concerns raised by the states, the federal government agreed to introduce the necessary amendments, those contained in part 2 of this bill, to ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments contained in this bill relate to a pipeline project that will bring ethane for use as a feedstock to a plastics manufacturing plant owned by ICI. The Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements for ICI to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia, through Queensland, to Botany in New South Wales. The amendments will facilitate the transfer of certain easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pipeline Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 has no financial impact.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 by including in it the agreement signed by Australia and New Zealand in July of this year. Australia has had a social security agreement with New Zealand since 1943 and has similar agreements with no fewer than 10 other countries. New Zealanders enjoy a unique immigration status in Australia and are eligible to be paid full pensions by the Australian government. Australians travelling to New Zealand are, of course, entitled to reciprocal benefits in that country. However, there is a $500 million imbalance in this relationship each year to Australia's detriment, an imbalance which has become particularly marked since the mid-1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was against this backdrop that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) travelled to New Zealand in May last year. He was a man on a mission. The Prime Minister was going to be the sharp negotiator and win back $70 million or $80 million for Australia. Not surprisingly, the reality fell far short of those great expectations and provides further evidence of this government's flair for overestimating its own capabilities. Every time we get an estimate, especially from Social Security, it is way out. Again, in this case, it was way out and the Prime Minister's estimates were way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreement, New Zealand will reimburse Australia the pensions Australia pays to persons formerly from New Zealand who have spent less than 10 years&mdash;after the age of 16 in the case of the age pension&mdash;of their working lives in Australia and who arrived after 1 January 1983. This agreement takes effect on 1 January 1995, but we will not see full reimbursement for some five years after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensions paid after 1 January 1995 will be reimbursed in full, provided they meet the relevant criteria; but reimbursement of pensions paid between 1983 and 1995 will be phased in over five years. We will see only 15 per cent reimbursement in the first year, 40 per cent in the second, 60 per cent in the third, 80 per cent in the fourth and, finally, 100 per cent in the fifth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full amount of the pension actually paid will not always be reimbursed. To determine the rate of reimbursement for a given pension, a formula is applied which is intended to reflect the relative proportions of a person's working life spent in each country. The only benefits which are reimbursable under the agreement are pensions and additional family payments when paid to recipients of pensions. Unemployment benefits and basic family payments are excluded from the ambit of the agreement. Sole parent pensions are reimbursable only when they have been paid for 12 months or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum to this bill puts estimated savings in the first year at $2 million; the second year, at $16.7 million; and the third year, at $34.2 million. These estimated savings add up to $52.9 million, well short of the $70 million to $80 million the Prime Minister has led us to believe would be gained. What is more, we get this figure only after three years and not immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, New Zealand contributes around $18 million of the $500 million Australia pays each year to former New Zealand residents. It is a perversion of the facts to state, as Mrs Crosio did in her speech during the second reading debate in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reimbursements by New Zealand to Australia are likely to triple over the next three years and then rise to around $90 million a year. . .</PARA>
<PARA>If Mrs Crosio is to be believed, we should be expecting New Zealand's contribution to increase from $18 million to $54 million yet, even on the government's figures, savings of $52 million will occur only after three years and are cumulative over that period. The mention, I would suggest, of $90 million is equally shaky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, all of this raises serious concerns about the Prime Minister's clout in international relationships and negotiations. We do not oppose this bill, because it goes some way towards redressing the imbalance which unarguably exists, and it is, apparently, the best this government can do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to be able to speak on this legislation. Today we are cognately debating two social security bills. The first is the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill amends the existing agreement between Australia and New Zealand relating to the reimbursement of pensions paid in the respective countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the House of Representatives debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) said that taxpayers would eventually be saving $60 million a year from these new arrangements. The Democrats certainly welcome this agreement because, for the first time since I have been in this place, a measure that is going to save the government money within the social security portfolio is not going to disadvantage any of the department's clients. That is a welcome departure from the norm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bill before us is the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994. As its name suggests, it introduces reforms that were announced in either the government's white paper on employment opportunities or in the following 1994 budget. Let me say at the outset that the Democrats will be supporting this bill. I would like to restrict my comments on this bill to just a number of its measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like to look at the amendment which allows additional family payment to be paid for 13 weeks where the child's parent or parents travel overseas. At the moment, if a parent goes overseas, additional family payments can continue to be paid only if the child and the person's partner remain in Australia. Obviously, this provision discriminates against sole parents, who currently lose their entitlement to additional family payment as soon as they leave the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are pleased to see these amendments brought on, because we feel that it is essential that any provisions discriminating against sole parents, be they in social security or any other legislation, must be removed as a priority. This amendment will benefit around 500 families, including both sole parent families and couples with children, and we will be supporting this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are disappointed, however, that the amendments do not go even further and allow payments to continue even when the child travels overseas. In most cases, a family would travel together and the requirement that the child stay at home to continue to get its additional family payment seems unjust. This is particularly true in this the International Year of the Family, given that we are talking here about families whose incomes are low enough for them to be eligible for the additional family payment. I indicate that I will be pursuing this in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure in this bill that I want to discuss is the extension of activities allowable under jobsearch and newstart activity agreements. At the moment, the Department of Social Security imposes very tight restrictions on the amount and types of activities unemployed people can undertake. The government's justification for this has always been that the unemployed should be primarily involved in undertaking jobsearch activities and that anything else is merely a distraction from that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always felt that, by restricting activities such as voluntary work, the government has taken a blinkered view of the way in which people can best re-enter the work force. I might add that my wife, who works in a nursing home, has encouraged many people to volunteer for work in the nursing home, and most of those people have subsequently been employed. That illustrates what we have been trying to get adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, however, has simply assumed that the best a person can do is to front up to two employers each and every fortnight and ask for a job. Of course, enormous resources have been allocated to policing this policy, and there are hefty penalties for those who are deemed not to have fulfilled their activity test requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tight restrictions on allowable activities have totally ignored the very valuable role that something like voluntary work&mdash;as I have just illustrated&mdash;can play in maintaining a person's self-esteem, enhancing his or her skills and maintaining his or her links with the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further complicate things, there has been considerable confusion not only amongst the unemployed but also amongst some DSS and CES staff over just how much voluntary work is currently permitted. As a result of that confusion, many unemployed people have played it safe and have actually refused offers of voluntary work for fear of losing their benefit. That seems to me to be not only to the disadvantage of their future prospects but also to the disadvantage of the country as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the activity test allows up to 20 hours a week, provided the work does not interfere with the unemployed person's jobsearch activity. This proviso has been interpreted in various ways by local offices. Indeed, I have been told that one of the Brisbane offices has been advising people that they can do only five hours a week voluntary work without interfering with their jobsearch efforts. Such is the confusion not only of clients but also of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe, and we have long argued, that unemployed people should be able to undertake up to 32 hours a week voluntary work without risk to their income support payments. We also believe that a person doing more than 10 hours a week voluntary work with a DEET approved non-profit, non-government organisation should be exempted from the activity test for that week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we believe an allowance should be paid to people undertaking voluntary work to assist them in covering the costs associated with that work. I need to stress that this would not be some sort of incentive payment to people over and above their jobsearch or newstart payment. It would simply be to offset the transport and other costs which are inevitably incurred when someone undertakes volunteer work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be supporting the extension of allowable activities proposed in this bill, but I really think the government needs to give far more thought to the whole idea of activity testing and to the activities that are allowable under that test for all unemployed people, particularly in the current climate of what is still relatively high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third set of measures in this bill that I want to discuss are the changes to the operation of the liquid assets test that applies to jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances. The most important of these changes is that the current four-week liquid assets waiting period will now have to be served only once in any 12-month period. The Democrats have been calling for the reduction or abolition of many social security waiting periods, including this one, for many years now. When we look at the liquid assets test, we need to remember that the average length of time a person is unemployed is currently over 60 weeks. For more than a year, unemployed people are forced to survive on a payment which is well below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the 60 weeks is only an average, it means that a large body of people are having to survive much longer periods on income support payments. Under these circumstances, the $5,000 that single people are allowed under the liquid assets test and the $10,000 that couples are allowed would be eaten up pretty quickly. Of course, the other factor we need to consider with these waiting periods is how they interact with each other and with the social security payment periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a real life example. A constituent of mine got four weeks work and those four weeks crossed over into three social security payment fortnights. Because of that, his payments were automatically cut off. On reapplying at the end of his month's work, he was required to serve the ordinary one-week waiting period plus the four-week liquid assets test waiting period. All up, for four weeks work he lost 10 weeks benefit. As senators can imagine, he will not be keen to take on short-term work next time it is offered to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one final aspect of the liquid assets waiting period. A person with $4,900 worth of liquid assets has to serve just the one-week ordinary waiting period while a person with $5,100 of liquid assets has to wait five weeks before receiving any payment. So an extra $200 in liquid assets means an extra month before a person receives any income support payments. That is another anomaly which should be looked at. I acknowledge the steps the government has taken to reduce the impediments to people taking up short-term work opportunities, but I feel that these other issues also need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final initiative in the bill which I want to mention is the making of advance payments of unemployment benefits. Jobsearch and newstart recipients who satisfy certain requirements will be able to receive an advance payment of up to 14 per cent of their yearly allowance. These advance payments will be repaid by fortnightly deductions of 14 per cent from their allowances. It is important to note that the payments will be available only to help a person `participate in activities related to finding paid employment' or `to comply with a jobsearch or case management activity agreement'. They will not be available to cover any sort of personal expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney has raised concerns: firstly, that a repayment of 14 per cent is too high; secondly, that if the government were genuine these payments should be made over and above the normal allowance; and, finally, that there exists a potential for clients to be pressured to take a loan in order to satisfy the Commonwealth Employment Service that they are complying with their activity agreements, for example, to buy new clothes for interviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment by the Democrats is that overall this is a positive scheme, but it is one that does have some potential for drawbacks. It was my original intention to move an amendment to reduce the 14 per cent repayment level to 10 per cent. As some senators will know, a limit of 10 per cent repayments was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1990. The committee's report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to withhold 14 percent of a social security client's basic entitlement is, in most cases, unjustified, given the subsistence level of pensions, benefits and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I intended to move to lower the repayment level in the bill but, while I had some initially sympathetic noises from the minister's office, I have since received clear indications from both the government and the opposition that they would not support such an amendment. So I simply put on the record the Democrats' concern over the 14 per cent repayment level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put on record our support for the notion that if the government were genuine on this issue&mdash;that is, genuine in assisting the unemployed to return to work&mdash;it would provide these payments over and above the unemployment allowance. If a case manager determines that some particular activity or purchase is absolutely necessary for an unemployed person to be fully prepared for a return to work, then I believe the government should be prepared to contribute to, if not completely cover, the cost of that activity or purchase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill will give effect to a range of measures announced in the 1994 budget and white paper on employment and growth. Calling it a white paper on employment is, of course, something of a misnomer as the measures contained in the bill will ultimately do nothing to solve the unemployment crisis, which is a disgrace to this government. We will not be opposing the various measures contained in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will enable the long-term unemployed to participate in group or cooperative enterprises, CES approved courses of study and training, a wider range of voluntary work and the development of self-employment opportunities whilst continuing to receive income support. It will enable recipients of jobsearch, newstart and the sickness allowances to obtain part of their benefits in advance, by way of lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After three months of receiving jobsearch or newstart, a person can claim up to $500 of his or her benefit in advance to assist in jobsearch activities. For the long-term unemployed, as much as $1,000 can be advanced in this way for activities approved by the person's case manager as assisting that person's return to work. The advance will be recouped by way of deduction from the person's future payments of the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do wonder about the potential for abuse of this system, the manner in which it is likely to be administered and the costs of having to recoup advances from people who find work and cease to receive benefits from which deductions could otherwise be made. In such cases, legal action will be necessary to recover the amount in the ordinary way that debts due to the Commonwealth are recovered. One may well question the cost effectiveness of this exercise. We will be interested to see how it works in reality. The coalition is sounding a note of caution about some of the problems that we perceive may well happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also codify elements of the activity tests and agreements to which jobsearch and newstart recipients are subject. Currently such recipients are variously required to take reasonable steps to comply with an agreement or undertake certain activity and to actively seek and be willing to undertake paid work that in the secretary's opinion is suitable for the particular person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill there will be a presumption that any paid work is suitable unless the secretary is of the opinion that it is unsuitable, having regard to factors such the person's skills, experiences and qualifications, pre-existing illness or injury that might be aggravated by the conditions of work and whether wages are at award levels. Similarly, a client would be deemed not to have taken reasonable steps to comply with the activity test or agreement if the main reason for the failure involved a matter within the client's control or if the circumstances preventing compliance were reasonably foreseeable by the client. These changes may well prove to be a boon for administrative lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also modifies the liquid assets test, which defers payment of certain benefits for a specified period if a client's liquid assets exceeds certain thresholds. The test will now be applied to both members of a partnership and only once in any 12-month period. In addition, one-off lump sum payments of non-housing related debts such as clearance of a house loan or proceeds from the sale of a home where settlement occurred in the last 12 months and the proceeds are to be used to purchase a new home will not be counted for the purposes of calculating a person's liquid assets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will allow the test to operate in a more equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residency requirements will be relaxed to enable refugees to claim social security benefits on the strength of their refugee status. This is a sensible measure as it is wholly unreasonable in the special circumstances of refugees to predicate the payment of benefits on the meeting of a five- to 10-year residency requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will enable the payment of additional family payment in circumstance where both parents are temporarily absent overseas for a period of 13 weeks, provided the child in respect of whom the payment is received remains in Australia. Consequently, some recognition is given to the plight of aid workers, overseas students, people overseas on government business or in a policing/peacekeeping role, and academics on study leave. It is recognition which the coalition recently pressed for in the context of the home child-care allowance but which, hypocritically, the government rejected out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of fringe benefits, as it applies to the family payment income test and the parental income test for jobsearch and sickness allowance recipients under 18, will be broadened to include payments made by an employer to an employee to assist the employee in meeting the costs associated with a housing loan or rental payments. This will merely close a loophole overlooked by the government in implementing similar legislation to other classes of fringe benefit as recently as six months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also features a measure designed to prevent the unintended tightening of the income test treatment of pensions and annuities taken out on or after 1 July 1994, as a result of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which took effect from that date. This will ensure that social security clients with superannuation investment products purchased with eligible termination payments will be treated equally regardless of the date those products were purchased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blinding feature common to all these measures is that, despite their inclusions in a so-called white paper on employment and growth, they provide no evidence anywhere in the bill of policies which will generate more jobs than might otherwise be available. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether it was a Freudian slip when the parliamentary secretary spoke of an unemployment rather than employment system, but the only labour market reality of the 1990s that the government has been either unable or unwilling to grapple with is the reality of long-term, entrenched unemployment. Clever rhetoric about labour market realities does not mask the fact that the white paper is fundamentally misguided. </PARA>

The Democrats welcome the introduction of this allowance. We acknowledge that, in terms of family income, for many unemployed families it will not mean any increase in their overall payment. It will, however, significantly alter the way in which that payment is provided to the family. In particular, the parenting allowance will be paid directly to the person who is actually providing the care for the dependent child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This represents a very positive change by making payments directly to the carer and as such provides much greater recognition of the value of the caring role. It certainly is about time that the social security system recognised the valuable contribution to our society of caring for children and ceased to view some parents as simply another person's dependent spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, and this point is very important, the parenting allowance will make payments available to some very low income couples. This is important both from a social justice point of view and also from the point of view of ensuring that couples always remain better off by having at least one member of the couple in some form of employment. While it is true that for some couples the parenting allowance will simply mean a change in their payments title, it cannot be denied that it does provide a substantial increase in support to a significant number of low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the additional cost to government of the allowance will be around $350 million a year and some 117,000 families are expected to be nearly $60 a week better off. The Democrats see the introduction of the parenting allowance as a very progressive step and one which has our full support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next I want to discuss the changes in the bill to the income test applying to jobsearch and newstart allowances. Clearly, the current income tests need to be reworked to remove the existing poverty traps and to provide arrangements under which there is a greater incentive for a person to take up substantial part-time work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing test, any income above $85 a week that a single unemployed person earns reduces the level of that person's unemployment allowance dollar for dollar. In other words, that person gains nothing from increasing his or her earnings from $85 right up to about $210 a week. Given this, it is no wonder that only 10 per cent of single unemployed people and 20 per cent of married unemployed people are currently reporting any income from casual or part-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reforming the income test, we need to ensure that people will always be better off by increasing their income. To do that, we need to abolish the 100 per cent withdrawal rate. What this bill proposes is that for single unemployed people there should be a $30 a week free area, then the next $40 a week in earnings will reduce benefits by 50 cents in the dollar and then 70 cents in the dollar after that. For couples, an income test similar to that which applies to Austudy would be implemented under which individual members of the couple would be income tested separately until the spouse's income exceeded $235 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government's aim in this exercise is to smooth out the income testing in such a way that there is always an incentive to earn extra cash, while at the same time maintaining the incentive for people to take on any full-time work opportunities. In that process of smoothing out the income test and in particular making it more generous at the upper levels, it is inevitable that some people will be worse off than they were previously. What the Democrats are keen to ensure, however, is that these people are not going to be substantially worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with this, I indicate that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to reduce the lower taper rate of 50 per cent to 40 per cent. I intend to incorporate a number of tables at the committee stage which will clearly show that, if my amendment is accepted, the income test reform will be much fairer than the government is proposing. The Democrats certainly welcome the reform of the income test, but we do not believe the government should be removing the poverty traps by severely disadvantaging those with the least amount of access to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final measure I want to discuss is the new widow allowance. This allowance is going to be available to women aged 50 years or more who have been widowed, separated or divorced after turning 50 and who have no recent work force experience. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), in her second reading speech in the House of Representatives, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many of these women grew up in an era when it was not expected they would ever work outside the home after marriage and have no recent work force experience with which to confront the harsh realities of the job market.</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly agree with that sentiment, and indeed the Democrats have been pursuing the plight of older widows for some time now. I have had come to see me widows who have been out of the work force for over 20 years and, realistically, stood little chance of obtaining work. I want to pay tribute to the numbers of them who have pursued this issue for themselves. They have not just bleated about it and allowed politicians to do the work for them. There are numbers of widows in Queensland and, I understand, in every other state who have taken up the cudgels on their own behalf, and they deserve credit for pursuing this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these women, however, have been forced onto the unemployment queues and have been required to hit the streets job hunting only a short time after the death of their long-term partners. That is a pretty awful prospect. They have had not only to cope with the enormous loss of their partners but at the same time to jump through the hoops and hurdles put in front of them by the Department of Social Security. Consequently I was very pleased to see the government step back, take another look at the position of older widows and, in recognition of their difficult circumstances, announce the introduction of the widow allowance. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), after I made a speech in the Senate giving a couple of examples, did get in touch with me and certainly offered to pursue those particular instances. No doubt this measure that he has brought in is in recognition of his looking at those particular circumstances and illustrations, which were given not only by me but by many other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of these women was made even worse by the decision of the government, supported by the coalition, to increase the pension age of women to 65. The Democrats would prefer to see this payment made at the pension level and to have the associated concessions that go with the pension. Our priority, however, was that these women not have to go through what, for many of them, was a futile and demoralising exercise in job hunting. There are a number of areas where we believe the widow allowance can be improved, and I will be pursuing those in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude my contribution to this debate I want to make a few comments about the overall changes contained within this bill. Some six months ago I gave a speech to the Senate in which I highlighted the incredible complexity that exists in our social security system. At the end of that speech I asked the government to take the comments I had made, and the comments of many in the welfare sector, into account in its future approach to this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see before us today is a prime example of the piecemeal approach to social security that I cautioned against in my speech. For example, we have a parenting allowance subsuming the home child-care allowance. The home child-care allowance was introduced only in September this year, just three months ago, and was itself a replacement for the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add to the confusion, many unemployed couples received a letter saying that they might be eligible for HCCA and inviting them to apply for it. So they filled out the application forms and shortly afterwards received their first payment of HCCA. Within the next fortnight, however, they received a further letter informing them that their social security payments would be split and one member of the couple would be receiving a new partner allowance. Because of this, they were told, they would no longer qualify for HCCA by virtue of the income test. The government raised these people's expectations&mdash;and let us not forget that these are people who are relying on very low social security payments&mdash;and then within a fortnight totally dashed their hopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received, as I am sure many others did, numerous letters from unemployed couples who were confused and disillusioned by this treatment by the Department of Social Security. I understand that it may never have been the government's intention to extend HCCA to unemployed couples, but the way in which the department went about this was unfortunate, to say the least. This is just one example of the constant state of major changes to the structure and titles of benefits to which people are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the government is undertaking a comprehensive reform of the social security system. Most of those reforms are welcomed by the Democrats. But I think the point has to be made that the way in which those reforms are being implemented seems to be disregarding the stress and confusion that those reforms might inflict on people. Surely the transition to some of these new payments could have been implemented in a much smoother fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 introduces two new social security payments&mdash;the parenting allowance and the widow allowance. The parenting allowance is an income and assets tested payment which will be available from 1 July 1995 to partnered persons with dependent children under the age of 16 years. This payment will subsume the home child-care allowance, which itself came into effect only two short months ago but is yet to be finalised in this parliament. The confusion generated by the introduction of the home child-care allowance and the intended abolition of the dependent spouse rebate pales into insignificance when compared with this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parenting allowance will be structured to include a maximum basic component rate&mdash;which is, in effect, the HCCA component of $61 per fortnight at the top end&mdash;which will be neither affected by a partner's income nor taxed. Where the partner's income exceeds $763.43 per fortnight, the parenting allowance will be limited to the HCCA component rate. That basic rate can be further reduced only by the recipient's own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the coalition that argued long and hard that the HCCA discriminated against unemployed couples whilst assisting high income couples where there is only one breadwinner. The introduction of this allowance finally vindicates that argument, but the merging of these two payments is, quite frankly, a recipe for mass confusion at every social security office. In adopting this tack-on approach to family assistance measures, how can this government realistically expect people to know where they stand?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose the introduction of this allowance, because it patches up some of the holes that government keeps leaving in the family assistance policies. But, had the government got the HCCA right in the first place, we would not be here wasting yet more time talking about yet another new allowance. I do not always agree with the Democrats but I have to agree with Senator Woodley that it is now a total mess. How people are supposed to understand what their entitlements are is beyond by belief or understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other new payment introduced by this bill is the widow allowance. It is a decidedly poor substitute for the widow B pension, which the government is intent on abolishing. Widow allowance will be available from 1 January 1995 to women 50 or over who lost their partners after the age of 50 and lack relevant work force experience. It will be income and assets tested, and set at the same rate as jobsearch and newstart allowances, but will not be subject to any activity tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley, when he was speaking, went on as though only the Democrats had made any noises about this pension and the problems associated with it especially for women who are widowed over 50. I have to add here that the coalition has also argued strongly that it was very difficult for women who were widowed after the age of 50&mdash;many of whom had not been in the work force for a very long time, and many of whom had not worked since they got married&mdash;to be expected to undertake job activity testing and to find employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women already on a pension or benefit will be able to transfer to the widow allowance without having to meet the `no recent work force experience' requirement, provided they meet all other criteria and apply to transfer before 1 January 1995. In any event, no new claims will be accepted from 1 July 2005 except for women born before 1 July 1955. Widow allowance recipients will have access to the JET program and unemployment and education entry payments, but not the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government decided in 1987 to phase out the widow B pension, the coalition has been vigilant in exposing the blatant discrimination Labor's policies have perpetrated against older single women. Here we are in 1994 with the white paper perpetuating this discrimination and the government introducing a new payment that is no more than a poor imitation of the one that is being phased out. There is a stricter income test, the allowance rate is less than that for a pension, and health care cards are not quite as generous as pensioner concession cards. This so-called new payment should therefore be seen for what it is: an about-face on a policy move the coalition has condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing widowed person allowance will simply be renamed `bereavement allowance' with no other changes. To further exacerbate the confusion this bill will generate, the government is bringing in changes to partner allowance, itself introduced only a matter of months ago. Partner allowance will be restricted to persons over 40 with little or no recent work force experience and without dependent children under 16. Those with children under 16 will have to rely on the parenting allowance, whilst those over 40 without children will have to quality for income support in their own right. Those who no longer qualify for partner allowance after these measures take effect on 1 July 1995 and are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed will have access to newstart labour market programs and the job compact. Partner allowance will also be payable to partners of those receiving age pension, disability wage supplement, disability support pension, mature age allowance and rehabilitation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the coin is that the wife pension and the mature age partner allowance, as well as the special needs wife pension, are all to be phased out. Those who qualify by 30 June 1995 will have their entitlements preserved, but after that there are to be no new grants. After 1 July 1995 persons who would otherwise have qualified for these benefits will have to apply for parenting allowance, partner allowance, disability support pension or carer pension, depending on their circumstances. The savings from this exercise arise because allowances are paid at rates below those applicable to the pensions being phased out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The education entry payment of $200, payable once in any 12-month period, will be made available to recipients of wife pension, partner allowance, parenting allowance and widow allowance. The extension may well encourage greater participation in education programs by certain social security recipients, but $200 will obviously only go so far in covering the costs involved in a return to education. Moreover, by diverting people into study the government will at least succeed in achieving a cosmetic reduction in unemployment by reducing the number of people actively seeking work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test applicable to allowees is also modified by this bill. Currently the income test is joint, in that couples are treated as a single economic unit where the rate of payments depends on the combined income of both members. This will no longer be the case. Instead, a person's income will affect his or her partner's social security entitlements only if the income is sufficient to preclude the person from entitlements altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one-to-one relationship which currently exists between income earned over the income threshold and the amount of income support lost as a result is also abolished. Quite clearly, if each dollar of income earned results in a dollar of income support being forgone, there is very little incentive to earn that income in the first place. The bill introduces a new taper system which reduces the maximum rate from 100 to 70 per cent. So after a standard $60 per fortnight free area, a 50 per cent taper applies for income up to $140 per fortnight and a 70 per cent taper thereafter. To the extent that unemployed people can find the part-time or casual work the government hopes to encourage, then to some extent this modification may assist the unemployed. It does, however, presuppose the existence of those jobs without which unemployed people will not be able to take up these benefits. There are also several groups of unemployed people, who total in number around 57,000, who not only will not benefit from these measures but will be disadvantaged by them. Quite clearly, what the government gives with one hand it takes with the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other substantive amendment contained in this bill is to repeal the sunset clause which would otherwise lead to a discontinuation of the advance pharmaceutical allowance from 1 January 1995. Repealing that clause will mean the allowance will continue indefinitely. The remainder of this bill contains amendments to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act. I believe it is fair to say that these amendments are merely consequential to the changes wrought in the social security area, and we will not be opposing them. The coalition is not opposing the various measures contained in this bill, which will cost $249.7 million in 1995-96, $263 million in 1996-97 and $282.2 million in 1997-98.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Following Mr Willis's statement yesterday foreshadowing tax rises, this morning the Australian Democrats, which might be described as the fourth faction of the Labor Party, gave the green light to a carbon tax, higher taxes on superannuation contributions, taxes on consumption, an increase in company tax and a tax on speculative investment, a lot of which will impact severely upon low and middle income earners. As part of a government which at the last election promised that it would not increase taxes, will the minister now unequivocally rule out any or all of these new taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not to be assumed that any particular revenue policy will be adopted in the next budget or at any time between now and then. The government has not ruled out any particular fiscal option at this stage because of the need to adopt a responsible approach to the economy. The economy is obviously growing faster than what we could sustain at that level, although there is absolutely no reason to believe that growth cannot be sustained at a much higher level than has been the case in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Willis said yesterday, there are a number of reasons why the economy can be expected to slow in the normal course of events without specific further measures of a fiscal kind. There is the expected slowdown of private consumption growth and the expected slowdown in private dwelling investment growth, in respect of both of which there are signs already clearly evident. The tax increases which have been legislated are yet to come into effect. They include the excise on cigarettes and tobacco, and the one per cent increase in the general sales tax from 1 July, which we legislated for but which is yet to come into effect. There is also the impact of the interest rates increases that have already occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Willis has made clear that all of those factors will need to be taken into account when the government assesses its macro-economic policy settings as part of the deliberations that will occur in the run-up to next year's budget. That remains the case. As Mr Willis said yesterday, we do not rule out any option at this stage because we are a responsible government. But it is clear that the revenue option is one that cannot be ignored. In that context, it is not inappropriate that some suggestion should be put into the public domain by other parties that will no doubt have an interest in the outcomes in this respect.</PARA>

Two days ago, the minister said that we had misinterpreted the statements of both Mr Willis and Mr Keating and that there was no intention to increase taxes. He is now saying that tax rises should never be ruled out. My specific question was whether the Australian people can now see, as has  been suggested by the Australian Democrats, a carbon tax, which will add to the cost of production, higher taxes on superannuation contributions, taxes on consumption, an increase in company tax or a tax on speculative investment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said only a couple of days ago that it was inappropriate and quite wrong to read into anything said by the Prime Minister, Mr Willis or anyone else that any decision and commitment had been made and that any acceptance of tax increases was evident. We have not made any such decision. It may well be the case that no decision of that kind will need to be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Zakharov for this question because it is important to acknowledge the excellent record Australia has in the management of AIDS. One of the consequences of that is the way the high reporting rate can be distorted or seen as a negative. There are a number of things to say about that rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, it is important to recognise that the number of AIDS cases per 100,000 population in Australia reflects the age of the epidemic in Australia. The AIDS epidemic began in Australia earlier than in many other western Pacific countries, so more HIV positive people have progressed to AIDS here than in other countries. The other important element is that AIDS is legally notifiable in all states and territories in this country, and all notifications are reported to the National Centre for HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of cases in each state also determines the Commonwealth AIDS funding to the states, which is acting as an incentive for full reporting and is clearly contributing to our very significant number. In fact, the rate of ascertainment, or the high rate of reporting, is testimony to our comprehensive surveillance system, particularly compared with many other countries where notification of AIDS has been low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in Australia we can take some pride in the success we have achieved in containing the epidemic. We have moved from a peak infection rate of approximately 3,000 in 1983 to about 600 new infections annually now. This is a good result but it is still 600 new infections too many. We aim to reduce that figure to 300 new cases per year by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we also have some success that we can directly sheet home to the national strategy, which has been in existence since 1989, and that is where the Commonwealth government is working with the state governments and very significant non-government organisations&mdash;including gay organisations, drug workers, sex workers and so on&mdash;to make sure that all those people involved in the area are actually fully informed of, contributing to and participating in that strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's contribution has been over $30 million to the states and territories on a cost share basis and another $20 million for national education programs and priorities, particularly research and evaluation. A further $51 million has been allocated to states and territories for hospital based treatment and care of people with HIV/AIDS under the Medicare agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has recognised all along that good government deals with problems by recognising reality, not by denying it. I believe that our education and prevention strategies, focusing on providing clear, factual information to individuals about risky behaviour, and encouraging people to take personal responsibility for sexual and drug use behaviour, has contributed very much to seeing that reduced figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community education has been very important but we also cannot disregard the vital importance of anti-discrimination measures, and privacy and social justice safeguards, to the success of this strategy. Australia has embarked on a comprehensive program of legislative review, including specific legislation to make it unlawful to discriminate against people with HIV/AIDS, or people believed to have HIV/AIDS, in the provision of services, accommodation, sport and access to premises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also very committed to international efforts to fight the AIDS epidemic. This is clear from our increasing development assistance for HIV/AIDS to countries within our region and from our continuing involvement in an effective global response to the pandemic. It is very important to recognise that Australia is regarded by many people as a real leader in the management of AIDS. Indeed, other countries often seek support, information and advice from Australia to see if they cannot have the same kind of effect. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The various tax and outlay suggestions that have been made by the opposition were costed recently by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as amounting to somewhere between $10.5 billion and $12.5 billion. In addition, we had the absolutely extraordinary statement from Mr Costello yesterday that the opposition, if it had the chance, would in one year remove the entire anticipated budget deficit for next year of $11.7 billion. He was asked yesterday morning what the opposition thought should be the cut in the budget deficit. His answer was, `Well, it's got to be greater than the $11.7 billion this year and it's got to be greater than the deficit next year.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tax cuts that are not to come into effect before 1998 are not the subject matter of Mr Willis's or the government's preoccupations at the moment. Our preoccupations, our concerns, are with the management of the economy right now and with the demand that we can expect to arise and to be the situation over the next few months and over the next year or two. That is the management problem at the moment. It is a luxurious management problem because it occurs in the context of a growth rate of 6.4 per cent which has already produced over 400,000 jobs since April last year. A survey that has just been announced this morning&mdash;the Kelly national hiring intentions survey of 2,000 companies&mdash;estimates that 100,000 new jobs will be created in the March quarter 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>

On top of the 100,000 jobs that have already been created, we are talking about, before the end of the March quarter 1995, another 100,000 jobs in the pipeline. Our expectation, of course, and our promise were that the 500,000 jobs would not be occurring until something like 1996. This is the rate at which the economy is growing. These are the benefits that have been generated by the government's policy in an effectively inflation-free environment over the last few months and which we can expect to continue in the future. Of course, we have a concern about the economy overheating. Of course, that implies responsible fiscal and monetary management.

The truth of the matter is that the opposition has committed itself, by one statement or another in relation to tax exemptions of interest, health care rebates, tax and family payment system changes and capital gains tax changes, to somewhere between $7 billion and $9 billion worth of tax breaks&mdash;not increases in outlays, tax reductions&mdash;to the Australian community, plus God knows how many outlay increases in the area of aid and public expenditure on hospitals, infrastructure, tertiary education, Aboriginal housing and police.

The President of the United Graziers Association said that the agreement was the culmination of thousands of hours of work by community, industry and government representatives. He correctly described the $15 million south-west strategy as a blueprint for a regional community approach to structural problems faced throughout Australia. The strategy targets the long-term economic environmental and social viability of the region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been polite about this publicly to this point in time, but I am not going to be from now on. Over three months ago a similar offer was made to the Fahey government of New South Wales&mdash;the government that is continually complaining about the Commonwealth's drought response. We have yet to receive a response to a similar $15 million package for the droughted farmers of the western division of New South Wales. This leaves many droughted farmers in New South Wales in a ludicrous position. Their neighbours across the Queensland border can now start rebuilding their future in a sustainable way while the New South Wales farmers, who have the same problems on the New South Wales side of the border, are waiting for the Fahey government to stop twiddling its thumbs and respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pressed the New South Wales government on a number of occasions over the last three months to give us a response. We still have not got a response, which is why I have not raised this publicly before. The Fahey government is paying a lot of pre-election lip-service to the drought, but its position is not unexpected. The actions of the Fahey government speak a lot louder than its words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would be aware, the Prime Minister announced in the September drought package that interest rate subsidies under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme would be demand driven&mdash;a major policy shift. This means that, if a farmer is eligible for a 100 per cent interest rate subsidy&mdash;and we have identified many farmers who are&mdash;then the Commonwealth will provide sufficient funding to ensure that they receive the full 100 per cent; in other words, they have got an interest-free loan. That is not, I regret to say, happening in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the scheme, state governments are required to match dollar for dollar any interest subsidy over 50 per cent. The Queensland government did match our offer and its primary producers are now reaping the full benefits. The New South Wales government, however, only chose to match the subsidy up to 80 per cent to save its own money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refers to the conflict in Bosnia which is now well into its third year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As will be evident to anyone following the news, the situation in Bosnia has deteriorated very markedly in recent weeks from the situation which prevailed for most of 1994 where there had been grounds for guarded optimism. Overall the intensity of fighting had eased and the international humanitarian relief operation had been working effectively and the lull had improved prospects for a negotiated settlement, with the contact group, comprising the US, UK, France, Germany and Russia, presenting a constitutional plan for Bosnia based on a roughly equal division of territory. Regrettably, the Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly refused to accept the proposal, notwithstanding additional pressure imposed upon them including, in particular, the embargo by Serbian President Milosevic. All that is behind us and, unfortunately, things have been spinning potentially right out of control, producing disastrous consequences for the civilian population and for UNPROFOR personnel. The most recent diplomatic setback occurred yesterday in Sarajevo when Bosnian Serb leaders declined to meet UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events around Bihac, including the NATO air strikes, launched in response to the missile attacks on the safe area, which did not deter Bosnian Serb military actions, have obviously placed the UN and the international community in an extremely difficult position. The problem for the UN, and indeed for NATO, is essentially twofold. On the one hand there is the need to avoid taking sides in the conflict and to adhere strictly to UN resolutions specifying the conditions under which a response to violations of a safe area may be considered.

I have just been advised by ABARE that this estimate has now been revised down to an estimated reduction in total crop production of 54 per cent to 13 million tonnes. Wheat production is expected to fall by more than 50 per cent to the lowest level since 1972.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure that honourable senators would agree that these figures provide a stark illustration of the economic impact of this drought, which, I regret to say, shows no sign of breaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Meteorology assessment remains that drought conditions will persist in Queensland and New South Wales until the end of this year and will be followed by poor and late summer rain, consistent with the El Nino phenomenon. It is assumed by ABARE in its forecasts that the remaining states will receive below average spring rainfall. It should be noted, however, that, if these weather forecasts are incorrect and there is an immediate return of average rainfall, this would do little or nothing to improve the situation for winter crops and the financial returns of affected farmers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Devereux for his question. The Small Business Forum is not open to the media but, because of the very wide number of representatives there from various small business organisations&mdash;namely, over 30&mdash;it is not surprising that discussions that take place do get coverage in the wider community. Yes, there was a very vigorous discussion at the Small Business Forum when, at my invitation, a representative of the Trade Practices Commission, Mr Asher, addressed the Small Business Forum about the operation of the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several small business organisations have expressed disappointment in recent years since the act was amended to allow for unconscionable conduct to be taken that no case has been taken under that provision in the business community. Many small business organisations believe there have been plenty of cases available. Mr Asher, who represented the TPC at the Small Business Forum, said that, in his view, the Trade Practices Commission had not yet received enough evidence that would warrant a case being launched that, in its view, would be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was hotly disputed by some representatives of the Small Business Forum, and in particular by Mr Delaney from the Motor Traders Association of Australia. He believed that there were cases available that should be taken and that the Trade Practices Commission would, therefore, successfully establish some case law as an example of the business activity in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out that when I was a member of the Senate legal committee a few years ago, I, along with other members of the Senate committee, was lobbied by the Trade Practices Commission Chairman, Mr Fels, to actually put these provisions into the act to strengthen it. I think most members of the committee agreed with that position. It was subsequently accepted by the government and the legislation was amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I do have an interest not only as the minister responsible for small business but also as a former member of that committee in seeing these provisions take effect. When these cases are successfully prosecuted&mdash;if we can get a case&mdash;it will immeasurably enhance the opportunities for small business to protect itself against the stronger economic influences of big business in commercial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a result of those discussions, I got agreement with Trade Practices Commissioner Asher that there would be a subcommittee of the Small Business Forum, chaired by Mr Delaney, to have ongoing consultations with the Trade Practices Commission, to see whether evidence could be collected that could lead to a successful case being launched by the Trade Practices Commission on behalf of an allegedly injured small business partner. I believe this is another example of the successful working of the Small Business Forum on behalf of the interests of the small business community in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Vanstone requested an explanation as to why she had not received an answer to question Nos 1739, 1740, 1741, 1742 and 1743 which were placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> on 5 October 1994. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought a response from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to Senator Vanstone's request for an explanation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the questions to which Senator Vanstone refers are, in the words of the Attorney-General's Department, phenomenally long, running to 6 1/2 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and, of course, incorporating enormous technical detail. Although there are only five questions, they contain a total of 52 component parts, many of which have several parts. It is a bit disingenuous to make out that answering such questions is an easy task. The Attorney-General's Department is working through these questions in consultation with the ASC and the Australian Stock Exchange. The Attorney-General expects to be in a position to table his response shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note Senator Vanstone's criticism of the department's consultation with the Australian Stock Exchange. However, given that a number of the questions specifically ask for information about the arrangements of the ASX, consultation is entirely appropriate and, indeed, essential. I think Senator Vanstone should recognise that. For instance, to give an example of the sort of question that the Attorney refers to, paragraph (7) of question 1740 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation the Australian Stock Exchange and each such self-regulatory organisation: (a) what procedures will it have in place to ensure that persons advising investors in such products have the necessary expertise to do so; (b) will such a body have in place a system for the registration and examination of persons advising or soliciting orders on behalf of licensed stockbrokers equivalent to that maintained by the Sydney Futures Exchange  . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So it is difficult to imagine how one could answer a question such as that without the advice of the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>

His dishonest answer about New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority support for drought affected farmers does not take into account the following aspects of interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was lauding the Queensland government for providing an interest subsidy package on existing debt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Premier's office has stated that, `Collins is dishonest because he's slating New South Wales by not comparing apples with apples.' In New South Wales the Fahey government has extended interest subsidies to existing debt and&mdash;and wait for it, minister&mdash;new borrowings. That is a point that the minister very conveniently omitted. This allows struggling New South Wales producers to keep their farm business units going. They can borrow for seed, fodder, fertiliser and machinery to keep the farm going. They can be well placed when the drought breaks to help return the farm to profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales is allowing access to credit to keep the farmers in the game through this drought. This compares with the government's exceptional circumstances package, which happens to miss most of the state. The minister should admit that his government's policies have failed. We now have 5,000 farmers relying on Farmhand because his drought assistance package misses 96 per cent of farmers in the areas affected by drought. It misses all of northern New South Wales, the Hunter Valley and many other areas that do not happen to meet his very mean minded, restrictive categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast the minister's inadequate, mean minded package with what the New South Wales government has provided. It has an interest subsidy scheme for small business. Let me hear the minister interject about small business. He does nothing for small business.

It does not have the minister's resources, but it has put in $22 million in August and $65 million more recently. It has appointed a drought relief coordinator. In addition, it is giving local government rate relief; matching funds on the rural adjustment scheme; assisting with electricity accounts; providing more money for stock and animal welfare; establishing cloud seeding projects; providing free fodder and water trains to all drought declared regions; free cartage of charitable goods; and increasing grazing on land. </PARA>

Drought is something that should be entered into between the state governments and the federal government in such a way that people can get through some of the problems they have.

<PARA>Senator Parer asked a good and sensible question and the answer was grossly misleading again. Senator Parer had made the point that the government's policy on Sydney airport to date has resulted in the closure of the east-west runway, a reduction in the number of aircraft movements from 65 to 55 an hour and a vast and entirely unexpected increase in the noise levels experienced by the residents of the suburbs north of the airport.

It was forecast for the year 2010, and the FAC pointed that out in a letter which I referred to in the Senate estimates committee hearing, and which he blissfully ignored. There have been huge demonstrations of civil unrest. Senator Parer said, `The peak travel period is approaching. What are your immediate plans for resolving this policy fiasco?' In particular, what is the minister doing about resolving the noise fiasco? That is an essential point. The response Senator Collins gave, very selectively, was `They are gradually increasing the take-off rates'&mdash;in other words, increasing the noise fiasco at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the following question at Senate estimates. Maybe Senator Collins was asleep at the time; he was when I asked one question, and gave the wrong answer. This is a serious proposition. Why did the minister for airport noise, Mr Brereton, tell the Wednesday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that one way to deal with the problem was to make sure planes took off from the furthest points on the runway and reached high altitudes as quickly as possible? At the Senate estimates committee hearing the acting chief executive officer said that this was not being done, that the normal procedure of aircraft taking off was from their nearest taxiway intersection, that that was continuing and that there was no intention to change the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is being done&mdash;absolutely nothing. Why would Mr Brereton then say, `This is the way to help solve the problem,' if the CAA itself says that it has got no intention of changing it, and that is what they have been doing all the time. Are we having another of those public relations exercises, like the incredibly dishonest one about pretending that the deviations from the flight paths are all the problem of the pilots? That is a disgraceful stunt, which Senator Collins repeated today when he said that there is no point in pilots swearing on bibles. The radar tracks show what is happening. They surely do, and they do not show what Senator Collins pretended they show today when he presented a map saying, `Look how we are fixing up the problem.' That is a map showing take-offs and landings when there is a southerly wind blowing. The problems at Sydney airport relate to when there is a northerly wind, which is prevalent in these particular months of summer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that when that kind of wind is blowing&mdash;and Senator Collins said, `But there was some storm turbulence that day'&mdash;that is the sort of map we get. The map that Senator Collins held up, and which the CAA presented to the Senate estimates committee, is grossly and disgracefully misleading. It does not show the problem of northerly take-offs, which is the problem facing the people to the north of the airport. This is an attempt to mislead the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>What we have learned today is that this federal government has approved the dumping of 10,000 drums of radioactive waste on the very site where Japanese space authorities are looking to trial their space shuttle program in early 1996. Within the past two weeks, dozens of trucks have begun rolling up at the disused airfield's test shop at Evett's Field, 45 kilometres north of Woomera, to off-load these drums of radioactive waste material from the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who approved this transfer? None other than the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook. Is it any wonder the Japanese are now feeling nervous and very apprehensive about their 1996 trials at Woomera? Is it any wonder that Minister Schacht's response to my question today was so restrained because he has been undermined by his senior minister, Senator Cook?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response to this question is that the site has not been finalised. But that response is misleading, because he knows full well that Evett's Field is the preferred option because of the sensitivity of the American military operations involving the Woomera township airfield. He knows full well that the Defence Department has rejected the use of the Woomera airfield for the Japanese space trial because of these concerns. Therefore, the only real choice is Evett's Field. He knows full well that the Japanese are considering the upgrading of the Evett's Field to conduct their space shuttle tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look very closely at the minister's reply. Firstly, he says that this radioactive waste is at an extremely low level and will not affect the proposed space operations. If these 10,000 drums are of no threat to the environment and represent no danger, why then did the government move them away from Lucas Heights in the first place? Secondly, the minister failed to answer how long the radioactive waste will be stored at the site. That is a pathetic attempt by the minister to avoid this sensitive issue, because he has been caught out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese space authorities are on the verge of finalising a $1.6 billion space program, conducting tests in Australia, and the minister responsible for the Australian Space Office cannot say how long the government will allow these 10,000 drums of radioactive waste to remain at Evett's Field. How many times have we heard this minister espouse the need for an innovative space industry development here in Australia but fail to develop one?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian space community does take up the challenge by promoting it, when a major initiative is taken&mdash;and the Space Office is on the verge of clinching a deal involving the Japanese space agency&mdash;we find that his senior colleague, Minister Cook, allows the transfer of thousands of radioactive waste containers to the very site where these crucial space trials are to take place.

<PARA>The Government's intention is that, subject to s 22 of the SRC Act, the Tribunal should be able to deal with complaints relating to decisions of trustees taken before or after the commencement of the Act. However, to protect trustees against the risk of having to pay a benefit twice (that is, payment to a beneficiary and subsequent payment to another person who successfully brings an action to the Tribunal in respect of that payment), trustees can follow the procedures set out in ss 14 and 15 of the SRC Act (the `protection procedure').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, the `protection procedure' provides that the trustee can notify a person in writing that it proposes to pay a benefit, at which point the person must lodge an objection with the trustee within the prescribed period (28 days): paragraph 15(2)(a) of the SRC Act. The trustee must then deal with the objection within 90 days: s 101 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The trustee can then notify the person of its decision in relation to the objection, including the prescribed period within which a person may complain to the Tribunal about the decision (28 days), and if the person then wants to lodge a complaint with the Tribunal, he or she must do so within that 28 day period: ss 14(3) of the SRC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above `protection procedure' has a limited application prior to commencement of the SRC Act. Specifically, as the Tribunal commenced operation on 1 July 1994, the 28 day notice period under ss 14(3) could not have commenced to run until 3 June 1994.  Therefore, where the trustees have followed the `protection procedure' prior to 1 July 1994, a complaint from a person who establishes an interest under paragraph 15(2)(a) will only be subject to the 28 day notice period under ss 14(3) where such notice was issued by the trustees on or after 3 June 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Departure Tax Amendment Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill set out the legislative framework for the government's budget decision to replace the departure tax with a $27 charge on international passenger movement. The government also announced in the budget that the charge would be collected by the airlines and port authorities. The Departure Tax Amendment Bill proposes to rename the act the Passenger Movement Charge Act and substitutes `charge' for the word `tax' each time that it appears. Section 8 of the bill proposes to increase the impost from $25 to $27, and section 9 states that the increase applies to departures from Australia on or after 1 January 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill again renames its principal act and substitutes `charge' for `tax'. The bill also proposes to institute a number of transitional measures. The bill does not touch on the proposed alteration to the collection system. Section 10 of the Departure Tax Collection Act authorises the minister to make special arrangements for the collection of the tax. Section 11 authorises the government to make regulations concerning the supply of tax stamps to approved agents and the sale of stamps by those agents. Accordingly, it is not necessary to amend the Departure Tax Collection Act to enact the new system; it can be implemented by a special arrangement and by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departure tax was introduced in the 1978-79 budget and was initially set at $10 per adult passenger. It was increased to $20 in 1981. The independent inquiry into aviation cost recovery recommended in 1984 that the tax should become part of the aviation cost recovery system. As a result, the Hawke government, in 1986, transferred responsibility for collecting the tax to the international airlines. The government withdrew the tax from the cost recovery arrangements in 1988 when it established the Civil Aviation Authority and reduced the tax to $10. The airlines were then relieved of the responsibility of collecting tax. So there has been a plethora of changes over a decade to the method and form of collecting the departure tax, or the passenger movement charge as it is now called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government raised the tax back to $20 in 1991 and increased it again to $25 in the 1993-94 budget. The government argued in both years that the increase in the tax was needed to fund an increase in overseas tourist promotion, but of course none of those funds were directed to overseas tourist promotion. It was sort of hypothecation without hypothecation, and we are having it again in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has long supported the introduction of a new collection system for departure tax. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents has described the departure tax as a nuisance at best and as a nightmare at worst. It is a nuisance to the foreign visitors who may be low on currency as they leave and are then forced to exchange more currency, often at an unfavourable airport exchange rate, or to cash a travellers cheque. It is often a nightmare for the increasing numbers of visitors to Australia from non-English speaking countries&mdash;their numbers have increased around 30 per cent during the last two years. The administration of the departure tax system costs about four per cent of the revenue collected, approximately $4 million to $5 million in 1993-94, a figure that is high by world standards. The cost of collecting the charge would be about two per cent of the revenue collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that a third advantage of the new system is that the charge would be linked to the cost of customs, immigration, quarantine processing and issuing short-term visas. As I said before, a hypothecation without hypothecation. While it is related to those costs, it goes into consolidated revenue and is not the revenue received by those particular departments to pay for their operations. Of the $27 charge, $19 is notionally attributable to the cost of providing customs, immigration and quarantine services, and the remaining $8 is intended to cover the cost of short-term visitor visa processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passenger movement charge, despite its name, is legally indistinguishable from the existing departure tax. It would not constitute a fee for service because Australian citizens departing Australia would be required to pay the full charge even though part of it is identified as being for visitor visa processing&mdash;a process they do not have to go through. The government itself has recognised that the charge would still be a tax by its having attempted to enact it through separate impost and collection bills. By doing so, it has ensured that it can avoid a High Court challenge along the lines of Air Caledonie v. the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will recall that the government amended the Migration Act in 1987 to impose a $5 immigration clearance fee on all passengers, including Australian citizens, entering Australia. Like the passenger movement charge, it was to be collected by the travel industry. The High Court ruled that the fee was unconstitutional; that it was a tax, not a fee for service. At least this time the government has recognised that its proposal is a tax and not a fee for service, but the same equity considerations that we raised in 1987 are still valid now. It is by no means clear why Australians travelling overseas should be singled out to pay a proportion of the cost of processing visitor visas for those coming in from overseas. Visa processing and checking benefits all Australians, not just those who travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real test of the government's commitment to cost recovery will occur as the efficiency of Customs' passenger processing operations increases. The Australian Customs Service and the department of immigration are currently involved in examining a number of measures that could reduce the passenger processing time at the airport barriers from 55 seconds to 10 seconds. Passenger data would be exchanged through the electronic data interchange techniques while the passengers were still en route. This would allow Customs and Immigration to process the passenger names through their computers before flights arrived. The process could result in a reduction in the average processing times at the barriers from 55 seconds to about 10. This could result in considerable staff reductions in the Australian Customs Service. If the government is serious about using the charge as a cost recovery measure rather than as an excuse to raise taxes, the charge should come down, or at least remain constant, as these reforms start to take place. I indicate to the government that, with the passage of time, we will be watching this with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reforms of this sort are essential if our airports are to handle the forecast increase in international visitor arrivals through to the end of this decade. The continued economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region is laying the groundwork for a sustained increase in international visitors. According to the Australian Tourist Commission, visitor arrivals could double from their current level to about 6.8 million by the year 2000. I think even today those figures have been revised upwards. Arrivals from Asia and Japan could increase by over 130 per cent, which of course will be of great benefit to this country in respect of not only the current account deficit but also employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the tourism and aviation industries are intertwined. That is the reason we would, in government, have a portfolio based on tourism, aviation and customs with a single minister rather than leaving aviation as the overlooked responsibility of an overworked minister with two other full-time portfolios which have no relationship whatsoever to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, I travelled to Japan and Taiwan where I met with a number of airlines, tourism wholesalers and travel agents. I extolled the virtues of Australia as a holiday destination but was particularly interested in what they, the customers&mdash;the people who intend to come here or intend to direct people to come here&mdash;had to say. What they said to me was interesting. They said that our marketing efforts overseas seemed to concentrate on a relatively narrow market&mdash;what are termed in Japan as the young office ladies and honeymooners. They urged us to promote our country as a destination for other demographic groups, such as the early retirees&mdash;the silvers&mdash;and students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also mentioned to me that they were concerned about safety. They looked on Australia as being relatively safe&mdash;though not as safe as their own countries&mdash;compared with other countries. Things that turned them off were matters such as the increase of graffiti that is appearing on our buildings, both public and private, and public drunkenness. I raised these points in a speech I made to the Australian Tourist Industry Association's annual conference in Adelaide. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee), in a frivolous way in the other place, tended to ridicule those comments. He was obviously unaware&mdash;because he did not bother turning up at that conference&mdash;that they represented some of the real concerns of our customers. In this sort of business, which is so competitive internationally, we must take heed of what our customers say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fault is typical of not only the minister but the government as a whole. They are out of touch with real people. This is indicated by the fact that, with the recent fiasco we have had at Sydney airport, at the meeting on Tuesday night not one member of the federal parliament from the Labor Party, from either the House of Representatives or the Senate, was present. It is understandable from the Senate point of view, but the question was asked, `Where is the minister?'&mdash;a fair question. He should have been there listening to the concerns of people. The problem, if it is not corrected, will have an absolutely adverse effect on our potential for tourism development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Tourism is invited to give a speech, his office rings up the peak body concerned and asks it what he should say. They all tell me this. That is exactly what he does. He regurgitates the words and walks away feeling warm and fuzzy while the people who were forced to listen make cynical asides. What he does not do, and what the coalition does do, is go out and talk to the hands-on operators. That is of course what we have been doing. One of the interesting features about the Minister for Tourism is that when he is needed he is silent. As I said, he turns up to annual conferences, wherever there is a crowd gathered, says warm and fuzzy things and walks off. But when he is needed he is invisible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic example of this was when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) put a stop to the Oyster Point resort at Port Hinchinbrook, when everyone knows that one of the great problems facing this country in regard to tourism is, in fact, the lack of accommodation. If we do not have accommodation and resorts, we are not going to gain the benefits that come from international tourists, and Senator Schacht will not collect the money he thinks he will collect through the airports if the potential for tourism is not realised because of a serious matter such as the lack of accommodation at areas such as Cairns, Far North Queensland, the Gold Coast and Sydney. It is clear that the government did not talk to the hands-on operators when it decided that the changeover date to the new passenger movement charge collection system should be 1 January next year&mdash;a date that was apparently dreamed up without any understanding of the realities of implementing such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Service only supplied the airlines with the specifications for the new tax a short time ago. The government and the airlines are still negotiating about reimbursing the start-up and running costs of the necessary computer systems. It is unlikely that either the airlines or the operators of computerised reservation systems such as Fantasia and Galileo would be able to put the necessary changes in place before 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A related difficulty is the question of pre-sold, charge unpaid, tickets. Many international passengers buy their tickets well in advance of the date on which they travel&mdash;in the main, I suppose, to pick up discounts offered. I have been advised by Customs that as at 30 September, the airlines had sold about 500,000 tickets for travel on or after 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, I understand, is aware of this complication and has advised me that the existing departure tax booths would be retained for a transitional period to deal with those pre-sold, charge unpaid tickets. For many months, then, some passengers departing Australia would have paid the passenger movement charge when they purchased their tickets. But many other passengers would be told at the airline departure counters that they would have to join a queue to pay the charge. Some passengers departing Australia would have pre-purchased $25 departure tax stamps. It is conceivable that they could be told at the airline departure counters that they would have to join the queue and pay an extra $2. This parallel arrangement would be both costly and a considerable nuisance to many passengers&mdash;a perverse outcome, given the government's stated intention of making it more convenient for them; an intent, as I said earlier, with which we agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the system in the middle of the peak travel period would only increase the delays and inconvenience. It was argued in the House of Representatives that the best way to resolve these difficulties would be to defer the introduction of the new system until October 1995. The international airlines will be introducing their 1995 northern winter schedules on 29 October 1995 and it would be convenient to bring in the new collection system at that time. It was the sort of approach taken by the British government because of a similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had discussions with the opposition on this matter to attempt to come to a negotiated agreement on the date. We have agreed that the introduction of the new system from 1 July 1995 would be an acceptable compromise. I might say there is not a lot of logic to it; it does not fit in with the October pattern of the airlines but it is a decided improvement on 1 January 1995. I will therefore be moving an amendment at the committee stage to defer the introduction of the new system until 1 July 1995. It should be stressed that the amendment would not prevent the government from increasing the charge to $27 on 1 January 1995. It would only prevent it from attempting to jump to the new collection system prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition supports the introduction of the new collection system. It is, however, clearly necessary to defer the introduction of the system for a short time to avoid the chaos that would be caused if it were introduced on 1 January 1995. </PARA>

The government did have extensive discussions with the airline industry over several months. I was involved in some of those discussions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that a large number of countries have a similar system to the one we are introducing here&mdash;a departure charge being paid when people buy the ticket, as part of the ticket price. So we are not world leaders in this regard; we are following what others have already introduced&mdash;something which has been working quite adequately in other countries. I assure the Senate that, as a result of this legislation and the amendment that has been negotiated between the government and the opposition, the government will not require international air operators to collect the new charge before 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the new charge of $27, which is an increase of $2 on the present charge, is acceptable in terms of the cost to the government of providing the range of services for people departing Australia, the tourist industry, and tourists coming to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that over the coming years the industry, particularly the airlines and the tourist industry, will look very closely at the efficiency of the system and the efficiency of the service they get from government departments. They will look at ways of ensuring that the departure charge is relevant to the service they receive. I think this is a reasonably fair assessment on their part. We will respond accordingly. If we did not, I am sure there would be some pretty vigorous debate from them if they thought the charge was getting out of hand compared with the service they were receiving. If they are able to identify efficiencies to improve the system, to reduce the cost, I am sure they will bring those forward to us and we will be happy to hear from them about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, it is with pleasure that I lead the opposition contribution on the bills before us today&mdash;the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994&mdash;because, as you would know, it is a role that I took on numerous occasions in the past when I held the veterans' affairs portfolio. I do not propose to say a great deal today on these bills. I recognise that the Senate is keen to get as much legislation through as possible at this time of the year. The coalition support for these bills has already been made clear by my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal firstly with the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. Despite not having been the shadow minister for some time, I note that some things never change. The honourable member for O'Connor was given no time at all to consult with veterans' representatives on the budget measures bill before it was debated in the House. One has to ask why. It was only after the bill had been debated in one house of the parliament that the honourable member for O'Connor was able to consult with veterans. That is most unsatisfactory, and not just for the opposition. After all, we represent the concerns of the people who have fought to defend our country and our interests, and we are worried about the lack of courtesy and consideration given to those men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is particularly unsatisfactory when we recognise that a number of measures are not due to take effect until January next year, and yet the bill was rushed through the House of Representatives. Because of the lack of time for consultation, the honourable member for O'Connor indicated in his speech on the second reading in the Main Committee that the coalition reserved the right to make amendments to the bill at a later date in the Senate. The coalition will be exercising that right today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of initiatives which will be welcomed by veterans. For instance, it introduces automatic payment of funeral benefits to the estate of a veteran who was receiving an extreme disablement adjustment pension or who was a former prisoner of war. Proposals for an education entry payment, removing the waiting period for refugees eligible for service pension, and non-payment of pharmaceutical allowances for those who have been away from Australia for 12 months or more are measures which are not being opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor has indicated that the removal of the requirement for a proportion of the members of the Veterans Review Board to be registered or licensed medical practitioners is sensible. With the Repatriation Medical Authority's statement of principle now binding on the VRB, there is clearly no longer a need for a strict level of medical representation at the level of the VRB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important provision in the budget measures bill is to compensate applicants to the VRB for the costs of obtaining medical evidence after the primary decision. This is to be provided up to a maximum of $425. I believe such a provision is to be welcomed. It is long overdue. I remember receiving representations on this issue when I held the veterans' affairs portfolio. I know that this provision will be welcomed by the ex-service community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the honourable member for O'Connor pointed out in his speech on the second reading, the government seems to have overlooked the cost to veterans of obtaining medical evidence for the Specialist Medical Review Council. The honourable member for O'Connor has already circulated an amendment which will ensure that arrangements for the Specialist Medical Review Council regarding compensation for medical expenses are brought into line with those proposed in this bill for the VRB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) was initially very cool on this amendment. The reasons offered were not convincing. Although appeals to the specialist review council are allowed strictly on medical grounds, it remains the case that a veteran would be required to pay for the appropriate medical advice. Given that the minister has conceded that there will be few instances in which appeals to the specialist review council will take place, the financial impact of the amendment would be negligible. It is therefore difficult to see what was standing in the way of the government supporting this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister indicated that he would go away and consider the amendment more thoroughly. I am pleased to say that the minister's office has now indicated that the amendment will not be opposed by the government. The arguments of the honourable member for O'Connor were obviously persuasive, and I look forward to the government's consent here in the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 implements a number of 1993 budget announcements by the government. Perhaps the most significant is the increase in the service pension age for women. This bill will increase the qualifying age for women to receive the service pension from 55 to 60 years. The honourable member for O'Connor spoke at some length in the Main Committee debate on the hypocrisy of the government with respect to this provision. We all remember the government, before the last election, viciously attacking the coalition's proposal to increase the pension age for women, as set out in Fightback. Post-election, we are seeing yet another broken promise, yet another stealing of ideas from Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still believe that this was a sensible measure which recognised the need for equality of treatment between men and women. Despite caucus committees set up to reverse the budget decision, the government went ahead with its proposal. Any residual caucus embarrassment at the sheer hypocrisy of introducing the policy was simply ignored by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pathetic measure is the increase in the maximum rate of dependent child add-on payable to service pensioners for children who have not turned 16. The increase amounts to $1 a week per child from January 1995. This</PARA>
<PARA>is the result of the government's failure to meet its promise not to increase taxes after winning office in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the infamous Dawkins budget we saw significant de facto tax increases, adding greatly to the cost of living, especially for those on lower incomes. This increase is a token gesture addressing that cost of living impact. Service pensioners with children will see the government's increase of $1 a week, the maximum rate additional family payment, for the pea and thimble trick that it really is. Other measures implemented by this bill, such as the reintroduction of advance pharmaceutical allowance for the chronically ill, are supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition will not be opposing either of the bills before us. We will be moving an amendment to the budget measures bill and, as I said, we look forward to the consent of the government in doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by looking at the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. The Australian Democrats will not be opposing this bill. We see the initiative to align the treatment of compensation payments received by service pensioners and income support supplement recipients with social security payments as fair and sensible. It prevents double dipping and only applies to compensation payments received on or after 1 January 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure applies only where a person receives a compensation payment which includes a component for loss of earnings or loss of the capacity to earn, and then only if the service pensioner or income support supplement recipient is under pensionable age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see the automatic payment of funeral benefits to the estate of a veteran who, at the time of death, was receiving extreme disablement adjustment or was a former prisoner of war. But in this context I would say that this is the only point in this proposed legislation that has been queried with me. Our consultative process has found that the bill has the unanimous support of the veteran community, except for the following point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked why this payment goes to the estate and not to the widow. I agree that, under normal circumstances, the widow would be the chief if not the sole beneficiary. But this is not always the case, particularly where there has been a second marriage and children of the first family are involved. In cases where the widow has paid the full funeral expenses, and can produce documentation, should not the funeral benefits go to her instead of to the estate? I would be grateful for advice from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on this matter when we reach the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of reimbursement of the cost of obtaining medical evidence by applicants to the Veterans Review Board, I note that when the opposition asked in the other place for this to be extended to applicants to the Specialist Medical Review Council, the minister ruled it out on the grounds that individuals would generally not be making representations to this body. However, he did say that the matter might be discussed further. I am pleased to see that it will not be only the Democrats who are supporting the amendments that Senator Newman will be moving today but that the government will also be supporting the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats welcome two other measures in the bill: the education entry payment, which will assist veterans under pension age to further their education and enhance their employment chances; and the removal of the waiting period for service pension for refugees. These people did not have a choice when leaving their home countries and are extremely unlikely to be able to obtain a pension from their country of origin. The non-payment of pharmaceutical allowance to service, disability and war widow or widower pensioners when overseas for a period of 12 months or more seems fair and reasonable and we will not be opposing this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 we see another example of this government's policy of putting an unpopular measure in with a whole lot of good news. The unpopular measure I refer to is the increase in the qualifying age for service pension for women. I am mindful of the amount of legislation we still have to get through in this place, therefore, the Democrats will not be moving any amendments and running the same arguments we did on the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to place on the record that we are opposed to this measure. We do not believe, even though a very small number of women will be affected&mdash;I understand the minister has identified only a handful of people, some 52 in all&mdash;that this is fair and reasonable. These women simply have not had the opportunities that their male counterparts have had to access regular employment and superannuation and to build up a resource, whether it be through superannuation or capital gain, to see them through their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have referred the question of adequacy of women's retirement incomes, especially the implications of raising the retirement age, to the superannuation committee for report on 28 February 1995. We will be watching the outcomes and the findings of that inquiry with interest. The other two measures in this bill&mdash;the advanced pharmaceutical allowance and the pensioner child-care add-on&mdash;are beneficial to veterans, and the Democrats will not be opposing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 contains initiatives that are not related to this year's budget. The first of the initiatives will bring service pensions into line with the social security age pension by gradually increasing the qualifying age at which women can apply for the age pension from 55 to 60 years. This increase will be phased in over 20 years. It will affect very few women because the vast majority of female veterans have already reached 55 years of age. The second initiative restores the facility to pay pharmaceutical allowance in advance after 1 January 1995. The third initiative increases child related payments to service pensioners by $1 per week for each child under 16. This will apply from 1 January 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill, the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, contains the remainder of this year's veterans' affairs budget package. Together with the first bill passed in the winter sittings it certainly delivers major benefits to the ex-service community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that this all or nothing package was agreed to by the national bodies of the major ex-service organisations. These groups realistically recognise that it was not possible to improve benefits to veterans and their dependants unless the increased expenditure could be offset by savings elsewhere. We agreed that we needed to ensure that the benefits are provided to those with a genuine entitlement. Clearly, the entire package will provide immediate and long lasting benefits to veterans and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we may all be certain about the initiatives in this particular bill I will very quickly run through them. Compensation payments received by service pensioners and income support supplement recipients are to be treated on a similar basis to compensation payments received by social security income support recipients. There will be an automatic grant of funeral benefit to the estate of a veteran who dies and who is a former prisoner of war or who at the time of death had been receiving extreme disablement adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two measures relate to the Veterans Review Board. The requirement that a proportion of the board be medical practitioners will be removed and applicants to the board will be entitled to reimbursement for certain costs of obtaining additional medical evidence to support their application. This latter measure is expected to increase the proportion of claims finalised at this level of the determining system. An education entry payment will be payable to partner and carer service pensioners and to income support supplement recipients who undertake study. Refugees will be exempted from the waiting period for service pension. Pharmaceutical allowance will no longer be payable to persons who are absent from Australia for 12 months or more. Service pensioners whose rate has been reduced to nil will no longer have to reapply for the pension if their income and asset circumstances change sufficiently within six months to allow pension payments to recommence. The bill also contains amendments that are consequential to several of the major initiatives in the first budget measures bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees asked specifically about the reimbursement of funeral expenses to widows when a funeral benefit has automatically been paid to the veteran's estate. In such a case, the widow may claim the costs from the estate. In conclusion, I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. The two budget measures bills together represent a very significant step forward for veterans, enhancing what I believe is internationally regarded as perhaps the finest repatriation system in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take considerable pleasure from my own involvement in the formulation of the package during my term as Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The citrus industry has spoken at length to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee about the problems associated with the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill, which I will address in my amendments. First of all, I want to talk about the amendment that I flag I will be moving to each of the bills in this package. The amendment addresses my concern about the level of parliamentary responsibility that is usurped as a result of Australia signing the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk about some method by which we can incorporate within this set of bills at least some modicum of parliamentary responsibility for those people who are representing Australia and who are currently usurping the interests of elected parliamentarians and the people of Australia by not referring back to us and discussing their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment would effectively ensure that there is some responsibility and accountability in relation to negotiations in the World Trade Organisation on behalf of Australia. We are simply trying to say that, when such a powerful organisation is established and Australia becomes part of it, it is no longer good enough for an ambassador to disregard the democratic process and take direction only from the minister. The World Trade Organisation will be able to set regulations with which we must bring our laws into conformity, or face action. It is therefore imperative that our ambassador does not have the power to negotiate in contradiction of our laws. To do so would be to take direction from the minister to argue a regulation that would change our laws. This is a total violation of due process and a means of circumventing parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason that this should be permitted when, in consequence, the parliament is put in a position where it must change law or defy the World Trade Organisation. It is thoroughly undemocratic and anti-democratic. If government wishes to change our laws, then it should do so through parliament. It should not try sneaky backdoor methods to put parliament in a position where changes cannot be considered on their merits but only in the context of trade penalties if changes are not made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have considered the fact that there may be cases where legislation change or a general direction for change may be desired, yet it is not appropriate to put that into practice until there is a multilateral agreement for such a change in place. I can see how that can occur and why the parliament might wish change yet not wish to make a pre-emptive or unilateral change. The case of disarmament is such a circumstance, where the ability to safely disarm may be partially determined by others' willingness to do so. We understand the principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our amendment we have attempted to assure that the parliament can recognise this. We make provision for the parliament to approve an approach in negotiations that is inconsistent with existing Australian law. We have said that a resolution of each house can provide such guidance. We recognise the principle that change can be worked towards. What we do not recognise is the ability of such change to be pursued in the World Trade Organisation without account gained from the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This obviously becomes a means of circumventing parliament. If a direction of change is appropriate, it should attract parliamentary support without the threat of trade sanctions or exclusion from the World Trade Organisation. That is why we will be moving this amendment. That is why we will move this amendment to each bill. It is a simple amendment requiring some accountability to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the Australian Democrats are prepared to support our amendment. We hope that the opposition, or at least the National Party, will support this amendment since it really does nothing more than what it has been calling for. The amendment says that negotiators cannot argue against Australian laws in a forum that can put substantial pressure on parliament to change those laws without prior approval. It says that the negotiators cannot agree on our behalf to such changes as go against our laws without parliament's general approval for the direction of such change. We think this is entirely appropriate and a minimum requirement of accountability and ministerial responsibility to the parliament and people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to many people over the last few weeks who believe that everything will be okay. I was speaking to a journalist just a few minutes ago. People believe that those circumstances that have existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will continue, that if they have not been challenged under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, they will not be challenged. They believe all of the reassurances from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that it should be okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to believe that the Foreign Investment Review Board will not, for instance, be able to continue to regulate the trade that we have in Australia and the conditions upon which we accept investment. The Foreign Investment Review Board is not involved with the basis upon which we accept imports. That is mainly controlled through the ministry and by certain regulations. We find now that we have fewer of those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not enough to put our faith in the Foreign Investment Review Board. At last count&mdash;and it may be less than this now&mdash;there were 18 people working in the Foreign Investment Review Board in Australia. When I last looked at its activities outlined in its annual report I found that it mainly chased around&mdash;and fairly ineffectually&mdash;trying to keep an eye on what kind of real estate speculation occurred in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that the toothless Foreign Investment Review Board will be able to fight for the level of Australian ownership. Someone said to me a few minutes ago that if what I say is true what was the point in having those huge arguments about the level of ownership in the media. That is a very good point. What was the point in having those huge arguments about the level of ownership in the Australian media if in time, through these kinds of bills which have regard to the World Trade Organisation, for instance, our print media can, and I assume will, be subject to up to 100 per cent foreign ownership? That is just one example. People believe it will not happen. Why will it not happen? Not because it cannot happen under the World Trade Organisation, but because we have a Foreign Investment Review Board and it has not happened up to now under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to believe that world corporations worked on those principles. If the general push under the World Trade Organisation legislation means there will be less control and fewer restrictions on the level of ownership in major corporations and major industries and corporations have a greater ability to gain monopoly control of particular industries in Australia, then it will happen. It may not necessarily happen tomorrow, but it may happen in times to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not just talking about multinationals. I am talking about the push to make sure that we export rather than produce for our local economy. Industries have to get bigger to survive. Smaller industries&mdash;family industries, family farmers and those in the citrus industry&mdash;will go under if this happens. If honourable senators do not believe me, then they should talk to the banana growers who have already gone through this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chiquita banana is now fairly common in Australia. United Fruit has a fairly large stronghold in an industry that was largely controlled by Australian interests. I know that we have been talking about the citrus industry. We are talking about what in time will happen to our entire horticultural industry. In this debate we have talked about a number of other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is still primary industry we are talking about. Primary industry was supposed to be the big benefactor under this proposal. What we are talking about in this amendment is the ability of this parliament to know and be able to scrutinise the arguments being put on behalf of Australian industries and citizens in country regions of this country in relation to the environment and the future environment of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are saying that we have to have bigger citrus producers, they have to have lower costs to survive and they need more irrigation, which has been talked about today, what is going to happen? We need to think about that. If the prices stay the same for five years we will have to produce more for the same price. What is that going to do to our water systems, our environment and what amount of fertiliser will we require? We are talking about one industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have people negotiating on behalf of Australia who do not have to report back to parliament and who can even push for much more than what our current legislation allows. That means they can, on our behalf, agree to change our laws or agree to push for something that will, in effect, change our laws not just now but in the future. What we are saying is that there should be some accountability on the part of those people who negotiate on behalf of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not just about taxes, it is not just about specific industries, it is about changes that could have an impact right across Australian society. I have heard of incidents where local governments have been told that they have to change their by-laws or their by-laws cannot be used because they would be considered to be GATT-inconsistent. Therefore, we have to think now whether we want a fall back so this parliament can be consulted about the line that is being taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Labor Party of the decisions that were taken at its national conference which related to labour conditions. Does the Labor Party know or can it find out&mdash;can anybody find out&mdash;whether or not those people who are negotiating on behalf of Australia will be negotiating, for instance, in line with the decision that was made at the Labor conference? Has that been taken into consideration? Has that been discussed? What line is being taken on that question? What kind of accountability can we expect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler may have something to say on this issue. I would be keen to know from the minister how we can be sure what line is being taken&mdash;whether the concerns of the Australian industry are being taken into consideration or whether a strong line of free trade is being taken by the negotiators on the basis that those who do not benefit from GATT suffer collateral damage. That is the kind of accountability that I am interested in. That is the minimal request that we are making in amendment No. 1 to the Sales Tax (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are disposed to support this amendment. I have been extremely concerned with the way our international trade negotiations have been carried out without regard to the social and environmental consequences. We have the example of NAFTA where a side agreement was concluded on environmental matters. Yet when I suggested to the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) that we should push for these matters at both GATT and APEC, the answer was, `No, we cannot do that. We are concentrating on trade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the minister can tell me that he will push for side agreements in the APEC negotiations or that he has or will push for a subcommittee to be established at APEC to deal with social and environmental issues which will arise as a result of the liberalisation of trade, then I will be very happy. My distinct impression was that our government was not prepared to raise or push these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, we are now putting ourselves in a position where we are becoming part of the worldwide race to the bottom, where capital will be chasing the lowest costs. And the lowest costs do not stop simply at legally low wages. They go as far as child labour, which I have had occasion to put on record in this parliament. The Senate passed unanimously a motion for the government to take any action. Even if the government decided that it was prepared to take some decisive action, in line with Senator Harkin's bill in the United States, to prohibit imports of goods produced by child labour I wonder whether under the World Trade Organisation agreement, under the GATT agreement, we would be able to have such a law without it being challenged by countries that do not want to be hampered in this way. The minister might wish to address that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the amendment that Senator Margetts is moving, I certainly applaud the spirit of it and support it in substance. I have some difficulty at line 4 in agreeing to `may not take any action and enter into any negotiation'. It is difficult for parliament to put the condition on initial negotiations, initial actions that may lead later to any number of agreements or conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make this a practical amendment, it may be useful to take out four words in line 4, `take any action or' and take out the word `negotiation'. Then it would read that we do require the agreement of parliament before any agreement or arrangement is concluded by people who are negotiating on behalf of Australia in these trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may then be an amendment that the government will seriously consider&mdash;certainly one that the opposition should seriously consider. After all, the opposition has told us that it is concerned about the government concluding treaties without the approval of parliament, that this is an infringement of the sovereignty of the Australian parliament. Here is an opportunity for the opposition to show that it means what it says. I would like Senator Margetts to consider the amendment I have suggested. She may wish to amend her motion.</PARA>

I might use this as the one occasion in this debate in which I will address some of the general issues that are raised. We could deal with them on every amendment, but I do not intend to. This amendment is being moved to every bill. I hope we are not going to debate it every time. I will try to range across some of the general issues, the misconceptions and the fundamental flaw in the amendment and then, even if I agreed with what it was trying to do, the problem I would have with putting it as an amendment to this body of legislation in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall start from the end; let me deal with that issue first. If we move this amendment&mdash;even if the government agreed with it, which we do no not&mdash;it means that this act does not come into effect until the parliament comes back next year and carries another piece of legislation. So first and foremost it means that Australia cannot be a founding member of the World Trade Organisation. That is what this amendment means first and foremost, because by 1 January we will not have passed another piece of legislation in accordance with subclause (2). It means that maybe one day we will be a member. We might have to renegotiate our entry; that is not absolutely clear. Certainly all the benefits are put at risk. That is No. 1. It is a fairly fundamental problem. I think that ought to knock the amendment out by itself but let me use the opportunity to debate the two broader issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it repugnant that people come in here and assume that they are the only people concerned about the consequences of actions that are being taken. I accept that people are entitled to disagree with what we are doing. It is a democracy. People are entitled to get up and say, `You are wrong and the consequences of what you are doing are adverse.' I accept that people are entitled to do that and that they think that sometimes. Maybe sometimes they are right, maybe sometimes they are wrong. But I find it absolutely offensive that they think they are the only people who care about the consequences, that the people who go overseas to represent Australia do not take any cognisance of the social and environmental consequences of their action or that the government, which gives them the negotiating brief, does not take into account the social and environmental consequences. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those opposite might think we are wrong. They might think we made a miscalculation. They might think we are so dumb we cannot see what they can see with great clarity&mdash;that this is going to cause all sorts of disastrous consequences. Of course they are entitled to that view and to express it as forcefully and forthrightly as they wish, but to pretend that they are the only ones who are concerned about it and that we are blithely pursuing a course of action without considering its consequences, or perhaps even consciously pursuing something which has adverse consequences, is something that I find continually offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one other generality I want to deal with, the great myth of the race to the bottom. If the race to the bottom was correct, the great mass of the world's investment would be taking place in Sudan. Sudan has the lowest wages in the world and no environmental laws. Everybody would be going there. Nobody would be investing in Singapore because wages are very high there and they are starting to develop strict environmental laws. But the truth is that everybody is investing in Singapore and no-one is investing in Sudan because life is more complicated than the opposition's conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to take it closer to home, why is there no investment in Burma, which has very high tariff walls and high protection and does not let any of this alien Western consumer influence in, but everybody is investing in neighbouring countries as they open up? It is not the case that we find some inevitable correlation between where corporate activity takes place and where the wages are lower. I am not saying that is not a factor in decision making. If it were not the case, the poorest people in the countries who are growing would be much worse off. That is why countries can grow out of poverty if they get the right policies. People do go and invest there and provide jobs to the people there. All the underdeveloped countries that have emerged from that to have very high living standards have essentially done it based on that strategy. The truth is that you do not find the lowest wages in the countries with the lowest protection. You find that the lowest wages are in the countries with the highest protection and that investment does not follow. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with the substance of this amendment. Once the passion of the Greens' and the Democrats' concern about GATT passes, they will think about the consequences of this amendment for other pieces of legislation and for the international negotiations into which Australia enters. The Greens and the Democrats generally welcome and support the application of the international negotiations into which Australia enters. Sometimes they think we are a bit soft about them, but our three parties tend to have a more common view than does the coalition. If we were ever to accept this proposal&mdash;we are not going to&mdash;I do not think the people the Greens and the Democrats support in the overwhelming majority of issues would welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it seems to me that the amendment is flawed for other reasons. That is a matter of political comment and a matter for their judgment. It does not really matter whether it is right or wrong. What worries me about it is that it is entirely unrealistic in its sense of how international negotiations take place and it flies in the face of the relationship between the executive and the legislature under the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the law of Australia should not be able to be changed without a decision of this parliament. That is what we are doing now. The so-called attack on our sovereignty is actually an expression of our sovereignty. We are making a sovereign decision to join this organisation. If it undermines the sovereignty of nations, it is very hard to understand why more and more countries are battling to get into it. People are not striving to get out; they are battling to get in. There are 140 member countries and 22 applicants&mdash;all the big, new emerging economies. China, which has never been renowned for not having concern for its sovereignty, is desperate to get into this organisation&mdash;understandably&mdash;and is arguing very hard about why it should be in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, under the Westminster system, legislation is initiated by the executive, brought to the parliament and is approved or not approved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not always take it with good grace, but we always take it. There is no law that says that we have to like it&mdash;only that we have to accept it. As I was saying, that is the way legislation is initiated under the Westminster system. The negotiating brief for people who go overseas to represent Australia is approved by ministers and, where it is a major issue like this one, by the cabinet. That is an act of the executive government. We send people overseas when we know and have analysed and assessed the consequences for Australian legislation. It is no different from the Australian government making a proposal that any other law should be changed. We sit in the cabinet. We say, `This proposal means a change of law X.' We propose that change to the parliament. We bring it into the parliament, and the parliament decides whether or not it wants that law changed. We do that because, on the balance of evidence, we think that is what is in the national interest, and the parliament can decide whether we have got the balance right or wrong. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes that decision arises as a result of discussions with other countries, whether it is about a big treaty like this, bilateral negotiations with another country, or some other form of relationship to do with the International Civil Aviation Organisation&mdash;whatever it is. In that range of things, from time to time we come to agreement and we legislate. We would never have had an international civil aviation organisation if we had not had an initiative that overrode Australian legislation and came in with an executive proposal that we should have a law to regulate those things. The executive initiated it; the parliament approved it. It is the way in which our parliamentary system does, should and must work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not got time to debate at length the question of business and industry consultation on these matters, but I can tell senators that there were more than 300 meetings between the Australian government and business and industry groups and associations in the negotiation of this legislation. At the end of negotiations, the group responsible for coordinating industry consultation, the trade negotiation advisory group, said that the negotiation and the consultation in this process was a model for consultative process between government and industry.

What we are concerned about is the conditions under which we join GATT and the consequences of our joining GATT.

In a Chinese textile factory, the wage is now the equivalent of about $25 for a 48-hour week. There is no regard for work safety and there are no environmental safeguards. About seven years ago only one-third of all articles of clothing and shoes in our stores were imported; two-thirds were made in Australia. Why is it that that proportion has been reversed? Why is it that two-thirds of such items are being imported and one-third&mdash;and getting less; it will be much less after GATT and APEC&mdash;are made here?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was at least one question I asked which the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) has not answered. I will clear up another point that the minister made first before I re-ask the question. Senator Spindler said we were very conscious of the benefits to the agriculture industry. I need to put on the record now that there is a difference in degree between the Democrats and the Greens. We have both been very concerned about the implications of the GATT. People in this chamber may be very aware that the Greens did not wish Australia to sign the Uruguay Round of GATT because we had received information at the time about the problems with the agreement. We are very concerned that, if we signed the agreement and were so gung-ho about it, with all its problems that were so clear to a growing number of people last year, we would be facing these kinds of problems, being put under pressure to ratify the agreement and change our legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record that the degree of difference here is that the Greens did not wish Australia to sign the Uruguay Round of GATT because we saw it was such a flawed agreement and because we believed that many of the supposed benefits to the agriculture industry may well prove to be illusory. If they prove to be illusory, there will be other collateral damage, such as the way the government is tending to treat people&mdash;like the women currently in very poor conditions in the footwear, clothing and textile industries and other industries in Australia&mdash;and that those people will have been betrayed in the grossest sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $1 billion that is meant to come to the agriculture industry is supposed to come over a matter of years. We are already seeing the impact of climate change on our agriculture industry now. If we continue to have serious impacts from El Nino, reverse El Nino and drought as well as destructive weather patterns associated with El Nino and which are predicted under the climatic change by thousands of scientists, the markets to which we are hoping to gain access may well not be able to be filled by Australian producers. It is very clear that there is no loyalty amongst friends or former friends when it comes to filling those gaps in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, our current vulnerability to climate change may well have an impact on the benefits we are hoping for. Already the estimates from this year's drought are considered to be in the range of about $250 million. It does not take much mathematics to work out that, if we are hoping to make $1 billion benefit over seven years, and this year the impacts of climate change are something in the region of $250 million down, we could well be moving in the other direction at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might also be significant that many of the benefits that we are hoping for come from an assumption that the prices for commodities via GATT will increase. I believe that some of these assumptions are flawed. I believe they are flawed because they assume that there will not be a flooding of the market at any one time. They assume that people will be able to regulate the amount of agricultural produce from their particular countries. They assume that other countries will not be able to fill a niche at any particular time or flood the market at some other time. And they assume that the dumping provisions under the current international trade rules will actually work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has come out on a number of occasions during the hearings that we have had is that there are serious concerns about whether Australia will be able to take effective action on anti-dumping. Therefore, we may well be operating under false assumptions, because the ability for transfer pricing becomes greater under the Uruguay Round of GATT. So people can appear not to be dumping when in fact they are. They can go through a second country, leave the profits in a country where they get the least tax, then sell on and claim that they are not dumping because they have just upped their price by a certain percentage and then sold to some of Australia's traditional markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there are certain expectations and dollar signs in a number of people's eyes and the expectation that over something like seven years we will get $1 billion worth of benefits, it may well be that other provisions within the Uruguay Round of GATT, and enforceable under the World Trade Organisation, may work against the proposed benefits. That is not even counting the impact on employment. Employment is not really talked much about. There is an assumption about jobs, but if what we are doing is moving into the areas where we have a so-called natural advantage&mdash;in Western Australia, the Western Australian government talks about mining, forestry and those kinds of industries&mdash;we will continue to be a hole in the ground, a quarry for the world, and the prices of those commodities will go down and down over time, even with a so-called freer market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, if we become more and more dependent on commodity prices&mdash;the world commodity price is going down&mdash;what does that mean for our economy? What does that mean for the people who can be employed in that industry? Capital is freely moving around and does not have a tariff on it. So it is very easy to replace it in lots of industries&mdash;labour for capital&mdash;and it is happening more and more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going into a model where every country is being told to get rid of people and put in capital&mdash;structural readjustment. It is not suitable for each country, but that is the model that is being pushed into each country as a result of this new internationalisation of trade. First of all, I think we have to be very concerned that in our assumptions of the overall benefits we are not putting the value we should on people who will otherwise be considered as collateral damage. Those people will feel considerably betrayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I asked about the outcome of the ALP national conference is that I know a number of unions believe that as a result of the outcome of the national conference in relation to wages and conditions the government, which is negotiating on behalf of the unions, will be arguing for the ability for us to make decisions on behalf of, for instance, child labour in other countries, importing products of child labour. What I would like to ask the minister is: have our negotiators taken a strong stance as a result of the ALP national conference to incorporate the concerns of child labour into the World Trade Organisation agenda?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not say much more in this debate. I wanted to get that point on the record. A few of my colleagues may wish to comment on some of the specific amendments. Our general thrust is that we very much believe that this package of bills ought to go through as promptly and expeditiously as possibly. It is not as though something has been suddenly sprung on us.

It is not terribly complex to explain to the committee what the dispute resolution panel is&mdash;that is, what degree of sovereignty Australia is giving up. There is a difference. I know, as a lot of people who have looked into the GATT know, that Australia has been involved with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for many years. Most people who have looked into it also know that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has changed over the years from being an association which was largely concerned with getting a fair trade deal for the newly independent nations after independence to an agreement which is now working towards the World Trade Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very big difference between GATT and the World Trade Organisation is that the World Trade Organisation has power that the GATT did not.

Senator Margetts said that the effect of the legislation was to deprive Australia of sovereignty. My understanding of sovereignty&mdash;it is shared by most people who are involved in one form or another with international law&mdash;is that sovereignty means the right of a government to act in respect of its own country. I do not think Senator Margetts is suggesting that, as a consequence of an action which is brought before the World Trade Organisation, another country, a complainant, could make legislation in relation to Australia. It would merely be that the complainant would receive a declaration that Australia was in breach of certain provisions of the agreement. On the basis of that declaration the complainant country would then take legislative action to have effect within its own boundaries&mdash;to take action against Australia. Surely, that is what Senator Margetts is suggesting, is she not?</PARA></TALK.START>

What I meant was that under the World Trade Organisation&mdash;which does have considerably more power than the GATT, and that is why people are pushing for it to be signed&mdash;if another country finds a complaint, which is found in favour of the complainant under the dispute resolutions panel, against a law or a trade practice in Australia as being GATT inconsistent or World Trade Organisation inconsistent, they can require that Australia change that law or trade practice. If Australia does not change that law or trade practice, sanctions can be placed against Australia under this new regime. Those sanctions do not simply have to be tit for tat&mdash;a beef sanction for a beef sanction. It can be a wider sanction.

If we do not, the outcome can be sanctions or we can choose to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation.

There is not much use in our signing it if no one else takes any notice of it and there is nothing we can do about it. Australia will gain benefits from it.

For instance, if there were a choice between timber that was created in a plantation and like timber that had been obtained from a rainforest, and if a local council were to implement a by-law which said that it would not allow the purchase of timber that was obtained from a rainforest, how could that be, considering like products are not able to be distinguished under the Uruguay Round of GATT?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing that I am aware of that would lead to that conclusion, although I am checking to confirm that. There is a trade and environment committee of the World Trade Organisation&mdash;that is one of the things that distinguishes it from GATT, which did not deal with those matters&mdash;and it is properly looking at how we reconcile the legitimate international concern about environment issues with the legitimate international concern about trade issues. At this stage we do not think that anybody would succeed in an appeal to the WTO because of a shire council by-law of the type to which Senator Margetts refers&mdash;that is if anybody ever found out about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I think the proposal is a bit absurd, there is a legitimate core concern&mdash;which is, I think, what is motivating Senator Margetts&mdash;not to see the interpretation of international trade measures undermine the capacity of countries effectively to protect their environment or to implement international environmental agreements into which they have entered. We do not want to see that any more than we want to see an interpretation of environmental agreements in some way misused to cut across legitimate economic purposes. Misuse of one at the cost of the other is not something we would wish to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the WTO has established a committee on trade and the environment. There are legitimate concerns to be pursued there. I do not think the example is a good one. I reiterate that it has nothing to do with the bill before us&mdash;but it is a cause of continuing concern that will need to be addressed. Sooner or later, however, we will have to deal with the bill. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment removes sales tax from `not from concentrate' fruit juice&mdash;that is, fresh juice. The bill as it stands removes from Australian citrus growers&mdash;and they are the ones mainly affected&mdash;the concessional tax rate which has applied so far to juice which contains at least 25 per cent local content. The evidence that the committee has had from the industry shows quite clearly that hundreds, if not thousands, of citrus growers will go out of business in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a long history of imports of frozen orange juice from Brazil at a fraction of the cost that our growers&mdash;and our growers are efficient&mdash;can produce their fruit. We have had a history where Australia has successively reduced tariff protection against Brazilian orange juice. We are now at 10 per cent, reducing to five per cent, whereas the United States has retained its protection at around 47 per cent. The tariff protection in place can be retained so the United States will be able to continue to protect its orange growers. Australia has reduced its tariff protection and under the GATT agreement, which Australia has agreed to, we are not able to retain the concessional tax rate. This is the reason for the government's removal in this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having received the evidence before the committee and having talked to the organisations of the citrus growers who are concerned with the survival of their industry, it is clear that, at a cost of revenue of, say, $20 million, measured  against, as the minister has said previously, $4 billion, we can ensure that the citrus growing industry in Australia does not fall victim to this particular arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has offered a package of $9 million over a number of years. It is quite clear that these funds, which are to be used to generate and increase export activity, will assist some growers, mainly medium and large growers, but they will not assist the small growers who are battling on their 10, 20 or 30 acre lots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the industry should rationalise; that these people, in other words, should get off the land. The committee has received evidence from a representative of the organisation Women in Horticulture that this process will not be easy, that it will be at the cost of unemployment, marriage breakups, suicides and a range of social ills and dislocation in the rural community. I wonder whether the government in its calculations has, in fact, allowed for those social costs in the Riverland and in the Sunraysia district. Is it really aware of what the costs will be?  Does it think that $9 million over a number of years of export assistance will overcome all these problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are approaching this in an extremely responsible way. We are saying that we welcome the benefits of $4 billion to the primary industries across Australia and we do not wish to damage this prospect. However, there are obvious losers and we want to make sure that these losers do not finish up being the ones carrying the can for the government. This amendment is one that the government, the Liberal Party and certainly the National Party should support. Senator Boswell should lead his National Party colleagues into supporting this particular amendment, if the National Party's commitment to its country constituents means anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the evidence. Senator Boswell was at the meeting and we all were at the committee meetings. We know what will be the effects on the industry of the amendments the government has in its bill. This amendment I am moving on behalf of the Australian Democrats will assist that industry to survive and will help overcome some of the social disadvantages which will inevitably follow. If this amendment is rejected, I am offering to senators an alternative amendment on the same sheet which will remove sales tax from both fresh juice and frozen orange juice concentrate. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

There are two choices: the first is to be able to listen to the concerns of the industry and be able to find in favour of the industry; the second is to say, `No, we can't do this because we're not allowed to do it under GATT,' which relates to a decision based on whether or not we should buy orange juice in a frozen concentrated form with mostly water added from overseas or whether we should pay the same price for fresh juice that is produced from oranges grown locally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on Senator Spindler's amendment. I have some sympathy for the citrus growers who will be affected by the Sales Tax (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate this morning, the National and Liberal parties have been placed between a rock and a hard place. If we try to amend the bills in some way and hold up the legislation, then we put at risk the $1 billion worth of trade advantages that Australia will get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFF has asked that these bills go through speedily. If we hold the legislation up, then we could be putting at risk huge trade advantages for the whole of the agricultural industry throughout Australia. It could affect wheat, wool, beef and many other industries. The fact is that a $9 million package&mdash;or $15 million over five years&mdash;is not very successful. Some of the smaller industries have not received the compensation benefits that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out in my speech this morning, in Japan&mdash;a wealthy country but one which is not a big agricultural producer&mdash;the government of the day compensated its farmers with a package of $83 billion. When we compare this figure with that received by the smaller industries in Australia, we see that it is not a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sympathy with Senator Spindler's amendment, but I do not see how we could put at risk this huge trade benefit to agriculture. I hoped that the government would have given a compensation package of around $40 million. That would have allowed the citrus producers to take out the valencia trees and change over to navels. This would have given them access to the whole fruit market, which is opening up. It would have enabled them to remove the trees. I think it takes seven or eight years for new trees to produce. I would have thought that $40 million was an adequate compensation package. But $15 million over five years is not going to get anyone out of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that I am very sorry that the citrus industry in particular&mdash;the tobacco industry will probably get some relief, not so much from the government package but through an agreement between the manufacturers and the growers&mdash;did not get a package that was much higher than the $15 million that was given. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Boswell, I have a certain sympathy with the general thrust of Senator Spindler's argument, but the coalition thinks that the prime aim must be to get these bills through the parliament in order to meet our obligations. More importantly, it will provide us with the opportunities that the World Trade Organisation agreement gives us. So we will not be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put a question to the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), although it does not relate specifically to the bill. It relates to the government's plans for the taxation write-off of expenditure on new horticultural plantations. It is a matter involving the Income Tax Assessment Act rather than the Sales Tax Act. There is a lack of clarity in the government's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask this question on behalf of the coalition, particularly Senator McMullan's good friend Senator Watson. I refer to the write-off of new horticultural plantations that has been announced. The government has also said that there are complex issues that still have to be resolved. I ask some important questions which I do not think ought to be held up by the complexity of the issue. Firstly, does the write-off mean that growers will get the deduction in the year in which the expenditure is incurred? If they will not get it in full in the year in which it is incurred, how many years write-off are envisaged? Secondly, is the write-off provision planned to be a permanent provision or a transitional provision?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why should Senator Short be the only person to ask a question that does relate to the bill? It is very relevant. Because the support of the opposition for the legislation is not contingent on this, I will get the information to Senator Short and Senator Watson in writing, but my clear recollection and understanding of the cabinet decision is that it was endorsed in principle, with the detail to be worked out by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). I do not think that level of detail has been finalised. If there is anything to add, I will get a written advice to Senator Short and Senator Watson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The purpose of the amendment and its impact has been outlined by others, so I will not waste the time of the committee duplicating that. One thing to remember with regard to the situation in the citrus industry is that as well as negatives there are pluses for it in this Uruguay Round. There are export opportunities opening up and I think more will open up as a consequence of the accession of new countries to the World Trade Organisation. It is not a one-way street. There are pluses as well as minuses. We cannot get all the pluses without the minuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That goes to Senator Spindler's point. While we disagree about the detail, I accept the principle that, when we enter into an agreement from which the overwhelming majority benefit but there are some who are disadvantaged, the majority have an obligation to use some of the proceeds to assist those who may have been disadvantaged. I do not disagree with the principle. We diverge on how we ought to implement that principle. It is a matter of public policy, not a matter particularly relating to the World Trade Organisation, and as such it is a reasonable premise from which to start. It is not always capable of being implemented, for all sorts of reasons, but it is not a bad premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what underpins the package of support that the government outlined and which Senator Boswell and others referred to. That support will be implemented over the years. If at the next election the opposition and other parties want to put forward a proposal that the package should be doubled, trebled or more, then it is up to the voters. If they choose that and they get elected to implement that, then the compensation package which we have outlined will be enhanced by the new government. That is the way the democratic process works. The government thinks that the package it has put up is reasonable. Whatever one's views about the rest of the WTO are, it is a sovereign decision for the government to decide how much money it is going to spend on certain compensation packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry spoke articulately about the problems of the industry and why the sales tax concession measures were pursued. This is in addition to the problems with the GATT&mdash;and I am not going to shy away from that&mdash;and in addition to the revenue implications. Both of those issues are serious. He put the case better than I can because he has been so closely involved with the industry. While the wish behind Senator Spindler's amendment is to assist the citrus industry, it does not go very far to solving any of the problems the industry has. A very small actual increase will flow to the growers out of a very substantial cost to the revenue, assessed at $24 million. That is of the order that Senator Spindler speculated. It is difficult to be too precise, but the best estimate the government can make is that it will be about $24 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three problems. The government thinks it is a measure that does not really address the problems confronting the industry. The government believes the industry would be much better off taking advantage of its compensation package and those sales tax measures which it has undertaken. Senator Harradine was talking about increasing the revenue from orange juice. We anticipate that this package of measures will reduce the amount of sales tax we get on various forms of orange juice because some of it is taxed now and some is not. The rate is going down for that which is currently taxed and the government's assessment is that the revenue from orange juice and related products will go down, not up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not shy away from those two serious revenue concerns. It is a very difficult time to be talking about reducing the revenue. It is a difficult time to be talking about increasing expenditure, but the government has proposed some. The government does not think the amendment addresses the serious problems confronting the industry. We think the adjustment package we are talking about will better position it for a long-term viable future as an industry. But, quite clearly, there is a problem with the consistency of what is proposed in the agreement into which we have entered. The government's obligation is that there should be no less favourable treatment of like foreign and domestic goods in the administration of internal taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a principle that the government has sought to have applied to others in the past and therefore needs consistently to apply it to ourselves even when it is uncomfortable. We cannot have all the pluses and not accept that the same principles need to apply to us. I freely and directly address the fact that one of the constraints upon our capacity to do this is the constraint imposed by the nature of the agreement into which we are seeking to enter through this legislation. We think it is probably not the right way to go even if that were not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we can let the coalition parties get away quite as easily as they have tried to do, saying that they do not want to hold up the bills. If the coalition parties, the National and Liberal parties, were to support this amendment, it would be passed. The House of Representatives is coming back next week. There would be no hold-up. The bill could proceed with that amendment intact. Our citrus industry would be saved. On the basis of orange juice being classified as a food, the argument that the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) is putting forward that it is not GATT friendly does not stand up. So I do not see why the coalition parties should be allowed to get away with the excuse that the bill cannot be held up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask the minister two questions. One of them is: what exactly are the problems of the industry? Does the minister say that there are too many smallholdings and that therefore this is one way of getting rid of them and getting people off the land? If that is the case, so far they have been able to subsist. They have been able to fight their way through, despite protection rates that are much higher in other countries than our own. We have arrived at five per cent now. The United States is 40 per cent plus. Brazil is 35 per cent. Israel is 120 per cent. South Africa is 20 per cent. Japan is 25.5 per cent. Yet we cannot find a way to ensure that our citrus industry continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to address the following: what exactly are the problems and how does he propose to address them? Am I right in saying that the argument is that we have too many smallholdings and we need to get rid of them, we need to rationalise the industry? The other question is: how much government revenue will flow into the government's coffers from the $4 billion worth of extra exports or extra benefits that the government has said will be the result for the primary industries, mainly, under the GATT package?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a short contribution on the citrus industry. There is no doubt that we are aware of the benefits of GATT. We are told that some $700 to $800 billion annually will be pumped into the world trading market and that Australia will make gains of about $2.5 billion. It is very much a wait and see situation as to whether those figures will be brought home, but there is no doubt that Australia does under the theory have comparative advantages, particularly in primary industry. I think of the beef industry, which we are told will benefit the most. But there are industries at the same time that are not helped by GATT in its most pure form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is doubt the citrus industry is one such industry. It needs help, and the package is unsatisfactory. A measly $9 million is going towards the restructuring, the market diversification, of the industry and it is just not enough, particularly as the industry has the potential, I am told, of some $1 billion to $2 billion in the export market. So the government has failed the citrus industry and, again, the many family farmers. But it will be very quick to tax them by way of fuel tax. Even the mooted wealth tax is back on the agenda in the upcoming budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More is needed to support this industry, and the government has failed. It sent Senator Sherry out on a two-year excursion around the industry. Senator Sherry did a good job. But the government has not taken up his recommendation for a zero sales tax for this industry, which was the preferred position. In cabinet it has treated him like the office boy. Senator Sherry's career has taken a severe setback. He must feel that he has wasted his time on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a question for the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). Was he a friend of Senator Sherry's inside cabinet? We have an industry now that will be brought to its knees because the government package is not satisfactory. Why did the minister not help Senator Sherry, give him a kick along? Truly he has wasted his time over the last two years, or however long this committee has been going around the countryside. He has been making a good fellow of himself but he has not been able to deliver. He should not think that he can ever turn up to the citrus areas again, because he has been a great disappointment. It is not his fault; he has been treated like the office boy. </PARA>

Senator Spindler knows that the party I represent that holds the seat of Mallee in Victoria has great difficulty in supporting the GATT bills under this form, but we know that under the principle of GATT there is a chance for primary industry to benefit as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond firstly to Senator Spindler's points but in the process try to pick up what Senator McGauran said. In opening I shall respond to one thing that Senator McGauran said. I understand the frustrations of life as a parliamentary secretary. It is a matter in which I have some personal expertise. I am sure Senator Sherry would prefer life to be otherwise and I am very confident that after the next election for him it will be. But he has done an excellent job. Let me deal with Senator McGauran's questions first now that I have got halfway into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry will be chairing a task force continuing to look at these issues. So we will not be waiting 12 months. The task force will be set up. As a result of the cabinet's decision, Senator Sherry will be chairing it and it will have an ongoing brief to look at the implementation of the package. It is not on the basis that we expect him to come back to cabinet in 12 months needing some further change, because we do not think that will be the case. But there is a task force and if it finds that circumstances have changed he, through the minister for primary industry, has the capacity to respond to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me not pretend, in response to Senator Spindler's question, that I come before you as the world's expert on the citrus industry or the government's expert on the industry. The package and the elements that have been chosen fundamentally have been driven by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and his parliamentary secretary in consultation with the Treasurer (Mr Willis), and that is as it should be. So I do not bring these bills forward in the sense that I am the world's expert on the citrus industry. Senator Sherry said it better than I could. In terms of a serious response, I would suggest to those who wish to pursue that that they should have a look at his speech in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that I was referring to when I said that this did not meet the major problem is that this is an industry that is highly&mdash;perhaps we should say excessively&mdash;dependent on the domestic juice sector, and the sales tax concessions which might lead it to focus even more on this sector actually lead it in the wrong direction. That is what we mean when we say that the tax concession does not solve the problem. It is not to do with how many people are in the industry, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry spoke about those sorts of issues; he has expertise in that area. That was not the matter to which I was referring when I spoke about the major problems. I was trying to be brief, and that is why I did not go into detail. It is not possible to assess the revenue implications for the Australian government of the WTO package, but it is incontrovertible that if it adds to economic growth and incomes are therefore higher the government's tax revenue will be higher. Without trying to put a number on it, it is incontrovertibly true that that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up some comments made by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). The minister has just said that the citrus industry is excessively dependent on the domestic juice sector. In giving evidence to the committee, the industry indicated that that is the nub of the problem in that, as a result of these changes to the trade arrangements, we will find that the juicing industry in Australia will all but disappear. That will be with the exception of companies such as Sunburst which, in order to make the most of the capital that it has recently invested in Australia, will continue to use the juice from Australian growers. I wonder whether that situation will last until the capital needs replacing and whether that part of the industry will then go. Basically, it looks like the juicing sector of the Australian citrus industry will go down the toilet, apart from those companies which, to make the most of recent capital investment, will continue to use it until they are either bought out or find that they need to replace that capital; and then perhaps they will make other decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recognised during the committee hearing that we cannot compete with the juice prices of the Brazilian industry. For the reasons that have been mentioned, the Brazilian industry is a capital intensive industry. The labour it uses is a great deal cheaper than Australian labour, and it uses land in a very unsustainable way. It is using the land as a resource that can be depleted. That is the price that we are paying for this particular thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exports that we are talking about are largely exports of whole oranges, and that is a limited portion of the market. The imports that we are talking about are the value added component of industry, that is, the fruit juice. So that is the scenario we are talking about. I did not think that was the way Australian industry was meant to be going&mdash;taking action that destroys our value added industry and places greater reliance on primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue relates to the nature of the changes. It is important that we realise that these changes will basically change the industry forever. I was quite saddened to see that there are still people in the citrus industry who feel that taking out trees within their industry will enable the prices to go up sufficiently so that the rest of the people in the industry will be able to survive. From their point of view, I would like to believe that that was the truth but, sadly, because products such as fruit juice will now be priced internationally rather than domestically, the ability to remove trees within the industry to push up the price will not be there in the same way that it was before. So pulling out the trees simply means that those people who are left become more and more marginal if they are trying to produce for the fruit juice market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very sorry to see that the government is endorsing a situation which will inevitably lead to the situation where we have a small industry which perhaps produces export oranges, with some for the local market&mdash;but even fewer, because a number of growers grow for both. A lot of the oranges we buy when we go to our local fruit and vegetable shop are actually from dual growers&mdash;growers that grow for both purposes. So, in reality, whereas in recent times it has been frequently very difficult for me as a consumer to buy locally produced oranges, it will become more and more difficult to do that in Australia if the juicing sector is damaged in this way. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My long time ambition has been to develop a citrus property on the River Murray as a retirement plan. I have invested all of my available income in this venture, only to find imported juice concentrates are making this difficult.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 900 Riverland citrus growers I represent underpin the working efforts of 6930 Australians, most of whom live in the region. That is, twenty one percent of the total Riverland population and forty-four percent of the regional workforce. . . Without the tax exemption, the Riverland could expect to contribute over three hundred growers [to those forced out of the industry], so threatening the living of over 2500 workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this sort of evidence that the committee received surely must make the government sit up and take notice. When we look at the disparity of revenue, when we look at the future of citrus growers, we realise that the export efforts are going to be hampered on two fronts. A high proportion, or a reasonable proportion at least, of oranges are not of the quality that can be exported as fruit, so there will always be, no matter where a grower is or how efficient a grower is, some that will need to be sold for juice or be left to rot. Alternatively, if a grower is going to export juice, the grower will be met by the Brazilian competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the chamber that the government's position of spending $9 million over five years to develop an export industry for citrus growers is really not terribly realistic.

<PARA>This amendment is an alternative which might be easier for everyone to support because it is GATT friendly. It does not make any distinction between fresh orange juice and orange juice concentrate. We are suggesting that the sales tax should be removed right across the board. We are told by the citrus growers that this would still give them some assistance because they can market their fresh orange juice as a product. Everybody would agree that it is health giving and far superior to the products made from concentrate. </PARA>

I am sure he is now thinking very hard about his responsibility and his party's responsibility to orange growers and to people in rural Australia. This provides a good benchmark with regard to the government's attitude and the coalition's attitude to people in the country who are being pushed around because the government thinks we need to join GATT, without looking at the consequences and without compensating the losers. </PARA>

The bill should be deferred until we are perfectly clear as to what damage the government is doing to people in the country. </PARA>

The fact is that whether we like it or not&mdash;and I do not&mdash;the amendment that Senator Spindler has moved is not supportive of GATT. In fact, it is GATT-illegal. If he wants to move GATT-illegal amendments, he is putting at risk, in his own words, $4 billion worth of trade and $1 billion worth of primary industry trade. I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Spindler's view&mdash;I have even raised it&mdash;that we should block these bills until the government gives a decent compensation package to the citrus industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support a decent adjustment package. I have said time and again that the citrus industry has not been looked after; the tobacco industry has not been looked after. They have made great contributions over the years but now they are being neglected. There is nowhere for us to go. If we block the bills, we could put our world trade obligations at risk. The beef growers, and most primary industries apart from the tobacco growers and the citrus growers, would be very annoyed with us. There is a benefit to Australia of $1 billion a year in primary products and I believe there is $4 billion a year in secondary industry benefit. Therefore, the government should have compensated the losers and guaranteed that the winners gained access to this large world trade market. But what it has done is to give guarantees to the winners without compensating the losers. I am at a loss as to where we go from here. I have sympathy for the 2,500 to 3,000 primary producers of the citrus industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler said that the Australian Democrats were not against GATT. I draw to his attention a statement by Senator Coulter in the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 1167. He said of GATT:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the 1993 equivalent of the 1893 gunboats to China; gunboats to force Chinese trade into the hegemony of European dominance. If it is less physically violent, it is nonetheless the instrument by which the economically powerful seek to dominate and exploit the weak, to dispossess them of their resources and to ensure the unimpeded penetration of the products of rich nations into the markets of the poor.</PARA>
<PARA>And Senator Spindler stands up here and says that the Democrats support GATT! It is very well for Senator Spindler to stand up and seek, in a grubby way, to pretend to rural producers and the citrus people that he is their friend. I point out to anyone who reads this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that it was Senator Spindler and his colleagues who supported and encouraged a massive rise in fuel prices after the last election&mdash;7c a litre&mdash;which raised well over $1 billion, much of it coming from the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Senator Spindler who encouraged the government to bring in superannuation levies, which hit citrus producers and everybody else, and training guarantee levies. He urged the government to forgo its tax cuts, which it largely did at the income tax level. The government's leader is now out encouraging further tax rises on industry and telling the government, `Bring in your increased taxes.' The Democrats will be out there supporting that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler is very selective. When the products of the citrus growers were held up in the recent airport strike, no-one had access to 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. Does Senator Spindler know why? It was because his party supported the removal of 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. So whether we are looking at industrial relations, tax policy or rural policy and live sheep exports, I can tell Senator Spindler that the Democrats cannot hold their heads up in rural Australia. </PARA>

We happen to represent the poorest of all metropolitan and rural seats in Australia.

<PARA>This amendment is simple enough. We have taken the government's definition&mdash;which, we understand, is GATT consistent&mdash;and simply put that class of things in schedule 1, making them tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on the Australian Democrats amendment relating to fresh fruit juice only&mdash;on which we have already voted&mdash;we clearly saw from the government's actions and the opposition's response that there is a way in which GATT and the World Trade Organisation can work against national objectives. I believe that a large number of growers think that this amendment is an appropriate exemption. Fresh fruit juice differs from juice from concentrate. It tastes and feels different; it is healthier. The juice from fresh fruit makes it difficult for foreign growers because they could not easily ship tonnes of oranges used for orange juice to Australia. If they did, the expense would be horrendous, the quality would suffer, and major losses of fruit would result. So they consider it a trade barrier. The fact that it is not an intentional trade barrier does not matter. Because they say that it makes it difficult for them, we have to change our laws to make it easier for them, regardless of the reason those laws are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is GATT and World Trade Organisation consistent. It simply puts all the juice products concerned at the exempt rather than a concessional rate. There is no reason that juice should be taxed at a higher level than coffee. Juice is a food and we recognise that it is far more beneficial to health than coffee is, even though some Greens are well known coffee drinkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also a means of assisting our citrus farmers. There is no need to discriminate against juice in favour of coffee and other drinks. Making juice more attractive to consumers might create an increase in demand that will partially counteract the effect of this bill. The fact that concentrate is included means that Australian concentrate source can be used, and quite a lot of Australian juice goes into concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commending this amendment, I make it very clear that this is the first occasion in dealing with these bills that the government has been asked to deal with an amendment that is clearly not inconsistent and clearly is what the industry is asking for. The minister has mentioned a number of times tonight that there has been extensive consultation with industry. There is not much point having Senator Sherry talking with the citrus industry for over two years if we ignore what has come out of that. That is not what consultation is about. I remind the chamber that the consultation with the footwear, clothing and textile industries was overridden three times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation with industry is about listening to what industry is saying&mdash;listening to what it says are the implications of decisions. If the government can do something here that will assist an industry and will not put in jeopardy the agreement it so dearly wants, there is no excuse for it not supporting this amendment. </PARA>

We believe that while, under GATT, most of our primary industries and some of our other industries will receive benefits, some others will be losers. There is an obligation on the government to assist those which are losers so that the community as a whole can benefit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise specifically in support of this amendment to the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994. The dairy industry is of significant importance to Tasmania. This amendment simply seeks to enable parliament to have some say in the ultimate arrangements that are likely to be made with the WTO as they affect intimately and significantly the affairs of dairy producers. As such, I think it is a reasonable amendment. I believe it is a reasonable exercise of our rights as members of parliament and the rights of parliament as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment for the reasons outlined before. We believe that, when a government representative negotiates on behalf of the government and the Australian community and it comes to the point that a binding agreement or an arrangement which vitally affects trade and economic matters is made, it is appropriate for this parliament to vote on the agreement that is proposed to the extent that it changes the existing legislative position in Australia. That should be done before an agreement is made to join a particular treaty, convention or agreement. It should not be done as part of this package of bills which is being placed before the chamber without substantive debate on the actual GATT issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I state again that, every time the Democrats vote against one of these bills, we are voting not to exclude Australian support for these bills or the accession to GATT; we are voting to register the need to defer consideration of these bills until we know and the Australian community knows exactly what the benefits and the disadvantages are. These have not been placed before the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment. Before I conclude, I wish to briefly comment on the bill before the chamber to which this amendment is being moved. The Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 is an example of where the government has managed to maintain the support for dairy producers in a different way. It simply has restructured the support that dairy producers receive, but essentially the support remains the same. If it was possible with this bill, why was it not possible with some of the other bills where losers are quite clearly defined?</PARA>

Along with the Speaker and Leo McLeay, I represented this parliament at the IPU conference in Copenhagen in September. I spoke about GATT and the effect it would have on Australia and developing countries. I supported the government's position, and I still do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the comments made tonight about the dairy industry. I normally agree with my colleague from Tasmania Senator Harradine, but dairy producers have restructured their industry themselves; they have opened up markets all over the world. If people are so concerned about the dairy industry, why is there so much investment in dairying in Tasmania, for example? Many New Zealand companies have come into Woolnorth. I went to the opening of one of its dairies last Friday afternoon. One dairy alone is milking 1,500 cows in three hours. The company intends to open another four or five dairies like that which have the potential to hold 20,000 dairy cows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, if the industry was in such dire straits and in need of so much assistance, these people from New Zealand and others who are investing in dairy cattle, like UMT, would not be investing so much money in that area. They know the future for dairying and the markets that are emerging, particularly in Asia. They know the markets. They know their cost structures. They know what the government is doing. They know what the effects of GATT are going to be. These negotiations have been going on for years. They know the effects it will have upon them. They have every confidence in this industry. I believe any efforts by senators to alter what has been known to everybody for quite some time would certainly not work in their favour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an interesting precedent, I would think. I have not heard the opposition say in the past that, if the government were to take an action which is likely to impact on a particular industry which happens to be doing well at the time, that means that it should be less liable to ask for some kind of compensation for the damage that is being done. I certainly know that some dairy producers in Western Australia are doing quite well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the arrangements under the World Trade Organisation do impact on the dairy industry, then I do not see that that would actually mean that we should not be asking that if there is damage that damage should be compensated. I am not sure what precedent we are setting if we say that if an industry is doing okay and there is damage done to it then it should be ineligible for assistance. There was a strong call for assistance to the mining industry in relation to the fuel tax debate last year. I did not actually hear many opposition senators say that because the mining corporations are quite well off that should be a basis upon which that industry is not compensated. </PARA>

The measure does include the extension of the support payments to the dairy industry to at least 30 June 2000. There are certain other measures in the legislation in that regard.

<PARA>The dairy industry arrangements are another potential casualty of the World Trade Organisation. They are arrangements that government, industry and parliament have spent considerable time on to establish and get right in terms of the dairy industry and the public interest. Yet, again, they are World Trade Organisation inconsistent. Why is that? Australia is already a very low tariff nation and we have in place commitments to cut our dairy export support program substantially from 22 per cent in 1992-93 to 10 per cent in the year 2000. This is a decline of 55 per cent over the term of the adjustment set by the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are only required to cut the value of support by 36 per cent over that period. So what is wrong? It would seem that once again our negotiators are so keen to act as the purest of the pure in these negotiations that they are prepared to go further than the industry or the World Trade Organisation felt was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is there that we run foul of the requirement to reduce the quantity of export subsidies that must also decline by 21 per cent. So back to the drawing board. It does not matter that we are a low tariff nation already committed to surpassing requirements in many respects; we are still in violation according to the government. I wonder how many other nations will be as scrupulous as we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder why there is such a hurry to put everything right immediately, even if it means pushing this legislation through before any alternative provisions have been put in place. The government has said it will put alternatives in place. Unfortunately, while it can push all kinds of other bills into the Senate as matters of urgency, it does not feel the same urgency in regard to these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not, especially since in agriculture it appears that there are transitional arrangements? Improvements must be made but not necessarily before the World Trade Organisation is even established. The export subsidies must be reduced but only bit by bit over six years. It seems there may be time to get the new arrangements through. The government insists that  the bills must be pushed through and our arrangements become perfect before we even start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that, in relation to the agricultural subsidies, the World Trade Organisation imposes a proportional reduction on every member. It does not recognise that nations are starting at very different levels. Australia can end up with almost no export support but may be competing, even at the end of the round, with nations having more subsidies than we started with. It seems that there can be no leeway for a nation like Australia, which is far ahead of most nations, to provide proper alternatives in the next year when there is something wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in the committee hearing on these bills, the dairy industry expressed concern that the new arrangements were not in place or even drafted and tabled. It is left in the invidious position of having to give up its arrangements and any negotiating powers it may have and simply trust the government to do the right thing by it. It is willing but worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that putting this sort of pressure on the dairy industry is improper. We believe that the removal of one set of provisions on the promise that the new provisions are in the pipeline is inadequate. The government has shown, and shows in these bills, that it is willing to sacrifice various sectors of the community such as the citrus growers, the rental people and so on. There is no real assurance that it may not decide that the dairy industry can be sacrificed or partially sacrificed or that that damage that the dairy industry has incurred will not be fully compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issue of concern to the dairy industry was that there should be a smooth transition between the existing and the new provisions. Since the new provisions are not even on the table, there already seems to be a hitch. Hopefully, this will not translate into a major disruption of the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second amendment makes the action of this bill and the termination of the existing regime conditional on the provision of alternative arrangements. We believe that the passage of this bill with these conditions should demonstrate good faith and a commitment to the changes required, even if the bill was not commenced with the WTO start-up date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is not set to commence in any case until at least 1 July 1995. It has six months to get its legislation in place. If it cannot do so by the passage of this bill as amended, it can at least demonstrate to the WTO that it will put it in place at the earliest possible date. This will also assure the dairy industry a smooth transition between regimes and create some security for that industry. It will relieve the pressure to pass legislation hastily to avoid harming the industry, although the legislation should be considered important. We believe this is a reasonable amendment and should not pose a problem for World Trade Organisation entry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 and my amendments. In this bill we are being asked to extend our patent rights in a variety of ways. The move has certainly not come from parliament. I have not heard any calls or received constituent letters calling for these changes or asking us to support this as an issue. In fact, the only representation from industry I received was from the Australian Biotechnology Association and it was unfavourable. However, many aid and development groups expressed strong objection and asked that we oppose the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several issues at stake here and they will probably not be debated on their merits. As with all of these bills, the overriding consideration is that we must have this legislation to join the World Trade Organisation. Yet we have the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) and others insisting that the World Trade Organisation does not affect our sovereignty. When we start acting to pass legislation on an issue not because the issue is important or needs to be addressed but because we need to accomplish another objective like selling beef, then where is sovereignty? When there is no independence or ability to look at issues on their merits there can be no sovereignty. When our desire to sell beef and coal forces us to change our patent regime to reverse onus of proof I do not see a great deal of independence. Our actions in respect of an unrelated issue are conditional on the requirements of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is this bill an issue? Most basically we see an agenda of the GATT and now the World Trade Organisation is to extend patent rights. TRIPS, the trade related intellectual property regime, was a major regulatory issue pushed by the United States on behalf of transnational industry. Besides the very great implications for control of genetic and other living resources, there are many ethical issues here. These will not be examined and the amendments are only to slavishly bring Australian law into line with the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major issue in relation to patenting and its effect on free scientific information. I am sorry that Senator Coulter is not here for this debate. I know how strong his concerns on this issue are. In pushing for patents we are basically establishing a stronger and stronger regime of what is called proprietary information&mdash;knowledge that is owned. That is exactly the opposite of what science has striven for with its emphasis on free scientific information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International patent law has been a highly contentious issue. The reason and rationale for granting patents and the validity of subjects of patents are not consistent. The ethics are not clear; nor is there any clear regime as a model, although the United States proposes its law as the global standard. There are strong implications for transfer of technology to developing nations&mdash;human rights and other implications in terms of other international agreements, both those relating to intellectual property and others, such as UNCSD for climate change and biodiversity agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the morality and the outcomes of the TRIPS regime, TRIPS purports to protect discoverers and inventors. In fact, it protects corporations capable of gaining patent rights. The recent death of the Philippine discoverer of the drug erythromycin after having unsuccessfully fought for years for some control or return from the drug company that patented it highlights the situation. Patents have been granted in the United States in courts for basic monoclonal antibody technology using development of most modern vaccines in spite of the fact that the innovation was made by two British scientists and published as free scientific information. The discoverers have received no benefit. The issue of assuring any benefit to the real discoverers or inventors is conveniently ignored under patent law. The level of proper compensation has also not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Granting of exclusive patent rights grants corporations monopoly control over that product. Companies can determine what rate of monopoly, rent or super profit they receive by price setting. They can determine the availability and the cost of licensing. They are not obliged to allow anyone else to produce it, even if they do not. In this sense it also allows companies to hold monopoly control of technology. If a company decides a market is too small, as drug companies do, there is no obligation to make the drug available in a country and no obligation to issue a licence to allow others to do so; likewise with technology such as the Sarich two-stroke. An invention can simply remain unavailable in Australia because of marketing considerations. In fact, there is no obligation to produce an innovative device at all. Many patents are bought and held by corporations to prevent others from making similar products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is granting a totally unethical control to others. It is also unproductive, particularly when patent rights control the ability to build on basic design innovation. There are certainly strong grounds to question extension of these rights. No-one was allowed to speak on the issue at the hearing, although there was at least one person who would have liked to have spoken. The haste with which such hearings are put together reduces the ability to discover the full and complex issues associated with things such as patents. The implications of patents on these various issues that I have talked about require much greater and in-depth consideration. This matter could have done with an entire inquiry all of its own under intellectual property. The committee has done itself a great disservice in the amount of time and consideration that has been afforded these important considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 135 of the principal act on patents sets out the reasonable requirements of the public. This is an excellent provision in this far-thinking legislation and it establishes some measures of public responsibility that patent holders must meet. The primary purpose of section 135 is to assume that a company granted an Australian patent does not use its monopoly right to exclude the Australian public from that innovation, that it does not prevent others from making an innovation available if it does not make it available in Australia itself, and that it does not charge monopoly prices for its goods, that is, it must set a reasonable price. If such companies do not do these things, under section 133 they can be taken to court, and compulsory licence for someone else to develop the innovation can be issued or, under section 134, the violator can have his patent taken away. We think these are reasonable measures to protect the public from some of the worst abuses of industrial patents. I now wish to seek advice on the amendments which I will be moving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I want to raise something for the minister to consider. Mr Temporary Chairman, in your previous position as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, you will recall that in 1990 that committee was considering the Patents Bill 1990. At that time, Mr Kevin Andrews, who is extremely competent in this area of patents, wrote to you noting that the bill did not appear to preclude the possibility of grant of a patent in Australia for biological processes for the production of humans, their components, or higher life forms. He said that the absence of such provision appeared to leave open the possibility that property rights in human beings might be granted by way of patent in Australia were the bill passed in its current form. Mr Andrews then detailed various High Court decisions and decisions of international courts relevant to this question. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, Mr Temporary Chairman, you will recall that I moved an amendment to the Patents Act to prevent the patenting in Australia, under the Patents Act, of certain human life forms.

<PARA>We think that these amendments are reasonable measures to protect the public from some of the worst abuses of industrial patents. This set of amendments is designed to allow a person to bring a patent holder to court for the same breaches of the reasonable requirements of the public and seek a more general order that the patent holder should meet those reasonable requirements or have the patent revoked. The major difference is that the person making the complaint does not need to be someone wishing a compulsory licence. It can be a member of the general public, a representative of a consumer group, or the Prices Surveillance Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill further amends sections 133 and 134 of the act to stipulate the court's powers in a number of respects, such as the length of time required for redress. It also significantly weakens the power of redress. We do not feel that this is appropriate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the minimal debates we have had in this chamber some aspects of the problems of research and knowledge were discussed. A lot of that discussion was about public interest and the need for us not to be moving away from the benefits of research and what can be done about the move that is pushing more and more into corporations controlling the research that is being done in this country. It seems that if we totally commoditise knowledge in our country, we are leaving it open for the owning of knowledge to become much more important than actually producing, creating, and sharing knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will relate to the chamber one example that springs to mind which is happening right at this moment in Western Australia. Scientists who wish to study the flora and fauna in our state forests&mdash;that is, forests that do not belong to anyone in particular; they belong to everybody&mdash;are required to obtain a licence from the Department of Conservation and Land Management. That department has made a bit of a name for itself because it has tried to lead the world in the commoditisation of genetic material by allowing the patenting and the selling of a subproduct of a species&mdash;the smoke bush&mdash;as a cancer cure, on the basis that we will get $2 million or $3 million worth of benefits. Some pharmaceutical company will make a great deal more. We have given away&mdash;in reality, we have sold&mdash;a piece of our natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that, the requirement to gain a permit to study in the forest requires a person to sign an agreement with the Department of Conservation and Land Management which says that the information the person gains from the study is owned by the Department of Conservation and Land Management. This means that it claims proprietary right for any information that that person gains on any species. The department requires the right to patent it before anybody else does and can stop that person publishing any material as a result of the studies. The material could be something that is not to do with things that CALM is doing at the moment, because it is not doing much in relation to conservation. It could actually have something to do with saving the forests. It is to do with patents but it is also to do with copyright, and we will get to that as well. It basically means that CALM can stop that person publishing the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the kind of thing that is possible under the new rules. We can buy and sell species. We can hold the benefits of information. We can even stop it from being published if it is not in the interest of those people who are co-owners of the copyright. I think it is really important that we begin to see what it is we might be leading into when we strengthen the ability of patents to withhold information and stop the free flow of the scientific information and ideas that are so necessary for where we have got to in the world today. I commend my amendments Nos 2 to 9 to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are moving into a very complex area. Senator Margetts has made a lengthy contribution in two parts: firstly, about the general issue of patents and then, more specifically, about these amendments. I appreciate that dealing with the amendments in bulk is an attempt to get things done more quickly, but the amendments cover a lot of different issues and I do not want to traverse the detail. If we look at amendment No. 2 first, it strangely seeks to go beyond what is required for the purposes of the act. At the moment our view is that the bill makes reasonable provision for the recognition of reasonable requirements of the public. The added proposal in the amendment is unclear; it makes the situation uncertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can look at amendments Nos 3, 5, 6 and 7 together to expedite proceedings, we think there is a problem with these with regard to issues like burden of proof. While on the one hand we could say there is a problem with these because the amendments probably result in our failing to meet our World Trade Organisation obligations, this is not a circumstance in which, as I am advised, we are having imposed upon us policies we would not otherwise have adopted. My advice is that these are essentially in a form that we would have wished to do ourselves as a matter of domestic policy. Although this comes in under the World Trade Organisation package, patents do not come under my personal portfolio responsibilities, so I do not deal with them in a day-to-day way. My advice from those who do is that this is the manner in which we would, in any event, have dealt with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit surprised why there is a proposal to oppose clause 4, because that is the clause which preserves natural justice principles in respect of infringement proceedings. I do not understand why we would want to oppose that. That seems to be something, even if one were opposed to the general thrust of the legislation, that one might wish to maintain. I do not want to pursue it clause by clause too much. I think we should deal with it in bulk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with amendment No. 8 is that it causes some transitional problems. That is essentially what it is dealing with. I do not think that enhances the bill in any way, in fact, to the contrary. Clause 9 goes a bit beyond what we need to do for the WTO. Compulsory licences, which in some ways are the vehicle for dealing with some of the concerns that Senator Margetts has raised, seem to me to be an inappropriate way of handling this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deal with it cryptically because of the time, we do not support any of these amendments broadly because they either go beyond the thrust of what is needed for the World Trade Organisation or cut across the policy approach that the government would wish to take or, in one particular instance, take out what we thought would wish to be maintained in terms of protecting the natural justice rights of parties. </PARA>

The continuing thrust of policy has been and is to maintain a balance between the incentive to innovate by giving rights to the innovator and the protection of the public interest. It is always a difficult balance to strike. To pretend there is some magical objective measure, I think, is a bit ambitious. That is the balance we are going to strike. If that is what Senator Margetts is looking for in terms of what the principles are, that is the most thumbnail description I can give. Perhaps the question was more about process as well. If that is what Senator Margetts wanted to know, perhaps she could clarify it and I will come back to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is our view that it is necessary to strengthen the public good aspect of patent law, that we must ensure that patent holders do not profit at the expense of benefits that should be obtained by the public.

From what I was saying before, it seems that with regard to those people involved in research, be it university research, CSIRO research or other areas of research in which people are deeply committed to what they are doing, not just to making money, there is a contrary opinion about the kind of direction taken by the current Australian policy in relation to intellectual property, which seems to be pushed in this way by the new trade relations.

<PARA>This amendment seeks to impose an additional requirement of the public. It is to ensure that the actual innovators in patent applications receive some benefit from their work. This is the rationale for patents, after all. Instead, we see, for example, the huge pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly patenting the work of a Philippine researcher who discovered erythromycin. Eli Lilly made billions and the innovator got nothing. What makes this situation more sad is that the researcher asked Lilly to pay a royalty into a trust to fund medical research and researchers in the Philippines rather than into a trust for himself. After nearly four decades of fighting for some payment in recognition, Abelardo Aguilar died recently without ever receiving anything from the drug giant. </PARA>

In order for people to put their opinions where their mouths are, shall we say, I would urge the support of my amendment No. 10 to make sure that we in Australia do act to make sure that some equitable sharing of the benefits of such innovations do go to the innovator and to the patent holder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like some explanation. I presume that the opposition and the government are going to support this amendment because I have not heard any reasonable opposition to it. It is an amendment to section 135 of the principal act, which deals with the reasonable requirements of the public, and adds another requirement which, on the face of it, appears to be eminently reasonable and is stated in Senator Margetts's amendment No. 10. The amendment simply states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That amendment is to be included as paragraph (d) in section 135. I think it is a perfectly reasonable situation. The example given by Senator Margetts is one that we should all contemplate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer the last question. Perhaps I cannot answer as sweepingly as Senator Harradine asked his question either. Although there are some initiatives which, as I said before, the government may as a matter of policy wish to implement in any event, we are seeking to bring this piece of legislation&mdash;which the parliament dealt with recently in the way that Senator Harradine outlined when he asked me a previous question&mdash;into line with the international body of patent law for the reasons that we discussed when he asked me the previous question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This goes beyond what that requires. In the first instance, I have concern about a process of legislating that involves an amendment which none of us has previously seen. We are concerned about dealing with a bit of legislation that we have only had for six weeks. This is an amendment that we have not had for six hours, and we are not across all the detail. Trying to make a sweeping, general amendment to deal with a particular case, however serious, is always a tricky proposition. It is not something that we ought to be rushing in to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here essentially about contracts entered into between innovators and the patent holder. There is protection in the act against fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining the patents, so some of those problems are effectively dealt with by the existing subclauses of clause 138. I do not think, therefore, we need to dash in and pass this, which would involve the government establishing a process to determine the reasonableness of contracts freely entered into, with the protections that exist in other parts of the legislation. I do not think it is a direction in which we should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if there is a broad problem in the operation of the Australian legislation that suggests that the sort of problem referred to in the Philippines might occur in Australia, it would be a bit more useful if we had a committee of the Senate or some such body look at it and come up with a considered proposal to apply, in Australian circumstances, the Australian law. That might deal with the problems that are outlined. We should not pluck this off the shelf. On the face of what was described, it sounds a very serious problem. But it is not something that either this legislation was ever intended to address or that we are confident this amendment addresses without creating unintended consequences of which we are not aware. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before talking about the substantive issues involved in amendment 11, I would like to make a couple of comments in relation to the subtle and less subtle pressures that have been applied to me in the last however long about the time being taken for this particular debate. I would like to point out that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a number of other people whose opinions are important to me, the debate on this series of bills is probably the most important debate to have occurred in this chamber and will be for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity to take the time to deal with these issues is not just to put on the record the concerns of those people who have not been heard to date; it is also to hear the government's responses to those concerns. This may be the only time that such responses are put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be of no great joy to me if, in years to come, what we are saying is proven to be perfectly true, but it is extremely important that the debate takes place and that the substantive issues that we are addressing go on the public record. The calling of divisions is not for the sake of enjoying myself. I would rather be anywhere than standing here in this chamber at the moment. Like anybody else, I would like to be at home, but I believe that these issues are so important that we must take the time to debate them correctly and we must go on the record as to where we stood on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk now about my amendment 11. A major issue of concern regarding the trade related intellectual property regime has been the impact on developing nations. There is a wide variety of concerns in relation to intellectual property. A major concern for developing nations is the impact of trade related intellectual property on technology transfer. There are many cases where nations feel that they are effectively denied technology. From the perspective of the South, in the old days the North used tariffs to keep trade dominance in manufactured goods. Now that these goods are made in the South and knowledge intensive goods are produced in the North, the North is pushing for low tariffs and strong protection for intellectual property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably somewhat naive but while it is true that at present a lot of knowledge intensive industry is found in the North, that is not exclusively the case. Major developments, such as the Indian Silicon Valley, show that knowledge based industries can be located anywhere. The point is that, although these industries might be located in India, the result is not necessarily a great rise in wellbeing for Indians, a reduction in poverty, or the transfer of technology. A company may develop a good and ship it out in such a way that nobody other than the workers will see much of that good. They will remain shanty dwellers and rickshaw wallahs on the edge of the city&mdash;likewise in the developed world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to ensure recognition of the impact that changes to trade related intellectual property will make on less developed countries and that there is the chance to deal with those on an equitable basis. I remind honourable senators that there is a one-year transition period for intellectual property measures.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber of the previous amendment, where there would be a case only when a complaint was heard and found valid. So we are not talking about changing everything that has ever existed. We are talking about equity&mdash;equity in dealing with intellectual property as it relates to less developed nations&mdash;and about taking into consideration things such as the United Nations agenda 21 program. </PARA>

Having been five times elected and having served in the last seven parliaments, the time has come for me to pursue with more focus some writing and research interests I have had for many years.

It is time now for me to spend much more time with my wife, Kathy, and our three sons&mdash;Joshua, Matthew and Nathan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a brief speech on the adjournment in lieu of Dr Michael Wooldridge, who would have made this speech in the House of Representatives if it had been sitting and if he had been here, to note on behalf of the coalition that today, 1 December, is World AIDS Day. It is a day which gives us an opportunity to reflect on a very serious disease, HIV-AIDS. It is a day when we remember those who have died from AIDS, both here in Australia and around the world; when we express our concern for all those living with HIV infections and those with full-blown AIDS; when we recognise the challenges faced by loved ones and other carers of people with AIDS; and when we recognise the achievements and efforts of the researchers, medical practitioners, other health workers, community service providers and volunteer helpers who have each made their contribution in the battle against HIV-AIDS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have had our share of AIDS related misery. Statistics reported in the October 1994 AIDS surveillance report indicate that, up to 30 June 1994, over 18,000 new cases of HIV infection had been diagnosed in Australia and, sadly, over 3,500 people have died of AIDS in that same period&mdash;523 of these in the period from 1 July 1993 until 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators in this chamber have not seen anybody die of AIDS, I must say that it is the worst death I have ever seen. A friend I went to university with died of AIDS. When he first became sick I thought he would die but he lived for another 24 weeks in a state that was nothing short of tragic. To think that so many other people have died like that fills me with grief&mdash;I think that is the only word one could use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in Australia there is reason for hope. The incidence of HIV infection has declined markedly since its peak in the late 1980s as preventative measures have been increasingly adopted by groups in the community most at risk of HIV. Consequently, it is to be hoped that the annual death rate from AIDS will fall in the next few years from its current peak. Although, as the President of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Tony Keenan, has pointed out, this is no reason for complacency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World AIDS Day also invites to us look beyond our own shores. It is a day to look at the death and misery caused by AIDS in the Third World, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa but increasingly in South and South-East Asia. What we see there is a tragic picture. As I mentioned, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in conjunction with World Vision, has for the past week and a half been visiting sub-Saharan Africa. The stories that I have got back from his office about what he is discovering there are nothing short of tragic. I am sure he will tell us more and report more to the House of Representatives when he returns next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994, World Health Organisation data indicated that there are over 850,000 reported cases of full-blown AIDS worldwide, with 301,000 of these in Africa and 5,500 in Asia. Unreported cases may run into several millions. But the World Health Organisation has estimated the cumulative incidence of HIV infections in these regions as being of even more frightening proportions. In late 1993, the most reliable estimates suggested that over nine million people in sub-Saharan Africa were infected by HIV. In South and South-East Asia, it was estimated that at the same time over two million people were infected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worrying trend is that, while the rate of incidence of HIV infection and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to largely level off, the rate in South and South-East Asia will continue to rise alarmingly. Worldwide, the WHO estimates that the 14 million figure in late 1993 for cumulative HIV cases is projected to rise to 30 to 40 million by the year 2000, the vast majority of these occurring in Africa and Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as part of the affluent developed world, can play its part in assisting those in the Third World who are fighting an uphill struggle against HIV and AIDS. The sheer scale of the Third World problem puts the size of our national HIV-AIDS research effort into better perspective. I also acknowledge the role of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau in its support of HIV-AIDS prevention and support programs, particularly in Asia. Praise is particularly due to the efforts of the international non-government organisations, like World Vision, which give on the ground support to people living with HIV-AIDS in places like Uganda and Rwanda where medical facilities and support infrastructure are woefully inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also the contribution of individual Australians, medical professionals, aid workers and financial donors to the efforts of such organisations. AIDS is a problem of our time. There is as yet no vaccine or cure for HIV and AIDS, and people the world over will continue to suffer and die. In Australia we should use World AIDS Day as a chance to reflect on the effects of HIV-AIDS not only in our Australian community but also in those parts of the world less fortunate than ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak in the adjournment debate but in view of the significant announcement by Senator Teague tonight that he will not be seeking re-election, and because he and I are senators from South Australia, I would like to make a couple of brief comments. We acknowledge that you have had a long period in the Senate and that you are the longest serving senator from South Australia since you were elected in 1977 and began your term in 1978. I think you have been here for seven terms which clearly makes you one of two or three longest serving senators in this place. This gives you some idea how quick the turnover is or how rapid our mortality rate is as senators, particularly with the vagaries of politics in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish you, your wife and family all the best when you finish up here when the term ends, whenever that may be&mdash;whether there is a double dissolution or not. You have set out tonight what you will do&mdash;I will not say in your retirement&mdash;in your next act of life, which is quite commendable. Though we are on different sides of politics and we probably have different styles in the way we go about politics from time to time, I recognise in this parliament that you have genuinely been one of the few small `l' Liberal members of the Liberal Party&mdash;an ever decreasing number, unfortunately, for Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time, people like Peter Baume, Chris Puplick, David Hamer and Alan Missen have gone. If I wanted to be cynical about it, the fact that there are diminishing numbers of small `l' Liberals in the Liberal Party enhances the Labor Party's opportunities electorally. It is bad for Australian politics that the major non-Labor Party in Australian politics is ever decreasing its breadth by the departure of such senators as yourself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Jones has said, you have had a very distinguished career in the area of foreign affairs. It was a surprise to some of us that you did not end up as chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that your public support for an Australian head of state has not led to pressure from within the Liberal Party of South Australia for you to step down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to reflect on your party and politics in terms of your departure and make the very strong point that particularly from my portfolio's perspective, where I am in contact with thousands of people monthly in the broader community, there is a need for recognition of the importance of social issues and of the question of the identity of Australia. The question of a republic which comes with that is very much alive and kicking in our community. As you said by way of interjection, it is to the young and to the future that those issues will be left, but I do not think it will be all that far down the track or we will be all that much older before those issues are addressed because of the changes in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think politics does need some small `l' liberals on your side, a viable group to put pressure not just on this side of parliament but also on your side of parliament. In many ways the public is frustrated at the moment by the dereliction by the conservative side of politics of that huge area of small `l' issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is at a time like this that we should reflect also on Steele Hall. Senator Teague, you are leaving. Steele Hall is leaving. Senator Hill tried to take over Steele Hall's seat. I was also at university when Raymond Steele Hall started the liberal movement. He did so for a couple of reasons. Firstly, he wanted a more progressive Liberal Party. Secondly, he wanted to ensure that the conservative, dry right wing&mdash;in fact, it was the League of Rights connection in South Australia&mdash;was driven out of the Liberal Party. In a sense I pity Steele Hall because he took it a long way but the circle has turned full way round. We now find him leaving, you leaving and people like Senator Hill not able to get to the lower house. It is a bad reflection and a sad reflection on politics in our state that the Liberal Party has gone so far to the right that it is vacating that very important ground, particularly for a state like South Australia, where those issues have been fundamental. </PARA>

At university we used to discuss issues quite often and when he went on to do his doctorate at Cambridge we used to keep in touch by correspondence on the political issues of the day.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government's commitment to achieving equity in higher education is set out in its national plan, published in 1990 under the title A Fair Chance for All. This plan identified six groups of people disadvantaged in their participation in higher education. People with disabilities form one of these groups. Under the national plan, higher education institutions have been asked by the Commonwealth to develop equity plans which set out equity objectives and targets, strategies for achieving these objectives and performance measures to assess the progress of equity activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Institutions were asked to develop their plans in the light of A Fair Chance for All and institutional plans were linked with targeted funds provided under the Higher Education Equity Program (HEEP). In their plans institutions are now required to set specific equity objectives and indicate the strategies to be used in achieving them. In 1990, $3.5m a year was made available through HEEP to support measures to increase participation in higher education by disadvantaged groups. In 1994 $5m was disbursed to institutions through HEEP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grants under HEEP are allocated as `seed' funds to encourage the introduction of innovative developments as a means of increasing the attractiveness of higher education for designated equity groups. This funding approach reflects the Commonwealth's view that effective institutional management should place a priority on access and equity when determining the allocation of its operating resources. It also reflects a view that funding of equity activities in institutions should be met from normal operating grants provided by the Commonwealth to fund recurrent activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the high costs of meeting the special support needs of students with a disability, the advantages to be derived from a co-operative approach have also been recognised. Since 1991 the Commonwealth has provided funding for groups of institutions to develop co-operative support measures for this target group. An amount of $544,000 was earmarked under HEEP in 1994 for co-operative support measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the Commonwealth commissioned an investigation into equity and general performance indicators in higher education, conducted by Lin Martin (Flinders University). It is anticipated that the recommendations of this study which reported earlier this year will lead to a significant improvement in institutions' capacity to undertake nationally consistent monitoring of higher education participation of equity groups in the future. Performance against the proposed indicators in the study will be measured over the next three years, as a means of trialling the effectiveness of the indicators. Implementation of the indicators will enable comparisons of institutional performance to be made. The development of a standard set of performance indicators will also enable funding under HEEP to be allocated on the basis of institutional achievement of outcomes for equity groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Through its initiatives outlined in (1) above the Government has demonstrated clearly its commitment to improving access to, and success in, the higher education system for identified sections of the community disadvantaged in terms of access, including people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An evaluation of HEEP conducted by my Department in 1993 found that since the late 1980s women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds have continued to improve their overall participation in higher education. For example, the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students has increased from 1,933 in 1987 to 5,578 in 1993. Most of the HEEP national targets for the first two groups for 1992 had been met and, given a continuation of current trends, the evaluation report stated it was likely that most of the 1995 targets would also be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evaluation also reported that, because of data limitations, progress towards meeting the 1995 target for people with a disability could not be measured. Universities provide a range of services for students with a disability through their equity programs, including special equipment and facilities and special support services, such as note-takers and interpreters. Data problems are being addressed through the Lin Martin study as noted above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the remaining two equity groups (people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and people from rural and isolated areas) specific participation targets were not set. These groups benefit, however, from the strategies adopted by universities under the equity program which include alternative entry arrangements and bridging and supplementary courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government has addressed the Andrews report in a number of ways. The Regional Disability Liaison Officer initiative is currently being implemented and from 1994 funding of $750,000 per annum has been provided for this purpose. Commonwealth funding under HEEP was also increased by $1 million in 1994, boosting the capacity of institutions to meet infrastructure support costs for students with disabilities. As part of the implementation of their equity plans, institutions are expected to fund ongoing support infrastructure activities from their normal operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the provision of expensive infrastructure is one means of creating a more readily accessible and sympathetic environment in higher education institutions, an additional means of assisting students with disabilities is through the Government's Open Learning Initiative (OLI). To underscore its commitment to ensuring wider access to the benefits of higher education, in the 1992 Budget $52 million was provided over the 1993-95 triennium to support the OLI. The increased flexibility of study through the Open Learning Agency offers opportunities for people whose access to higher education is restricted, either because they do not meet entry requirements or because of personal circumstances, such as, family responsibilities or disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the initiative, an Open Learning Electronic Support Service (OLESS) is being developed which will allow students, including those with disabilities, to communicate electronically with other students and academic staff. They will also be able to access library services and administrative information electronically. Students will be able to gain access to OLESS from their homes or from community-based facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The above initiatives demonstrate the substantial progress made by the Commonwealth towards meeting its objectives to increase access to higher education as set out in A Fair Chance for All.</PARA>
