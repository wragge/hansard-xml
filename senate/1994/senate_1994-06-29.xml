<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the ATSIC (Misbehaviour) Determination No 1 under s.4A of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 5 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of paragraph 3(1), which determine misbehaviour for the purposes of the Act, include several expressions which are imprecise and which require subjective judgments. Illustrations are "seriously disruptive" behaviour; "misleading information" and "behaviour of a member of an Aboriginal body in the capacity of member of that body that brings the body, or another Aboriginal body, into public disrepute". The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether these expressions are appropriate, given that misbehaviour may result in officers or elected representatives being suspended from office or having their appointments terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, paragraphs 3(1)(j) and 3(2) provide that conviction of an offence punishable by imprisonment is taken to be misbehaviour for the purposes of the Act. The Determination then provides that a person is taken to have been convicted of an offence if, among other things, the person has been charged with and found guilty of an offence, but discharged without conviction, or the person has not been found guilty of an offence, but a court has taken the offence into account in passing sentence on the person for another offence. Under these provisions persons are deemed to have been convicted of matters for which the court decided they should not be convicted or for which they have not even been found guilty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that these provisions may operate harshly and breach the personal rights of those affected. The Committee accepts that the provisions are based on the existing s.85ZM of the Crimes Act 1914. In that Act, however, the provisions are not used to penalise anyone, as is the case in the present Determination. Indeed, s.85ZM expressly applies only to the Part of that Act dealing with "Pardons, Quashed Convictions and Spent Convictions". That is a different concept from the present one, in which people are not being considered for a pardon or the quashing of a widely defined conviction, but are having non-convictions included in assessments relating to current decisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 6 May 1994 regarding ATSIC (Misbehaviour) Determination No. 1 under section 4A of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (`the ATSIC Act') which was considered by your Committee at its meeting of 5 May 1994. I have noted the Committee's comments on the Determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing with the particular issues which the Committee raises I make the following general comments on the Determination:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it was drafted in the light of the decision of the Commission as to the matters which the Commission wished to include; some of these matters were subsumed in the expressions used;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in drafting the Determination the possible serious consequences of a breach were taken into account and the expressions used were as precise as the subject matter permitted; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">no action would be taken by me to suspend or terminate the appointment of a Commissioner (section 40 of the ATSIC Act), terminate (with the agreement of the Commission) the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer (section 53 of the ATSIC Act), a Regional Councillor (section 122A of the ATSIC Act), or suspend or remove from office a Chairperson of a Regional Council (section 127C of the ATSIC Act), without my satisfying myself that misbehaviour (if relevant) had been fully established and, of course, my decision would be subject to all the usual means of administrative review. Sections 40, 122A and 127C contain provisions for parliamentary review before effect could be given to a decision to terminate an appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to sub paragraph 3(1) of the Determination you express concern that several expressions used are `imprecise' and `require subjective judgments'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the specific matters you raise in paragraph 2 of your letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the expression `seriously disruptive' in subparagraph 3(1)(a)(i) of the Determination is to be read in the light of subparagraph 3(1)(a)(ii) which makes it clear that, to constitute misbehaviour, such disruption must have continued after the person presiding at the meeting concerned had requested the disrupting person to refrain from the disruption. In my view this provides a factual requirement which should obviate subjective judgment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`misleading information' is a phrase which should be read in the context of subparagraph 3(1)(c) and the meaning given to the phrase is qualified by the purpose stated in that subparagraph ie the information must have been provided `for the purposes of', or result in, the payment of remuneration or allowances. To give misleading information for the purpose stated appears to me to be serious and the phrase, in context, appears capable of objective application; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`behaviour' which brings an Aboriginal body `into public disrepute' is a catch all expression; to specify all types of behaviour which could have such an effect would not be feasible, particularly as behaviour which might be acceptable in some situations would not be acceptable in other situations. The phrase is frequently used in a similar context in constitutions of clubs and associations and it should be possible to apply this subparagraph objectively in the light of the circumstances of any particular case which arises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In paragraph 3 of your letter you refer to the provisions of subparagraph 3(1)(j) and subsection 3(2). As you point out, the provisions in subsection 3(2) mirror the provisions in subparagraphs 85 ZM(a), (b) and (c) of the Crimes Act 1914. While section 85 ZM is in a Part dealing with `Pardons, Quashed Convictions and Spent Convictions' it would seem to me appropriate to regard conviction of an offence (Determination 3(2)(a)) and a finding of guilt in relation to an offence, without conviction (Determination 3(2)(b)), as grounds for suspension whatever the legislative source of the wording of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 16BA of the Crimes Act (copy attached) makes provision for a person `convicted of a federal offence or offences' to admit guilt in respect of other alleged offences with the consequences that, while the offence concerned is taken into account in sentencing, it may not subsequently be the subject of fresh proceedings. The circumstances in which a court would take such an unproven offence into account appear to make it appropriate that such an offence should also be relevant in considering whether misbehaviour has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have in mind that the Commission has significant administrative responsibilities including the making of grants, loans and guarantees out of a considerable appropriation from the Parliament. From 1 July 1994 Regional Councils will also have such responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such responsibilities require considerable accountability. I am sure you will agree that striking a balance between public accountability on the one hand and personal rights on the other is a difficult matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 May 1994 on aspects raised by the Committee of the ATSIC (Misbehaviour) Determination No.1 under s.4A of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The Committee considered the letter at its meeting of 2 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the advice, which meets all its concerns with the exception of the provisions of paragraphs 3(2)(b) and (c). In this context, the Committee emphasises that s.85ZM of the Crimes Act 1914 operates to the benefit of individuals, as does s.16BA of the same Act. The Committee believes that it is inappropriate for the present Determination to use similar provisions to prejudice individuals and that it would strengthen personal rights if you gave an undertaking to delete paragraphs 3(2)(b) and (c).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 May 1994, I gave a protective notice of disallowance of the Determination for 15 sitting days after that date. In view of this it would be appreciated if the Committee could receive an early reply to this letter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 2 June 1994, in relation to ATSIC (Misbehaviour) Determination No. 1 (`the Determination').</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have indicated that the only provisions of the Determination which cause your Committee continuing concern are the provisions of sub-paragraphs 3(2)(b) and (c).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions were inserted to give effect to one of the recommendations of the Commission at its Board Meeting on 26-29 November, 1 December 1993 in relation to action and/or conduct which it regarded as misbehaviour. The recommendation concerned referred to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`conduct leading to a sentence or a fine for an offence involving dishonesty where a conviction is not recorded . . . '</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of your Committee's objection, I am prepared to delete subparagraph 3(2)(c) from the Determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to subparagraph 3(2)(b) I point out that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the words `the offence` in that subparagraph refer to an offence as defined in subparagraph 3(1)(j) of the Determination ie `an offence (for which a person may, on conviction, be imprisoned)';</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">such an offence is clearly likely to be an offence sufficiently serious to justify my considering suspension from an office in ATSIC or a Regional Council of the person concerned even if a Court, presumably on the basis of mitigating circumstances, discharges such an offender without recording a conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out on page 3 of my letter of 27 May 1994 the Commission and Regional Councils (after 1 July 1994) have significant administrative responsibilities involving the disbursement of a considerable appropriation from the Parliament and the Commission is entitled, I believe, to expect that Commissioners, Commission officers, and Regional councillors be persons of integrity and probity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discretion vested in me in such matters (to which I referred in my letter of 27 May 1994) would enable me to approach each case on its merits and, in particular, to take into account any reasons given by a Court for not recording a conviction if relevant to the person's fitness for office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances I cannot see any likelihood of subparagraph 3(2)(b) operating `to prejudice individuals' and request that your Committee reconsider its objection to the subparagraph.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In amending the Determination it may be necessary to make a formal amendment to sub-paragraph 3(1)(j) to make it clear that the word `offence' includes convictions for more than one offence and also includes a conviction or convictions resulting in a single sentence imposed for more than one offence. I trust that such an amendment would not cause any concern to your Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to require parliamentary approval of treaties which the Government proposes should apply to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrat's reason for introducing this bill is to make the Government more accountable in its conduct of our international relations. Global interdependence is growing rapidly, and it is a strange anachronism that Parliament has no say over the signing of treaties which can be of momentous significance to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedure by which Parliament now considers treaties is nothing short of farcical. Once a year, a huge number of agreements is tabled, and a few Senators make brief comments on a handful of them. No vote is taken, because Parliament's opinion is irrelevant. That is the pitiful extent to which Australia's democratically elected representatives have a say in treaty-making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a few cases, some of the provisions of a treaty require domestic legislation. This can produce some debate about the treaty's merits, and Parliament can prevent at least those provisions from being given the force of domestic law. But this is an incidental and marginal form of accountability, and is clearly unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats' belief that treaties should be approved by Parliament goes back to the mid-1980s. The nuclear debate had revealed that Australian governments had signed agreements which made Australia a nuclear target, and a potential contributor to nuclear weapons proliferation, without the need for Parliament's approval or even knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History repeated itself in 1988, when the Hawke Government signed new ten-year agreements covering the US/Australian facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Because the agreements were made the subject of a prime ministerial statement, a parliamentary debate did occur&mdash;but the agreements were a fait accompli, and the debate a mere formality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats note with interest that the Opposition has begun to call for Parliament to be given a greater role. On the 8th of June this year, Opposition Leader Alexander Downer told the National Press Club that the Australian Parliament should have a "proper say" in our international treaty-making processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here is the Opposition's opportunity to demonstrate its sincerity in demanding greater accountability in treaty-making. A bill which does indeed give Parliament a proper say.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should make one thing clear. This is not a Fortress Australia bill. It is not an attempt to disengage from the world community, to play King Canute by ordering away the rising tide of international interdependence. That is neither possible nor desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the contrary, this bill is designed to better engage Australia with the world. As the web of agreements binding nations together grows stronger and more complex, it is untenable that Parliament's agenda continues to look as though the rest of the world barely exists. We argue over the detail of domestic legislation which is often far less significant than treaties which barely make a dent on our collective consciousness. For example, debate in this place about the completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been minimal and shallow, despite the enormous impact it is predicted to have on our national economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longer this state of affairs continues, the more irrelevant this Parliament will become. Many of our number will continue to regard treaty-making as an intrinsically suspect activity conducted by shadowy figures in far-off places. The purpose of this bill is to make Parliament a part of the treaty-making process. The result should be a more mature and informed debate about international matters. Attempts to beat up voter concern about international influence over our domestic affairs would become much more difficult to sustain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill should be attractive to both the Government and the Opposition. For the Government, it holds the promise of a better domestic understanding of international affairs, and a more mature debate. For the Opposition, it provides for greater executive accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions have been raised as to whether Parliament has the constitutional power to require by legislation that treaties be submitted to it for approval. We have sought advice from Mr Tony Morris QC on this point, and he has no doubt that Parliament does have that power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been drafted to provide a simple and effective mechanism for approving treaties which does not make unwanted demands on Parliament's time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the model we have chosen, either House of Parliament would debate a treaty if, within 15 sitting days of it being tabled, a member of that House gives notice of motion that the treaty be considered. If no notice of motion is given, the House is deemed to have approved the treaty after 15 sitting days have elapsed. If notice is given, then the treaty must be considered within 15 sitting days, with approval requiring the assent of the House. Both Houses must have approved the treaty by one of these two methods before it can enter into force in respect of Australia. If either House votes against the treaty, it cannot enter into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This procedure ensures that Parliament does not spend unnecessary time debating inconsequential or uncontroversial treaties. However it also avoids the inherent negativity of a disallowance procedure. It is a genuine approval process which allows Parliament to concentrate on those agreements which are significant or controversial&mdash;not just those which  are controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A notice of motion for approval of a treaty may be withdrawn, at one sitting day's notice, by the member who gave it. If fifteen sitting days have not yet elapsed since the treaty was tabled, any member can give a new notice of motion to approve the same treaty. Alternatively, any other member can take over the notice of motion whether or not fifteen sitting days have expired. This is based on the disallowance procedures of the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acts Interpretation Act also provides the model for what happens to an approval motion when the House of Representatives is dissolved or expired, or the Parliament is prorogued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If fifteen sitting days has not elapsed since tabling of the treaty, and there is no current notice of motion for approval, then notice can be given in the new Parliament within the remaining available sitting days. If there is a notice of motion which has not been withdrawn, or called on, or not otherwise disposed of, then the treaty is deemed to be tabled in the relevant House on its first day back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important provision of this bill is that any reservation to a treaty proposed by the Government also requires parliamentary approval, by exactly the same procedure as applies to treaties. Reservations have an obvious impact on the operation of a treaty in respect of Australia, and should be subjected to the same oversight as the treaty itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to record my thanks to the Clerk of the Senate, and to Mr Tony Morris QC, for their assistance in drafting this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would conclude by saying that this bill, if passed into law, would achieve two things: it would provide greater government accountability, and would maintain Parliament's relevance in the international age. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report discusses a matter of significant importance to the community, namely the growing influx of overseas sourced audiotex services of an adult nature which do not adhere to Australia's codes of practice for such services. The report also addresses developments with the committee's inquiry into the classification of video and computer games and progress to date on the committee inquiry into whether R-rated material should be available on pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception in 1991 the committee has been asked by the Senate to examine the suitability of commercial recorded information and entertainment services utilising telecommunications technologies. Having examined the problems of the 0055 recorded message industry in Australia and, with the cooperation of Telecom and most of the industry participants, having largely overcome the problem of access by minors to unsuitable material, the committee was disturbed to learn in mid-1993 that explicit adult audiotex material was being made available in Australia from overseas sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report describes the results of the committee's discussions with the major players in the telecommunications industry, including Telstra, Optus, the Australian Telecommunications Authority and the then Department of Transport and Communications in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is evidence that prompt action by Telstra and Optus has reduced the amount of the more unacceptable elements of this international telephone material, the committee is concerned that the Australian government has not to date made a more positive contribution to resolving the problem. Part of that process of resolution should involve the negotiation at the multilateral level of an international code of practice containing content standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee, while commending the unilateral and bilateral efforts of the carriers, which in many respects are against their own commercial interests, has recommended that the government should assist their efforts overseas. Most importantly though, the committee has recommended that the government should take a leading role in multilateral negotiations to establish an internationally accepted code of practice for audiotex services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also deals with developments on the issue of the classification of video and computer games. Senators would be aware that the committee had tabled a report in October 1993 which, among other recommendations, called for R- and X-rated video and computer games to be banned. I am pleased to note that, after some early indications that certain state and territory governments did not favour this course, the committee's recommendation on R and X material has now been adopted by all Australian governments and a uniform national regulatory regime will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also noted a continuing community debate about the harmful effects of video and computer games in general, concentrating on their addictive and solitary nature. The committee considers, however, that these apparently negative characteristics could be used as a creative force if children were exposed to a greater choice of beneficial and constructive material. The committee has therefore recommended that the government examine ways in which it can encourage the industry to develop and give emphasis to more positive educational and entertainment games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the committee's current inquiry into whether R-rated material should be permitted on pay TV are also described in the report.

<PARA>The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is particularly pleased to present this report, which describes action by the committee to remedy serious breaches of the personal rights of Australian children, their parents and guardians. These breaches related to recent amendments of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations. Those regulations implement the child abduction convention, which provides important safeguards for the rights of children, including the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in a country which is a party to the convention, and reciprocal rights of custody and access to children under the laws of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a party to the convention since 1 January 1987, after regulations established a legal framework and administrative arrangements. Later, regulations prescribed the then Yugoslavia as a convention country with effect from 1 December 1991. Then, earlier this year, following developments in that troubled area, the regulations removed the existing reference to Yugoslavia as a country in respect of which the convention had entered into force for Australia and substituted references to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The result was that considerable areas of the former Yugoslavia were no longer covered by the convention. These areas included the present Serbia, Slovenia and Montenegro, from which the regulations effectively removed the protection of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a matter of considerable concern to the committee, which contacted the Attorney-General, the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 October 1992, the Senate referred to the transport, communications and infrastructure committee for inquiry and report the following matter: the capacity of public sector authorities to plan for, forecast and respond to major disasters and large-scale emergencies, fully respecting and utilising the skills and capabilities of volunteer organisations. At the commencement of the 37th Parliament in May 1993 the industry, science and technology committee was amalgamated with the transport, communications and infrastructure committee. After the merger the new committee agreed to continue the reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that is before the Senate is a unanimous report and its findings have the strong support of all members of the committee. The inquiry considered the role the Commonwealth government plays in disaster management and the functions and activities of its central disaster management organisation, Emergency Management Australia. EMA's role in responding to a disaster is one of coordination of state or territory requests, assessment of those requests and, when necessary, arranging for the deployment of Commonwealth resources. EMA performs this function efficiently and there is widespread support of EMA from the emergency management community in the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee believes that EMA has been too response oriented. The report outlines the need for a change in emphasis by EMA in order to provide a more comprehensive and integrated approach to emergency management. The report emphasises the need for EMA to refocus its role to provide leadership and support to the states and territories in the other critical areas of emergency management preparedness planning, prevention, mitigation, training and recovery. The committee makes a number of recommendations to allow this to happen. Creating EMA as an independent body and moving it from the Defence portfolio to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is a key recommendation. EMA must be given the independence and the means to allow it to set standards in training, support, information gathering and distribution, as well as coordinating the Commonwealth's response to disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for a more coordinated approach to disaster management between the Commonwealth and the states, between states and within the states themselves was clearly evident during the recent disastrous bushfires in NSW and Western Australia. In Sydney last January, there were many generous offers of assistance but there were also many problems associated with delivery of that assistance. Among the more serious problems were a lack of compatibility of communication frequencies and of basic equipment such as hose couplings on fire trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee strongly supports the retention of EMA's training institute at Mount Macedon and recommends that it be developed as a centre of excellence in emergency management. Properly developed, the institute should provide the resources and training needed by the states and territories which will result in a more integrated approach to emergency management. From the Commonwealth's perspective this is a critical activity for which EMA must take responsibility. The need for increased levels of training was emphasised throughout the committee's inquiry, particularly in the fields of bushfire suppression and chemical spills. The committee recommends in the report that EMA use the United Nation's International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to showcase the benefits of preparedness/mitigation by more actively seeking out projects and assisting their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to EMA, the Commonwealth provides assistance in emergency management through a number of other agencies: the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Maritime Safety Authority and the Exotic Animal Diseases Preparedness Consultative Council, among others. While these agencies each make a significant contribution in their own fields of emergency management, there is insufficient coordination between agencies. The committee therefore recommends that the Commonwealth Counter Disaster Task Force coordinate forward planning of Australian government disaster relief systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes over 40 other recommendations on specific aspects of disaster management, through the phases of preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as recommendations relating to the specific role the Commonwealth has in its own zones of responsibility such as the Great Barrier Reef and armed services land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As directed by the inquiry's terms of reference, the report also considers the role of volunteers in emergency management and concludes that volunteers have a fundamental and indispensable role to play in disaster management, which is often overlooked by governments. Australia has a proud history of responding generously to communities affected by disaster. The response of people giving of their time and money has again and again eased the plight of those directly affected. The recent Sydney bushfires and the response of the community across Australia shows this clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has nothing but praise for the efforts of volunteers and professionals alike who respond in these circumstances. However, the committee found that a more comprehensive and integrated approach to emergency management planning would significantly reduce the effect of some types of disaster, for example bushfires, and in other situations would ensure that recovery took place faster and with less traumatic effect. This would certainly have been the case in Newcastle following the earthquake in 1989, where many critical decisions had to be taken for which there was no planning and no response framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the committee, EMA indicated that it was changing its focus to address emergency management in a more comprehensive and integrated way. The committee believes that EMA should provide greater leadership in this way and, through its institute at Mount Macedon, establish a centre of excellence in emergency management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as praising the community volunteers and professionals for the efforts that they put into responding to disasters, I wish to pass on the praise the committee heard for the support of other agencies at the Commonwealth level. These include the Bureau of Meteorology, Telecom, the Department of Social Security and defence support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to thank my colleagues on the committee. We have visited many of the disaster prone areas of Australia and reviewed the mass of evidence obtained. Of course, I would also like to thank very much Rob Diamond, the secretary of the committee, and the other officers in the secretariat. The committee's recommendations will do much to improve emergency management arrangements at the Commonwealth level and, as a consequence, should result in better preparedness and support in the event of a disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last August, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I called upon the committee to include within its inquiry into natural disasters an examination of the impact of the then disastrous mouse plague upon the rural communities in South Australia and Victoria in particular. As a result of that, the committee agreed to extend its terms of reference to include that matter within the inquiry, and I certainly welcome the decision of my colleagues on the committee to do that. As a result, this issue was explored at length by the committee, and I am pleased that the findings that are tabled today in this first-class report have vindicated my stand in calling for more to be done for farmers who encounter mouse plagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of this committee's inquiry contains a range of very important findings and commendable recommendations to which the chairman, Senator Childs, has just drawn attention. Those findings and recommendations cover the range of bushfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters which impinge on our Australian community. Without diminishing the importance of those recommendations&mdash;each and every one of them is of great importance&mdash;I wish to direct particular attention to the recommendations regarding mouse plagues because of the interest that I took in that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I welcome the recommendations that the committee has made with regard to the handling of mouse plagues and I particularly welcome the fact that these recommendations come on a bipartisan basis, despite a decided lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, for my suggested initiatives. In answer to questions which I asked in this place earlier this year, he to some extent treated the plight of those in the rural community suffering from the mouse plague with what I regarded as an unacceptable degree of levity. At least today the joke is on Senator Collins because we now have a bipartisan report which shows that the government, and certainly the minister, have not treated this issue with the serious attention that it deserves. If the minister had bothered to use the experience he claims to have gained while working with CSIRO at its research laboratories in Darwin, he may not be so embarrassed by this report today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence in the report, which was given to us during our inquiries, highlights that it is estimated that more than $100 million was lost by grain growers alone as a direct result of the mouse plague in South Australia and Victoria last year. We, as members of the committee, heard compelling evidence from several witnesses that mice were in such large numbers at the time that the problems spread to other industry sectors, including pig and poultry farms, and affected people in rural communities beyond the farms&mdash;indeed, in country towns as well. I recall one witness telling us that farmers even found mice in the fleece of their sheep, such was the degree of the problem and the infestation of mice that occurred at that time. The old saying that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure is indicative of the problems currently facing our rural communities, as is highlighted in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the committee clearly demonstrate that the government as yet has done little on a national scale to assist the control of the outbreak of mice. At the time of last year's outbreak there was no identified group adequately equipped to deal with the problem. It was further revealed that since the last outbreak occurred some years ago, information about past practices and control methods had been lost or destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 February this year the minister responded to my questions on this issue by making the admission that the CSIRO had, in fact, forecast last year's plague but that the extent of the outbreak was much more serious than anticipated. At that time he went on to reject any move to establish a rodent plague commission, saying that he had considerable doubt that it would result in the death of one additional mouse. This remarkable attitude by the minister is in stark contrast with the committee's findings that more effective preventative and control methods can and must be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, as I said earlier, has been derelict in its duties to coordinate at a national level proper control methods. Had the minister taken the matter more seriously instead of, at the time I first raised it with him earlier this year, treating it as a laughing matter, farmers in South Australia and Victoria may have been spared the devastation that they encountered last year. I do not want to focus entirely upon the failures of the minister with regard to this matter because the findings of this Senate inquiry present many positive aspects which deserve due attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee determined that mice plagues be included under the natural disaster relief arrangements, the NDRA, to award maximum financial assistance to farmers through the programs administered under the NDRA. This recommendation will lift an enormous burden financially from farmers who encounter future mouse plagues, as many are still recovering from the rural recession. Any move to help our rural communities has my strongest endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further recommendation is the establishment of a rodent or mice plague commission to coordinate and facilitate cooperation between states, particularly where plagues cross state boundaries, as was the experience last year. The committee has determined that such a commission would provide a national focus, be independent, report to state agriculture ministers, be funded centrally, keep farmers regularly informed and work with the Grains Research and Development Corporation to raise research funds. Such a commission would be useful in conducting research on mouse population factors and would provide farmers with valuable preventative measures. The committee has also found that there is a need for a clear policy at the federal level on the availability and use of strychnine poisons currently used by farmers to deal with mice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before in this place, it is strange that, after more than a century of mouse plagues in this country and with all the scientific advances that we have at our disposal, we are still reliant upon the rodenticide strychnine as the only effective method of rodent control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I am confident that the findings and recommendations of this committee's report will be welcomed within the rural community. But the problem standing in the way of putting the committee's recommendation into effect will be the attitude of the minister, if it persists. I therefore ask that the minister take due notice of this bipartisan report and its recommendations and, as someone who professes to have a background in scientific research, as the minister does, I ask him to take account of this report, look at the evidence that has been presented to the committee, look at the recommendations of the committee, and take action to implement the report's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I strongly urge the government to accept the committee's findings and, for once, to give our farmers a fighting chance against any mouse plague that might eventuate in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, like the chairman, I would like to thank the secretariat. Without its role in the course of these inquiries, the inquiries would not have been held; and I do not think that we would have a report. So I thank Rob and all the other staff very much. I would also like to thank the other members of the committee, because we ended up with a report that everybody pretty well agreed with. Also, I think it is important to note the contributions that we have received through submissions. Many of them have given us an invaluable insight into the circumstances confronting various types of disasters that have been experienced. I think that role quite often goes unnoticed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, it was a great experience to be able to travel around the country and look at some of the effects that have occurred, either as a result of disasters in the past, or in terms of fires that have occurred more recently. It is the question of fires that I would like to deal with. I know that Senator Coulter wants to deal with this same issue, in so far as it relates to aerial suppression. Briefly, I want to say that I found it amazing that&mdash;and I still cannot understand why&mdash;there is such great resistance in this country and within the firefighting organisations of this country to aerial suppression, in particular aerial suppression by fixed-wing aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the opportunity very late in the course of this inquiry to get some information. I know that whilst the information has been around for many years, and I understand that Senator Coulter has been pursuing such matters for a long time, being able to see the types of fixed-wing aircraft that are available and the capacity that they have to deal with not only bushfires but also industrial fires would have to leave anyone with any degree of commonsense amazed at the fact that we do not have them in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman was talking about not spending a dollar to save a million. In this case the aircraft are quite expensive. But if we look at the cost of some of the fires that we have had in this country in very recent times, in many cases that cost would be immeasurable in environmental terms. In terms of lost forest, houses, farmland and so on, what would be the cost of the planes versus the cost of the overall fire? It is just inconceivable that we would be in a position where we would not seek to use&mdash;or have and use&mdash;the types of aerial fire suppression available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to fires like that on Coode Island and other major industrial fires, what has been clearly demonstrated in other parts of the world is the capacity of these planes&mdash;which I will leave for Senator Coulter to give a greater explanation about&mdash;to provide a very efficient suppressant of fire, whether an industrial fire or indeed a bushfire. It leaves me amazed that there has been such great resistance to them in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government in conjunction with the state governments trial at least four of the CL215 aircraft for water bombing on a shared cost basis and that other uses for these aircraft be fully explored. I think that that is one of the most important recommendations in this report. I urge everybody within this chamber&mdash;and of course I will be urging the federal government&mdash;to make sure that this particular recommendation is taken up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy for those introductory remarks because, yes, I certainly will want to deal with that part of the report which is covered on pages 91 to 93 and deals with the aerial suppression of fires. Very briefly I want to reiterate something that I put in an adjournment speech a few weeks ago in relation to Project Aquarius, a computer based study carried out in the early 1980s into the aerial suppression of fires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the results which came from that computer based study, into which a number of quite false assumptions were fed&mdash;and that helps to explain it very substantially&mdash;over the succeeding years, the various bushfire fighting organisations around this country have tended to ignore the very important role which the Canadair CL215 and the updated version, the Canadair CL415, could have played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reiterate a few of the factors which were fed into the computer based study, Project Aquarius. As I said several weeks ago, Project Aquarius carried out no practical tests whatsoever on this aircraft. Project Aquarius fed into its study a height for water dropping of 200 metres. When I visited the Greek operation which uses a large number of CL215 aircraft for aerial suppression of fires, every man who flew those aircraft simply burst out laughing and pointed out that they come in at tree top height, roughly about 30 to 50 feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the committee saw some video footage of the use of this aircraft in a fire in California&mdash;the Laurel Canyon fire&mdash;where in fact these aircraft were coming in and brushing the tree tops. That is a very significant factor to feed into these sorts of studies because it is important that the water be got down to the forest floor. Project Aquarius also regarded this aircraft as one which would necessarily have to pick up from bodies of fresh water and pointed out that fresh water was a scarce commodity in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this aircraft picks up six tonnes of water in 10 seconds, it scoops while it is in flight, and it picks up very successfully from the ocean. It can land in oceans with seas up to two metres in height. By 1992 this aircraft had passed its one millionth drop of sea water. In the case of the New South Wales fires, evidence was given to the committee that practically all those fires were within five minutes flying time of water, particularly the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw special attention to the Royal National Park fire which of course was right on the seafront. Again, while Project Aquarius talked about one or two drops an hour, this aircraft has achieved up to 31 and 32 water drops an hour when the water is close to the source of the fire. This aircraft, of which I have a model here, is a completely amphibious aircraft. It can land on land or in the ocean. It can trundle out of the water onto land&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> has had difficulty incorporating other things in the past; I think it might have some difficulty incorporating that. The fact is that this aircraft has been very effective, not only in Canada but also right across southern Europe. It is used in this capacity in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and also former Yugoslavia. There is no doubt that this aircraft has played a very significant part in other parts of the world in suppressing bushfires. The committee clearly has no doubt that it would be very worth while to test this aircraft under actual practical conditions in Australia. I am very pleased that the committee has made that recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was aware of the fact that this aircraft is expensive&mdash;each aircraft costs roughly $25 million. The answer to that problem is to multi-task the aircraft&mdash;to use it in a range of other capacities. It would be extremely useful for northern surveillance, sea rescue, oil spills at sea, servicing lights and buoys at sea, and a range of similar tasks. In the event of war it can carry a fully armed platoon of soldiers into remote areas, land on the water and take the soldiers up onto a beach. In fact, Indonesia is using the aircraft in that particular military capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which Australia could address the problem of the high cost of the aircraft would be to multi-task them. My personal recommendation to government would be to put them under an organisation such as the Fleet Air Arm that is similar to the Greek operation and then make them available to the various services as they are needed&mdash;whether it is the quarantine service, the immigration service, the fishery service or rescue in remote areas of the ocean of people who are in difficulties in the sea. All those individual services could then call on the Fleet Air Arm to make this aircraft available. That is the way in which the aircraft's costs for firefighting could be kept down. The committee has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with state governments trial at least 4 CL-215 water bombing aircraft on a shared cost basis, and that other uses for these aircraft be fully explored.</PARA>
<PARA>Very late in the taking of evidence the committee received a letter from Bombadier Inc. in Canada offering to fly these aircraft from Canada during the next northern winter, our summer, make them available from 1 December 1994 to 31 March&mdash;that is, right through our bushfire season&mdash;for $1 million per aircraft, fully crew them with both ground and aircrews and include 350 hours of flying time in Australia which should be more than an adequate number of hours to fully test these aircraft under operational conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the committee drafted its report, I have heard from an organisation called the Australian Aero Medical Services Association. I will be meeting with its chief executive officer tomorrow. That organisation, which is centred in Sydney, plans to launch a fundraising campaign in Australia beginning on 1 August to raise $2 million for just this purpose&mdash;in other words, to subsidise dollar for dollar that recommendation of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I very strongly press the government to accept this recommendation in the light of the fact that other sources of funding are likely to be available, and therefore give Australians an opportunity not only to look at these aircraft from the point of view of bushfire fighting but also to test the full range of their capabilities. I think it is terribly important that the government, as Senator Murphy has said, look very seriously at this recommendation and accept it. I believe that in the long run this aircraft will add very significantly to our ability to deal with those disastrous bushfires which visit Australia essentially every eight to 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I took part in this inquiry, which I believe was a very worthwhile exercise. I will try not to go over what has already been said, but I took particular interest in various phases of the inquiry. The main area that I was interested in was bushfires, and we looked at that right at the end of our inquiry. It might have even been New Year's Day&mdash;I am not quite sure when it was&mdash;when I rang Senator Childs and asked whether we could take that in at the end of the inquiry. I thank him for his quick action so that we could take part in that. In Western Australia we had a major bushfire in remote areas virtually at the same time as the New South Wales fires. I took an interest in the bushfire situation in New South Wales and Western Australia as well as visited Victoria to learn about its history of bushfires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took a big interest, because of my grain growing interest, in the mice plague in South Australia. I certainly was impressed&mdash;perhaps that is not the right word as it was a major disaster&mdash;to see what can happen to a crop just simply by mice. I am used to other disasters involving crops&mdash;say, lack of rain, too much rain, hailstorms, windstorms and that sort of thing&mdash;but I have never seen such a disaster in a crop as that caused by vermin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been mentioned that we visited the Pilbara iron ore areas at Port Hedland. We visited those areas to look at problems associated with the shipping of iron ore in those big 150,000-tonne carriers, especially if the crews have a cyclone on their hands. Those cyclones have caused a few iron ore ships to sink in the Indian Ocean, some of them unfortunately without trace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also visited Newcastle&mdash;I did not go&mdash;to find out about the earthquake which occurred there. I had experience, not at first hand but at second hand, of the earthquake disaster in Meka in Western Australia in 1968. The committee also looked at exotic diseases. We visited Darwin and had representations from people there about, amongst other things, the problems that could be caused by nuclear ships coming into Australia, especially into the Darwin port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said, my main interest was in the bushfires. I was very happy to be part of the visit to the area affected by the New South Wales bushfires to find out about that disaster. Unfortunately, there was also some loss of life in those bushfires. I said this at the time and I will say it again that, although the bushfires were assisted by the weather conditions, things could have been far better if there had been controlled burning of those mountains and areas that were burnt out. There should have been controlled burning, as has been in place in Western Australia since at least 1961 when we had the major bushfires around Dwellingup. In those Dwellingup fires a vast amount of damage was done but fortunately we got away without one loss of life. To put those fires into perspective, they burned out at least 160 kilometres by about 120 kilometres and about three or four towns. As I said, fortunately there was no loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lessons we learn do tend to fade away when we do not have something to remind us of what can happen. Even in the state of Western Australia environmental groups, aided and abetted by the Greens (WA), are now trying to do away with controlled burning because of what they say it does to the environment. Though I am a believer in protecting the environment, I believe that human life comes first. Something I certainly do not want to see is any lessening of that controlled burning which reduces the fuel on the forest floor. I do believe that, if that practice had been in place in New South Wales, we would not have had anywhere near the disaster that took lives there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recommended that all states of Australia look at fuel reduction on the ground. I hope all states will carry out that recommendation and that those states that already operate in this way will continue to do so. The bushfires that hit Western Australia occurred in a remote area called Forrestania. In the past such an area would have been allowed to burn out on its own and nobody would have worried too much about it, but in these days there is a vast mining industry operating in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although very little was done about the fire early on, a lot of action was taken to eliminate problems as the days went on. Fortunately, there was no loss of life and no real threat to life resulting from those fires, but a power line had been installed at a cost of $18 million in a place called Kondinin. That ran to the Bounty mine at Forrestania and then went down to a nickel mine. That 132kV line had steel poles and there was a maximum clearance of some five metres, with the steel cable running down the middle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an extension from the Bounty mine down to the Forrestania nickel mine and, to my knowledge, that is a 66kV line strung between wooden poles. Believe it or not, there was no clearance track there at all because of the actions of CALM and the Environment Protection Authority of Western Australia. The boring machine just backed off the road, put in the poles and that was it, with no clearance track. That line was rendered useless by one fire only three months after the line had opened. Unfortunately, the users of power in Western Australia will have to pick up the tab. There was insurance, but the damage on the line came just under the threshold, so that the consumers of Western Australia will have to carry that burden. I am a believer in protection of the environment but of course life comes first. Therefore, there must be a commonsense approach to these matters. I believe that it was stupid of the SEC to agree to the terms of the EPA to put up that line in such conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the same fire the area shire, CALM&mdash;conservation and land management&mdash;and the bushfire board did not know whose responsibility the fire was. Therefore, it was left to the volunteers of the shire of Yilgarn and the shire of Kondinin to put the fires out. I believe a lot of work must be done by the government of Western Australia to sort out this problem. If CALM wants to control land, as it does in Western Australia, it must do something about the management of fire control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment on the work of WICEN, which is the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network, an amateur radio group. That network works within the HF band and there is also CREST, the civil radio emergency network, which also does valuable backup work. I believe that, arising from the  recommendations of this report, the Australian bushfire and emergency authorities will have to look at standardising radio equipment and frequencies throughout Australia. Therefore, if firefighters are travelling from west to east or from east to west, they should be able to use the same radio frequencies so that they can communicate with each other. </PARA>

People in those areas do not often see members of Senate committees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight of the year was the second Public Works Committee Conference which was held here at Parliament House. Members of public works committees or their equivalent from the Parliaments of Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT, and the New South Wales Public Accounts Committee, because of its interest in the private funding of public infrastructure, as well as the Commonwealth, attended the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference addressed a variety of statutory and operational matters which are common to, or have significant ramifications on, inquiries involving the proposed expenditure of considerable public funds. Matters discussed at the conference included the use of consultants; the use of value management techniques to assess public works; follow-up procedures on works in progress; the private funding of infrastructure; and the impact of the untying of Commonwealth departments and agencies from a central government design and construction authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is planned to hold these conferences every year if the calendars of the various parliaments permit. The next conference will be held in Hobart later this year and we hope to see each state and territory represented&mdash;perhaps even Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of significant issues emerged during the year, and these are described in the report. They relate to the provision of earth leakage circuit breakers and smoke detectors in Defence Housing Authority dwellings; the provision of facilities in all Commonwealth buildings for people with disabilities to ensure that right of equal access is maintained; and energy conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee Act precludes the committee from meeting overseas, although the committee is required to inquire into and report on overseas works such as embassies and high commissions. This anomaly has caused problems. The committee is unable to inspect existing buildings and sites proposed and to hold informal discussions with local staff and officials responsible for the design and construction of what are, after all, buildings which in some way should reflect Australia. The committee therefore believes that the Public Works Committee Act should be amended to enable the committee or a sectional committee to undertake inspections overseas and for the resources to be available for it to do so. It is much more prudent and effective if local inspections and discussions are held before the committee inquiries as is the case with other projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, on behalf of the committee I would like to make special mention of a number of former committee members who retired from the committee, and the Parliament for that matter, during the report period.

I would like to thank them both for the contributions that they made to the committee and to the parliament. I should also mention the former vice-chairman, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and another former member, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) for their contributions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I make a special statement on the requirements for tabling of delegated legislation. The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides a number of mandatory procedural and other safeguards which ensure that the Senate exercises an appropriately effective supervision of delegated legislation made by the executive. These are that legislative instruments must be tabled in both houses within 15 sitting days of making, and are subject to disallowance up to 15 sitting days after a notice of a motion of disallowance which itself may be given up to 15 sitting days after tabling. In addition, if after 15 sitting days of a notice of a motion of disallowance the notice has not been called on or otherwise disposed of, the regulations in the notice are deemed to have been disallowed. There are special safeguards protecting the right of a house of parliament to disallow where the House of Representatives is dissolved or expires, or the parliament is prorogued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability of parliament to supervise delegated legislation is also protected by provisions under which delegated legislation must not be remade before it is tabled and must not be remade while subject to disallowance, while disallowed delegated legislation must not be remade without approval of the disallowing house. There are other safeguards in the act which directly protect the rights of the public. For instance, delegated legislation must be gazetted, prejudicial provisions must not operate retrospectively and there are limits on the material which may be incorporated. The consequences of breaches of these safeguards are suitably severe, offending instruments being either void in whole or part or ceasing to have effect at the end of a specified period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has delegated to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances the responsibility of scrutinising the non-policy aspects of each one of the 1,600 disallowable legislative instruments tabled each year to ensure compliance with the highest standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. In addition, individual senators often take action in respect of policy aspects of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To exercise this control over delegated legislation, however, the parliament&mdash;which in practice means the Senate&mdash;and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances must be adequately informed. In this context there is a duty on public servants to ensure that disallowable instruments are tabled within a time which allows adequate scrutiny. In this context, there are situations where it is unacceptable for tabling to be delayed until the end of the statutory period of 15 sitting days after making. The committee recently encountered such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case a declaration No. 2 of 1994, which extended an earlier declaration No. 1 of 1994 for 30 days from 6 March 1994, was made and gazetted on 4 March 1994. The declaration therefore ceased to have effect on 6 April 1994. The declaration was not tabled in either house, however, until the last day upon which it was possible to do so, on the 15th sitting day after making&mdash;30 May 1994&mdash;more than three weeks after it ceased to have effect and some three months after it was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This position was most unsatisfactory, as parliament had no opportunity to scrutinise the declaration until well after it ceased to have effect. Moreover, in this case the breach of parliamentary propriety was exacerbated because a further separate declaration then effectively extended the operation of the terms of declaration No. 2 of 1994 for a further five years. This later declaration was made on 6 April 1994 and tabled on 10 May 1994, some three weeks before the declaration which it replaced was tabled. Further, it seems probable that declaration No. 2 of 1994 would not have been tabled at all without a reminder from 'staff of the regulations and ordinances committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nature of declaration No. 2 of 1994, it should have been tabled on the first available sitting day after making, on 14 March 1994, which was 10 days after the declaration was made. It is noteworthy that it was found to be possible to arrange gazettal of the declaration, which is not even a statutory requirement under the enabling act, for the same day as making. It was, however, apparently not possible to arrange tabling, which is a statutory requirement and a necessary prerequisite for scrutiny, until almost three months after it was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been recent cases of failures by public officials to table even by the 15th sitting day. In one instance the Senate received from a department a disallowable instrument for tabling with a covering memorandum dated 3 June 1994. The instrument itself had been made on 17 November 1993 and was therefore required to be tabled 15 sitting days after that, on 17 December 1993. Failure to table by that date resulted in the instrument thereby ceasing to have effect. The instrument did not include an express commencement provision and therefore, under the Acts Interpretation Act, it commenced on gazettal. The committee understands that the instrument was not gazetted and therefore did not come into operation. Nevertheless, the instrument, which was not accompanied by an explanatory statement, appeared to be an important part of a major government program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is also unsatisfactory. The result was that the Senate was not able to scrutinise a significant legislative instrument which was apparently intended to enter into force. That it did not do so, because of failure to observe procedural requirements, was fortuitous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Episodes such as these reflect poorly on the administrative competence of departments and agencies. Ministers should instruct the agencies for which they are responsible to ensure that tabling requirements are met promptly and, in particular, that parliament is given every opportunity to scrutinise instruments in a meaningful way. Appropriate compliance with legislative requirements is a hallmark of the administrative effectiveness of an agency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I make a special statement on the Territory of Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance 1988. The Territory of Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance 1988 was made under the Christmas Island Act 1958 by the Governor-General on 22 September 1988 and</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>was scrutinised by the committee in the usual way. This scrutiny revealed a number of apparent defects which the minister undertook to remove by amending the ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these defects was lack of provision for parliamentary scrutiny and control of procedures under which the casino licence was to be granted. In the case of this particular ordinance, the committee accepted that it was necessary for the eventual grant of the licence to be tabled in both houses only, rather than to be subject to both tabling and possible disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that, as the establishment of a casino would have considerable commercial implications for a private sector organisation, it was considered sufficient for parliament to be informed about the grant of the licence but not have the licence subject to disallowance. On the other hand, the committee considered that parliament should be in ultimate control of the procedures leading to the grant. In a matter as important and sensitive as the grant of a casino licence in an area for which the Commonwealth government has responsibility, parliamentary supervision of the processes leading to the grant would be more likely to ensure that appropriate safeguards are initiated before a commercial agreement actually came into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee accepted the undertaking of the minister of 23 November 1988 to amend the ordinance to provide, among other changes to satisfy the committee, that no fewer than 12 procedural requirements should be subject to tabling and possible disallowance. These procedures included those leading to the grant or assignment of a casino licence, the lease of the casino or its associated resort hotel, agreements between the developer and the operator, certain contracts for the supply of goods and services to the casino, licences for employees, and exclusion of people from the casino. The minister's undertaking was implemented by the Casino Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1989, ordinance No. 8 of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the relevant disallowance provisions in all these cases were provided for directly by reference to the parent Christmas Island Act 1958, not by applying appropriate provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 or by making use of the regulation making power in the principal ordinance. The relevant provisions of the Christmas Island Act provide not only for disallowance of legislative instruments, but also for partial disallowance. This is an important safeguard which the committee has argued should be available for all delegated legislation. Unfortunately, the number of series of instruments in respect of which this option may be exercised is at present quite limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 November 1993 the parliamentary secretary, acting for the minister, granted a casino licence under section 53(1) of the ordinance. The instrument was tabled in the Senate on 18 November 1993. The instrument was neither numbered nor accompanied by an explanatory statement. As noted earlier, the grant of a licence under section 53(1) was subject to tabling but not disallowance. Under section 53(2), however, the licence must be in a form approved by the minister, with the actual form being subject to both tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was concerned at a number of aspects of the instrument. The committee accepted that the lack of numbering, although virtually all delegated legislation is numbered, was perhaps understandable as the legislation contemplated only one casino licence for Christmas Island, which was granted for 15 years. The lack of an explanatory statement, however, was an unfortunate defect, as it may have explained the chief concern of the committee. This was that the approved form of the licence had not been tabled as required by section 53(2). This was a disturbing aspect of the administration of the ordinance, as parliamentary scrutiny of the processes leading to the grant of a licence is an important safeguard, expressly included to meet the earlier concerns of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several explanations suggested themselves to the committee. The first was that the failure to table the form of the licence was simply a managerial oversight, which could possibly be cured by future tabling. The second was that, for some reason, tabling of the approved form had been deliberately delayed. The most likely explanation, however, appeared to be that the section 53(2) approval was implied in the section 53(1) grant. In this context, the committee's legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan AM, advised that the latter position would be both unusual and unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore wrote to the minister, noting that it had not seen a section 53(2) approval and asking whether one would be tabled, or whether the tabling of the section 53(1) instrument was intended to satisfy the requirements of section 53(2). If tabling the one non-disallowable instrument was also considered to be tabling the other disallowable instrument, the committee asked for urgent confirmation that the one-page tabled instrument was subject to disallowance. If this was not the case, the committee asked for advice on the precise text which was subject to disallowance. Also, if it was not intended to table a separate approved form, the committee asked the minister to arrange for suitably senior officers of the department to attend its next meeting to brief members on the procedural responsibilities imposed by the ordinance. Finally, the committee pointed out that express approvals of other forms had been tabled separately. For instance, approval of the form of an agreement under section 62(2) between Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd and Casinos Austria International Pty Ltd was tabled. That form correctly indicated that it was a section 62(2) disallowable instrument and not an approval of the agreement under section 62(1), which is subject to tabling but not disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reply to the committee's letter relied on written advice from the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and from the Attorney-General's Department. The advice was that the scheme envisaged by the ordinance was that an appropriate form for a casino licence would probably be approved by the minister under section 53(2) before a licence would be granted under section 53(1). In this case, however, a separate form was not approved. Instead, the parliamentary secretary impliedly approved the form of the licence and expressly granted the licence in the same document. The advice was that although the form of the licence was not blank but already filled in, this did not matter because under the ordinance there will normally only be a single licensee. The advice emphasised that the position may well be different if an approved form would be completed by or in respect of many individuals. In this case, however, it was likely that the form of the licence would be different for each consecutive licensee, reflecting the fact that the minister may have particular requirements for each licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department then advised that those parts of the one-page instrument tabled on 18 November 1993 which were part of the approved form were disallowable, while the rest, not part of the form, were not disallowable. Further, if the disallowable parts were actually disallowed, the licence would not thereby cease to be valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result was that a single, short, one-page document was tabled in the Senate, some of the text of which was disallowable while other text was not. The practicalities of the situation were complicated by the tabled grant of the casino licence consisting of six paragraphs, which were not numbered, each of which contained only one sentence. It appears that some individual words and phrases could be disallowed but not other words and phrases in the same sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee accepted the advice without insisting on the information it had requested in its letter to the minister about the precise text which was disallowable. Instead, it noted that the advice expressly confirmed that the procedures followed were probably not those envisaged when the Governor-General made the ordinance. It also noted the advice of its legal adviser that the present procedures were both unusual and unsatisfactory. The committee believes that future action under the ordinance should take the form that was originally intended and which was in fact used in respect of other aspects of the administration of the ordinance. To do otherwise, as occurred in this case, is to make a mockery of either primary or delegated legislation or both. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's amendments will mean that from 1 January 1995 the income test for family payment and the income test for underage jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance will be amended so that certain tax deductible expenses on rental property are included as income. This measure follows from a decision in the 1992 budget to add back to taxable income the value of certain employer provided fringe benefits for the purposes of applying the income tests for those same payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the income test for the family payment is based on taxable income as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Under the tax act, the benefits of negative gearing are allowed in assessing income for tax purposes. However, when taxable income is used for determining income for social security purposes, those people who have negatively geared benefit unfairly. The government amendments will mean that deductions used for negative gearing will be included as income for social security purposes. The amendments, if passed, will result in what we believe is a more equitable assessment of income for social security purposes and better targeting of government plans. The coalition will be supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>By way of background: following the government's security and retirement statement, the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, announced changes to the treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities under the social security income and assets test. Amendments to give effect to those changes were enacted by the parliament in division 19 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992, but the commencement was deferred to 1 October 1993 or the date of the superannuation committee's report on division 19 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date the superannuation committee has not reported to the Senate, but has produced an issues paper to which the minister responded by advising that the current income test treatment of allocated pensions would continue, and that in the meantime allocated pensions would be included in the assets test. The amendments proposed by the government, if implemented, will mean that division 19 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992 and its commencement provision will be repealed so that, in effect, there will be no change to the current income test treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities. </PARA>

This amendment is preferable to having annuities assessed for both the income and assets tests. However, when the government's amendments to this bill were circulated, the coalition became conscious of the element of retrospectivity. The opposition has circulated an amendment which aims to remove the retrospectivity from the government's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To make things simpler for Senator Crowley: we know when we are beaten and, from discussions outside the chamber, I realised that the Democrats would not support our amendment. I think that is outrageous because the implication here is legislation by announcement or by press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something we have always opposed and for which&mdash;I might stand to be corrected&mdash;we have had the support of the Democrats. I remember an occasion some time ago where there was a problem with the Taxation Act. It related to incentives in the way of prizes for people involved in selling programs&mdash;for example, people selling tupperware&mdash;for selling a certain amount of product. An announcement was made by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, that such prizes would be subject to taxation. At the time of that announcement people had already received prizes thinking that they would not attract tax. They suddenly found that their $3,000 trip overseas, or whatever, attracted tax. The government wanted this new provision to be effective from the date of its announcement. The coalition thought that was outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a reasonable government people should be able to assume that if something is l-a-w law&mdash;with this government that does not mean much; we only have to look at the promised tax breaks before the last election&mdash;what it is and the date from which it will operate will be made known publicly. That way people would have no excuse for not knowing what the law is. This government operates in such a way that it makes an announcement about proposed legislation but the legislation itself does not come into force for years. For that reason, people have to be aware of every government announcement. Not all people go to financial advisers&mdash;who would be expected to be on top of what the government is doing and the changes it is bringing in&mdash;but they are still supposed to know about decisions such as this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a good precedent to be saying that the legislation is not retrospective if the government has made an announcement about its introduction. The government could be making announcements all over the place and introducing the legislation years later with people being expected to act in accordance with the proposed legislation from the date of the announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we believe that this legislation should be effective from 1994 and not from the date of the announcement in 1992. While a starting date of 1992 is better than nothing, the Democrats are basing their decision to oppose our amendment on an incorrect premise. In the worst of all worlds we will accept their amendment. If it would make things easier to put our amendment first, have it defeated and then put the Democrats' amendment, I would be happy to do so if we could do it by leave. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are dealing with the holders of allocated pensions we are dealing with a group of people who have contributed substantially to the economic and social wellbeing of this country. We are also dealing with people who are concerned about the future of the country as well as their own future. We are dealing with senior citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe, as indicated by Senator Woodley, that all of these people would have known, let alone understood, the statement made about this legislation in mid-1992. It would be unfair to expect that these people would have acted in accordance with the press statement. In any event, is what is being proposed now precisely what was proposed in that press statement of 1992? Perhaps it is but that need not have been so when we think about the time that has elapsed since that announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For crying out loud, two years would have elapsed since then. It seems incredible that the government has taken this long to enshrine in legislation certain features of that 1992 press release. It is not an adequate way of going about the business of government. We always have to balance the issues before us. I do not deny that, at certain times if a matter urgently needs attention and the parliament is not sitting, the appropriate responsible minister on behalf of the government can make a statement which gives fair warning about what needs to be done to rectify a glaring problem. If it is of such urgency and importance the government should be required to take legislative action to implement that as soon as the parliament sits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is two years ago. I do not think it is the way that we should be operating in this chamber because to do so is to give carte blanche to the government to say something in 1992 and then wait until 1994 to implement it. Honourable senators should perhaps consider that very carefully. As I say, I would not give leave because Senator Woodley was quite right in what he did&mdash;procedurally that is; I am not supporting the retrospective element that is contained in his amendment to Senator Patterson's amendment but, procedurally, he adopted the correct course. It might be awkward for the minister to have to pick and chose&mdash;for example, if somebody makes a batch of biscuits and asks you to take a pick, you could say, `I don't need it; I've got me hammer'. The government could use its sledgehammer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would suggest that Senator Woodley knew what he was doing. I am quite content, procedurally, to follow his lead. Yet I will be voting against that retrospectivity and supporting Senator Patterson's amendment. Certainty before the law is one of the linchpins of good government, and to leave legislative action, which was indicated in a statement, for two years is not a proper exercise of good government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Senator Harradine has refused leave, the choice before the committee is very simple: the committee can either support Senator Patterson's original amendment, which would mean that the effect of this change would not take place until 1994; or support Senator Woodley's proposal and make the change effective as of 1992. Senator Woodley would argue that this is not retrospective because that was the date on which a change was announced by press release. We on this side of the chamber disagree. It is not sufficient for the government to rule by edict. It is not sufficient for the government to announce a change and then expect everybody to behave accordingly, simply on the basis of an announced proposal for a change, and that is the key.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger is that no government can be assured that it will get exactly what it wants. The Australian Democrats should understand very clearly that, if they agreed to government by edict, they would abrogate their right to amend legislation. I say therefore to Senator Woodley that it is very dangerous simply to move this amendment and say, `We will make these changes effective as of the date of the press release', because, in so doing, the Democrats lose their leverage as one of the parties that sits at the end of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very dangerous for the Greens (WA) and for Senator Harradine to support such a proposal&mdash;I understand that Senator Harradine is not&mdash;simply because it locks the minor parties into whatever the government press release happens to be at the time, and we do not think that that is a terribly wise course of action; but it is also very dangerous because it subordinates the rights of Australians not to the rule of the parliament but to the rule of the ministers and their advisers. This is something we cannot allow happen, especially in this case because we are talking about people who hold allocated pensions and, as Senator Harradine said, these people have made their contribution to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley could argue that it is sufficient to be knowledgeable of the government's intention to legislate. But we return to the premise on which Senator Harradine ended, which was certainty of the law. There could well be differences between a press release and the actual legislation as it passes this chamber, even if the legislation were to give effect to the intention of the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one says that individuals must govern their conduct according to what the government announces as its likely changes, it means that individuals have to read the announcement and try to formulate their behaviour accordingly. But what if an individual were to read the government's press release, attempt to act accordingly and then find that, by virtue of the way in which the legislation was finally worded, he or she fell outside the ambit? That person would have absolutely no recourse at all to say, `Look, I attempted to behave in the fashion in which the government told me I should', because it is the letter of the law as it passes parliament which determines that person's rights and responsibilities, not the wording of the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press release has absolutely no status in law. One cannot go before the court and say, `I ought to be excused from these particular obligations because I followed what I thought was the intention of a press release.' That is a nonsense. Sir William Blackstone said that one had to have certainty in the law and that ignorance of the law was no excuse; but at least one knew the words of the law. It is wholly unreasonable for any senator to say, `We will allow the government to rule by press release.' It is dangerous because it abrogates the rights of the minor parties in this chamber to have an impact on the legislation, and it abrogates the rights of individuals to certainty. Instead, it reduces individuals to uncertainty because they first try to act in accordance with the press release and then they find that, even with their best endeavours, they fall outside the scope of the legislation. </PARA>

Amendments to give effect to those changes were enacted by the parliament in division 19 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992, but they have not commenced as their implementation was deferred until the later of 1 October 1993 or the date of the report to the Senate by a Senate standing or select committee on the application of division 19. To date no report has been made to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992 provide, from 1 July 1994&mdash;I think this goes to Senator Patterson's question&mdash;for the repeal of the amendments made by division 19 and its commencement provision, and the account balance of allocated pensions and allocated annuities to be subject to the assets test. These amendments mean that there is no change to the current income test treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities. The only changes are to the treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities under the assets test. We estimate that some 300 social security clients would be affected, with an annual reduction in outlays of about $0.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not support opposition amendments to those proposed by the government because we consider that the savings provisions, particularly those proposed by the Democrats, would introduce additional complexity and confusion for many social security clients yet benefit only several hundred people. They also run counter to an objective of the social security incomes and assets test review that is currently under way, and that is the promotion of greater simplicity in this area of social security law and administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet, could I make it clear that, as I have said, while the government would have a strong preference for a no savings provision&mdash;that is, we would want to oppose both of the amendments&mdash;on balance, if necessary, we would prefer the amendment proposed by Senator Woodley for the reasons so succinctly outlined by the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That demonstrates the point that Senator Harradine, Senator O'Chee and I are making&mdash;that, irrespective of which way they go, it is not the same as the announcement. Until people have the law in front of them and know how to arrange their affairs, it is not, I believe, legitimate to expect people to behave in a certain way on the basis of an announcement. Senator Woodley was nitpicking in some ways when he talked about whether it was a press release or announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just how do older people respond if they are not using a financial adviser? The minister might say that all older people use a financial adviser. At church on Sunday I was chatting to someone who is 86. This person was widowed when she was 50 and has worked all her life. In fact, she still works full time two days a week. She said to me last year, `Kay, I am terribly sorry but I have to apply for a pension because I cannot manage any longer on my income. I have had to go from four days a week to two days a week.' At the age of 85 she went from four days a week to two days a week employment, having been widowed at 50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She looks after all her financial affairs. She assists people in her block of flats in the same way because she was a bookkeeper and has kept share portfolios for the person for whom she has been working. The other day she said to me, `I got this letter from social security that said that my part pension was going to be reduced by 70c a fortnight.' She finds the carry-on in respect of her getting a part pension absolutely amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people out there like her&mdash;many of them are able people&mdash;who are looking after their own financial affairs. In particular, many of these people whose portfolios are small and who manage them themselves rely on announcements in the financial part of the major newspapers in making their decisions. They would be getting a filtered version of the government's announcement because the government has not sent its announcement in its pure form to every older person who is investing. These people are getting a filtered version in line with the media's interpretation of the statement and the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Woodley that it really is nitpicking to criticise Senator O'Chee for mentioning the press release. Whether it is statement or press release, it is still not law; and the minister has admitted that the legislation is not the same as the original statement. We can expect people to operate only on the basis of the law and what is in the law, not what they think the government is going to do; because we know this government does not do what it says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should think of pensioners who, before the last election, would have made plans because the government said they would be taken out of the tax system by 1995. The government announced that in a major statement in every piece of paper directed to older people by every Labor candidate and sitting member standing for re-election, telling pensioners they would be taken out of the tax system. That happened up until the week of the election. Five days after the election Mr Dawkins made an announcement saying, `Oh, that should not have been said. It was an error. We did not mean it. I am sorry, you are not going to be taken out of the tax system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners could have made decisions before that. There was a statement by the government on material put out by ministers; they could have believed that. How are they supposed to operate when the government tells them that they will be taken out of the tax system, and they might have arranged their affairs on that basis? They have learned by now that the government does not always do what it says. I believe that it is only right and proper that these things be based on legislation and not on statements, press releases or whatever other words we would like to use, when the government announces its policy that it may or may not bring in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that I have is to know whether the Greens are going to support the Australian Democrats amendment&mdash;and I suppose it would be useful for you, Madam Temporary Chairman, to know too, in terms of supporting this legislation.

What they need to understand is that I indicated in my speech on the second reading and this morning that what the Australian Democrats really wanted in terms of this legislation was for any change to the assets testing of allocated pensions to be put off until the income and assets test review. Then we could have dealt with all of the problems. We would have them before us and we could have dealt with all the new answers, the dates and so on. But we could not get any agreement to that, either from the government or from the opposition; so we have had to go to a fall back position, which is not our preference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron should not tell me that I am somehow denigrating the position of the committee. He needs to understand that if the opposition had agreed in the first place to the proposals we were making, the whole issue could have been addressed and there would have been a sensible approach to the whole issue.

He is now saying that negotiation did not proceed and, therefore, we should introduce retrospectivity because the law had not been passed. It is a non sequitur. I do not want to waste the time of the chamber in pursuing this, but Senator Woodley either deliberately&mdash;and I do not believe it was deliberate because I would not impute that motive to him; I respect him&mdash;or otherwise has missed the point of what was said previously by Senator Harradine, Senator O'Chee and me.

We would definitely prefer the position that has been put so well by Senator Woodley, that the whole issue be put off until the income and assets test review is finalised later this year. To comment on the opposition's amendment, if Senator Herron's party had stuck with the point he was raising earlier, its amendment would not have moved that it commence at some time in the future; but that the change should start at midnight the day before it is decided in the Senate. That would be a way of providing that no unfairness or windfalls could occur.

<PARA>This amendment will delay the commencement of these increased deferment periods until 1 July 1995. While the government amendments have been presented under the title of reciprocal obligations, the only other white paper initiative to be introduced in July 1994 is the increased rate of payment of the jobstart subsidy. The youth training allowance will not be introduced until 1 January 1995. The more flexible income support arrangements, including the extension of allowable activities under the activities test and the ability to advance future income support payments, will not be introduced until March next year. The introduction of the parenting allowance, the changes to the allowance income test and the changes to eligibility for the partner allowance will not occur until July 1995. Finally, and very importantly, the white paper itself on page 109 cites 1995-96 as the first full year of the jobs compact. </PARA>

For these reasons the Democrats believe that, if the proposed increased penalties are to be approved by this chamber, they should not be introduced until 1995. We believe it is important to be giving positive encouragement to unemployed people before increasing the overhanging threat of penalties. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are once against modelled on the ideas contained in the coalition's policy at the last election. The government has been content up to now to leave people on the dole to the detriment of both those who are experiencing long-term unemployment and the community.

The Democrats have not given us any convincing grounds for delaying the start-up date of the enhanced reciprocal obligations except for some vague statement that the start-up date should coincide with the rest of the white paper initiatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let a couple of the comments made by Senator Patterson go unanswered. She seems to think that the government's current or past policies on the unemployed are soft. I assure Senator Patterson that if we look around the OECD countries and countries of the western world, we find that we have some of the most rigorous requirements for people to access some sort of income support. If evidence of this is required, one has only to talk to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army. They will say that there are enormous numbers of people who are either serving out waiting periods or undergoing various requirements under the Social Security Act and who are simply unable to access what Senator Patterson appears to believe is a soft system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these new provisions I argue that the people who will be caught out are those with a mental illness as opposed to a physical illness&mdash;an illness that is not severe enough to provide them with a disability support pension or an illness that is not of a long term nature and therefore does not allow them to qualify for any sort of sickness benefit. These provisions will catch out those people who have poor social and communication skills. They will catch out the people who do not have an advocate to speak on their behalf. They will hit young people without parents to keep an eye on them and ensure they have replied to letters, kept forms up to date, met various requirements and so on. I see these punitive measures as another step backwards. I do not think they contain anything that can be called reciprocal obligations because of the limited number of job opportunities out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson spoke about getting the long-term unemployed into jobs. However, first and foremost the jobs must exist. Surely the best thing this government can do is to start encouraging people, assisting the long term unemployed, people who are totally demoralised. That is a preferable course to offering such people little more than bigger and bigger sticks and pushing people to the point at which many will have to fall back on charities. Will the minister make available additional moneys to our charities to offset these amendments the government is now pushing through? It will be the charities that will have to carry the families of those who under these provisions will be cut off from unemployment benefits. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Senator Lees's perspective the government is sometimes too harsh and that was her assessment of these amendments. Therefore, the Australian Democrats have proposed an amendment that there be a warning to the clients that a deferment period will apply, with continuation of the payment until that period is completed. On technological grounds the Democrats' amendment cannot be supported. I am advised that it would not achieve the intended effect in all cases. As drafted, it would require in some cases payment to people who would no longer qualify for jobsearch or newstart allowance. That could create a precedent for other recipients and would have severe financial implications for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government is sympathetic to the principle underlying the proposed amendment&mdash;that is, to give notice of impending non-payment to a client. The government is willing to consider administrative measures to achieve this and, if necessary, legislative amendments in later sittings. The minister has advised that he has asked officials to work very closely with those concerned with welfare rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue was fairly well canvassed during the committee proceedings last week and points raised by senators during those proceedings were appreciated. I hope that Senator Woodley has noted the sympathetic way in which the government treated the issues raised by the welfare rights representative and indeed by Senator Woodley himself. It is a matter of balance. There has already been considerable investment by the government in seeking to assist people who are long-term unemployed to get a job and to retain it. Certainly by these amendments the government wants to make clear to people the seriousness of its commitment to encourage people into employment and for them to stay there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously I appreciate, as does the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, expressions of concern in this area. We wish to make clear that the government is serious in its intentions to assist people. We also wish to ensure that the principle involving the giving of notice of impending non-payment will be treated sympathetically. Although we will not accept the proposed amendment today, I hope my contribution will have met the points raised by Senator Woodley. </PARA>

The government has emergency relief payments available if people who are in breach of the legislation find themselves in need. Certainly the government does not agree with the presumption that there will be a significant number of people in this category. </PARA>

From my experience recently involving somebody who has been looking very intently for a job, there are not just one or two people applying for each job vacancy; in many cases hundreds of people apply for the same position. Perhaps the minister would like to talk to some of the people in Adelaide who have recently advertised for young people.

Indeed, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has said that he will work very closely with the welfare rights people on this matter. In light of the sympathetic way in which the government has understood the intent of the amendments, and the fact that they are badly drafted, I urge the committee's reconsideration. </PARA>

We are quite happy to match it with the minister's advice later on but, if we let this issue go now, we would have no way of enforcing it later on. If the government believes further amendments are needed, we would welcome those amendments.

If the government was concerned that the drafting of the amendments was such that they would have unintended consequences and would not actually totally do what the Democrats hoped they would do, the government should have had the decency actually to approach the Democrats and to advise us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have moved these amendments on this aspect of the bill with the intention of ensuring that people who come off the disability wage supplement will not have to reapply for the disability support pension. These amendments will be supported by the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are designed to ensure that there is no gap between people coming off the disability wage supplement and getting back on to the disability support pension. This approach is consistent with the approach the coalition took to the amendments to the mature age allowance. As I stated in the second reading stage, the disability wage supplement is itself supported by the coalition. It provides an opportunity for people with disabilities to work in open employment but to be paid less than the award wage, based on their productivity compared with a person in the same occupation who does not have a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I mentioned at the second reading stage of this bill, the coalition was concerned that people coming off the disability wage supplement should not be left without support but should automatically qualify for the disability support pension. The coalition believes that such people should not have to make a new claim for the disability support pension, especially as such a claim can take up to eight weeks because of the medical examination requirements. While these amendments provide an automatic entitlement to the disability support pension to a person coming off the disability wage supplement, they do not prevent the Department of Social Security from reviewing the person at a subsequent date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In conjunction with my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, I wish to raise in the Senate today the collapse of the Brisbane Tribal Council. The collapse of that body raises a number of questions in relation to the administration and accountability of public funds, matters which are the concern of this parliament and of the state parliament. My concerns have their origin in the report of the receivers for the Brisbane Tribal Council, which was lodged at the Supreme Court in Queensland in October last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brisbane Tribal Council was incorporated on 12 August 1977 after some years of operation as an unlisted public company limited by guarantee. Its objectives were, broadly, to provide accommodation for needy Aboriginals and Islanders; to assist Aboriginals and Islanders in welfare claims; to collect data and research into the housing problems of Aboriginals and Islanders; to bring before the public problems encountered by these groups to promote understanding of their problems; and to conduct training courses for volunteers to carry out the objectives of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sole source of funding for the council came from the federal and state governments and exceeded $1 million per year. It managed and controlled a number of business entities, including the Gwandalan Community Correction Centre, funded by the Queensland Corrective Services Commission, which paid the Brisbane Tribal Council a management fee of $398,000 per annum for this service; DBW Lodge, a youth bail hostel funded by ATSIC, the initial funding for which was somewhere between $600,000 and $750,000; Georgina, an aged persons hostel funded by ATSIC and Health, Housing and Community Services. The Purga Mission, a 35-hectare property outside Ipswich, was also owned by the council. Additionally, it operated a secretariat at 39 Lytton Road, East Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the secretary of the council, conscious of her fiduciary duties, placed the company in the hands of the receiver as it was no longer solvent. The receivers were Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. In their report they noted many problems, including an excessive use of cash cheques, poor bookkeeping and an accounting deficiency of over $600,000. The receiver was obviously concerned about the operations of the council, but made it perfectly clear that it was not within his brief to pursue the matter. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to determine whether the funds provided by the funding bodies have been misappropriated a detailed investigation would be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>The receiver laid down time frames and areas for further investigation. Many months have now passed since that report was put down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the recommended further investigations not been carried out by either ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit or any other internal audit mechanism? Why has the government allowed the insolvency of this ATSIC- and HHACS-funded body to pass without comment or investigation? Why has the government not insisted that ATSIC's role in making grants without requiring proper accountability or acquittal be investigated? Initial inquiries suggest that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been misappropriated over the years, yet ATSIC and the other federal and state government departments have done nothing. In fact, it could be suggested that ATSIC may  have helped cover the trail. It has ignored offers of a full and complete re-audit of the BTC books for over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Grant money was spent on florists, on hire cars for prisoners and supervisors, on funerals, on court fines and on improvements at the home of BTC coordinator, Mr Don Davidson. Grant money was used to give loans to individuals, including a $10,000 loan given to Mr Davidson in the form of a cash cheque drawn from an ATSIC grant account. Mr Don Davidson was one of the founders of the Brisbane Tribal Council. He appeared to have complete control. The directors and employees were almost entirely family members. Most of the problems seem to have occurred in the last five or six years. Mr Davidson died last year after a long and debilitating illness. His eyesight was failing to the extent that he could no longer see the cheques he was signing. In fact, at one stage Mr Davidson wrote to ATSIC claiming he was signing, and had signed, cheques under protest and requested ATSIC assistance with this. Apparently nothing was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The receiver's reports showed that the accounting records were not properly maintained so as to enable true and fair accounts to be prepared. No general ledger was maintained. It would appear that this was a longstanding deficiency as final accounts were prepared by the auditors, Ken and Don Hayward, chartered accountants, in prior years on a spreadsheet basis from the cashbooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In bringing the accounts up to date, the receiver found that a number of large value cash cheques had been written which had no supporting vouchers or documentation&mdash;page 32, paragraph 9.3&mdash;and indicated that a detailed investigation would be necessary to determine whether funds provided by funding bodies had been misapplied. There can be no question that the receiver was concerned that opportunities existed for fraud but was unable to pursue and resolve the matter because his terms of appointment restrained him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two examples can be quoted: in November 1992 the Commonwealth Department of Health and Community Services provided a grant of approximately $885,000 for the tribal council to purchase and refurbish the Georgina Aged Persons Hostel. The council was permitted to excise and dispose of an unrequired portion of that property and subsequently sold that portion for $138,000. The cash book shows a payment into a fixed deposit account of $100,000 which remains unaccounted for. The receiver's report also lists unsecured creditors. This includes an overpayment of $62,000 from the Queensland Corrective Services Commission for management fees. Why was that paid in advance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the people involved as a recipient of moneys from the Brisbane Tribal Council was Mr Sugar Ray Robinson. He is an ATSIC commissioner and chairman of the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service. Through an active involvement in the affairs of the Brisbane Tribal Council and now as an ATSIC commissioner, Mr Robinson has a fundamental conflict of interest. He must stand aside as an ATSIC commissioner until such time as an independent inquiry has been completed into the Brisbane Tribal Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the auditors, Ken and Don Hayward, chartered accountants, must also be examined. Were the audits conducted in a manner which allowed the auditors to claim accurately that the expenditure of public funds was properly accounted for? Apparently no audit was ever qualified, despite the poor standard of bookkeeping. This is a matter that requires investigation by an independent body such as the Australian Securities Commission. ATSIC itself had both an obligation and the capacity to audit the tribal council. It failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no wish to pursue any member in relation to the Brisbane Tribal Council but I am concerned, and I am sure everyone in this parliament is concerned, that public moneys are properly accounted for and that public funds are spent for the purpose for which parliament appropriated them. There is so much vagueness about where the funds of the Brisbane Tribal Council went that there must be an independent inquiry at the highest level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have therefore written to the Auditor-General asking him to undertake an audit of the Brisbane Tribal Council from 1988 to 1994, paying particular reference to the following: first, any improprieties in the administration of funds granted to the Brisbane Tribal Council and associated bodies during the years 1988 to 1994; second, the adequacy of arrangements within ATSIC and its predecessors during the period 1988 to 1994 to account for and acquit accurately funds received by the Brisbane Tribal Council and associated bodies, and the part played by the Office of Evaluation and Audit in ATSIC; third, the adequacy of arrangements within the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services during the period 1988 to 1994 to account for and acquit accurately funds received by the Brisbane Tribal Council and associated bodies; fourth, the adequacy of auditing procedures carried out by Ken and Don Hayward, chartered accountants, into the Brisbane Tribal Council from 1988 to 1992; fifth, whether any person or persons intervened to prevent the proper audit of the accounts of the Brisbane Tribal Council after the company was placed in the hands of the receiver; and, sixth, to ensure that all the points raised by the receiver as being worthy of further investigation are thoroughly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been researching this matter since May this year. I have in the chamber with me three very voluminous files of the records of the Brisbane Tribal Council. I would have no hesitation in supporting my claim that there needs to be an independent, high-level inquiry into the affairs of the Brisbane Tribal Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator MacGibbon in his call for this matter to be investigated by the Auditor-General. It is  interesting that this matter is of such major importance that both Senator MacGibbon and I have been working on it&mdash;and, I might say, until recently unbeknown to each other. It is a matter that has concerned various members of the Brisbane Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and we have been approached independently, in both cases because there is very great concern about what has happened to the Brisbane Tribal Council Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company was established by Donald Davidson in 1977 and has been representative of the Aboriginal community in the greater Brisbane area since that time. It is the largest Aboriginal organisation in Queensland. The objects of the company show that it was established to provide accommodation for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and to assist them in obtaining social welfare. The company owned and operated four properties: the Gwandalan Community Correction Centre at Woolloongabba; the DB Walker Lodge, which is a bail youth hostel at Morningside; the Georgina Thompson-Davidson aged care hostel at Morningside; and the Purga Mission at Ipswich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gwandalan Community Correction Centre acts as a halfway house for prisoners released to work, and up to 25 inmates reside there. The DB Walker Lodge is the bail youth hostel to accommodate Aboriginal youths released from court on bail and can accommodate up to 25 people. The aged care hostel is a hostel to cater for sick and aged in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and has two houses, one providing for patients who require medical treatment and the other caring for patients who are totally dependent on trained medical staff. There are about 20 residents of that hostel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company is a non-profit generating entity and is totally funded by various government grants. Gwandalan is funded by the Queensland Corrective Services Commission and the commission pays a management fee of almost $400,000 per annum. The DB Walker Lodge is funded as to capital by ATSIC. The aged care hostel is partly funded by the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, as it was then called, partly by ATSIC and partly by pensions of the tenants of the hostel. In addition, ATSIC funds the secretariat of the company. In all, collective funding for the company is in excess of $1 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company is unable to pay its bills and a receiver-manager has been appointed. At the time of the appointment of the receiver-manager, the company had liabilities consisting of a $62,000 overdraft to the Commonwealth Bank; nine other overdrawn accounts to the Commonwealth Bank totalling some $200,000; leases of vehicles with an indebtedness of $30,000-odd; debts owing to unsecured creditors&mdash;that is, small businessmen around the Brisbane area&mdash;of $135,000; and unremitted group tax of approximately $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good work the Brisbane Tribal Council did in the past has been put in jeopardy by threats from Telecom to disconnect the phone, from the Commonwealth Bank to call in loans, and by the fact that, if the company is put into liquidation by any of the unsecured creditors, the whole thing will collapse and those Aboriginal people requiring accommodation and assistance will have nowhere to turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very courageous Aboriginal lady by the name of Elizabeth Ditton, who is also secretary of the company, in an attempt to extricate the company from its financial problems and to allow it to continue its work arranged for the appointment of the receiver-manager. Ms Ditton was appointed a director of the company in December 1992 and was appointed secretary in February 1993. As secretary, she arranged for an investigation of the company that uncovered massive fraud involving hundreds of thousands of dollars and extending back at least 10 years. My colleague Senator MacGibbon has mentioned some of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unknown portion of the state and federal moneys paid to the company for the operation of Aboriginal hostels and care for Aboriginal aid persons and the supervision of Aboriginal businesses was, instead, being syphoned off into the pockets or homes of company officers and their relatives and associates. Public moneys have been spent on items such as hire cars for prisoners under care, home renovations and travel; and there are large sums of money that are simply unaccounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Curiously enough, this fraud has remained undetected during yearly audits conducted since 1988 by Ken and Don Hayward, chartered accountants, of Brisbane. I understand that Ken Hayward is, as well, the Queensland Minister for Health. The receivers, upon appointment, found that the deficiency in funds, thought to be in the range of $360,000, was actually more in the vicinity of $600,000. The receivers in their report to the Queensland Supreme Court highlighted the need for an investigation to determine whether the funds provided by Commonwealth and state funding bodies had been misappropriated. The receivers' report is filed in the Supreme Court. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it became apparent that a number of large value cash cheques had been written, which had no supporting vouchers or documentation. Further, it was determined that the cash book section, to a certain extent, may not have reflected the actual nature of the expense.</PARA>
<PARA>Further investigations carried out by Ms Ditton and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> investigative reporter Phil Dickie showed that Mr Davidson personally received $21,268 from the Brisbane Tribal Council in May 1993, the month before he died. Only about $2,000 was in the form of salary for his job, the balance being made up of `consultancies', `hire cars' and `security', and also a `personal loan' of $10,000, which I understand my colleague has mentioned. In addition, he signed more than $2,000 worth of cash cheques for unspecified purposes. According to the investigations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>, in December 1992 there was a record of a term deposit of $100,000 being made, but beyond that date no records of that money exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investigation also revealed evidence of `ghost employees' being paid huge amounts. In fact, in 1991 the company was required to reimburse more than $6,000 in subsidy payments to the Commonwealth Employment Service after it was discovered that five trainees who were supposedly working for the company were not actually working for it. A $62,000 overpayment by the Queensland Corrective Services Commission was demanded by the Queensland minister to be repaid, but the receiver's report shows that in excess of that amount is still shown as owing to the Queensland Corrective Services Commission, which means that none of that $62,000 incorrectly paid has yet been refunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1993, the Queensland parliament was assured that there were no irregularities in the administration of the Corrective Services Commission contract with the company, but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> reports that gangs of prisoners performed at least some of the extensive renovation and extension work carried out at the home of Mr Don Davidson. Documents I have in my possession also show that some prisoners under so-called supervision of the company were listed as drivers of Hertz hire cars rented by the Brisbane Tribal Council. There is a suggestion, from documents and correspondence I have in my possession, that up to $30,000 worth of improvements were made to the home of Don Davidson by the company. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> reports that the company also paid for much of the repairs and maintenance to Mr Davidson's household and that, as well, the rates on Mr Davidson's property in Cooktown, in Far North Queensland, were paid by the company. </PARA>

The books of the company show a large number of cheques being written out to cash, and the making of personal loans to company officers.

This was obviously not done. In spite of audited reports by Ken and Don Hayward, chartered accountants, over the years, the accountants appear never to have raised any concern with the irregularities. It is now becoming obvious that many leading auditors around this nation had adopted a fairly laissez-faire attitude to audits of major companies. I am pleased to see that some of these high profile auditors of major companies are now being taken to court by creditors to account for their indifference. </PARA>

Interestingly, a few months later correspondence signed by Mr Davidson, which I have in my possession, shows that Mr Robinson was paid by the Brisbane Tribal Council an amount of $3846 said to be `wages for eight weeks work experience' at the Brisbane Tribal Council Ltd. The letter forwarding Mr Robinson his money says that the company hopes the knowledge Mr Robinson gained while receiving `work experience' with the company would be of benefit to him in the future. It is a most unusual way in which work experience recipients are paid almost $500 a week for the work experience. However, this amount was not paid in weekly instalments but, rather, was paid in a lump sum.

Interestingly, in spite of the recommendations of the receiver in his report to the Brisbane Supreme Court dated 8 October 1993, and in spite of a two-page expose in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of 8 May 1994, it seems that neither the Commonwealth nor the state government appear to have taken any interest whatsoever in the alleged misappropriation of moneys supplied by governments for the welfare of Aboriginal and Islander people in the Brisbane area. </PARA>

Unfortunately, those avenues were not then available to a black ward of the state.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A close reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry Report into Population and Development</EMPHASIS> shows that population growth is not the problem that many people think it is," Senator Harradine said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The message which emerges time and again from the Inquiry Report is that population growth as such is rarely a problem," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For example the Inquiry accepts that `there is little direct evidence on whether rapid population growth causes poverty.' (Final Report Executive Summary, p 3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It also accepts that `the effects of population growth on the environment are not unequivocally positive or negative.' (Final Report Executive Summary p 3)."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine said the inquiry acknowledged that `in many areas where the effects of reducing population growth are commonly judged to be advantageous (e.g. education, exhaustible resources, poverty, savings), the benefits of population policies are likely to be modest compared to the benefits of more direct policies that accomplish the same ends.' (Final Report p 5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"What is disappointing about the Report is that, although it concedes that population growth is not the essential problem, it is willing to endorse population policies as second best solutions because governments are unwilling to adopt direct policies in the first place," Senator Harradine said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Inquiry says `If governments seek to improve the economic position of the poor, it is best, where possible, to use direct policy instruments, such as increased access of the poor to land, credit, public infrastructure, and services, particularly education and health. Some of these policies will be opposed by powerful pressure groups.' (Final Report p 19).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The contributors concede that poverty, environmental damage, educational inequalities, poor housing etc are caused by factors other than population growth per se.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is therefore erroneous for the Inquiry to conclude that `slowing population growth from high current levels, especially in poor, agrarian societies facing pressure on land and resources, is advantageous to economic development, health, food availability, housing, poverty, the environment and possibly education.' (Final Report p 30).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine said the inquiry had seriously failed to meet a requirement in its terms of reference by providing information which will allow the Government `to assess the relative costs and benefits of population activities in achieving improvements in development indicators vis-a-vis alternative policies' (Preface p i) even though the Inquiry conceded superior direct policies exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"What is urgent is an independent assessment of the relative costs and benefits," Senator Harradine said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is particularly vital in areas of maternal and child health. The paper by Montgomery and Lloyd from the Population Council of New York&mdash;an Institute well known for its population control advocacy&mdash;failed to identify alternative measures to overcome high infant and maternal mortality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Third World feminists themselves have pleaded for more money for health programs rather than it being spent on population control. Bangladeshi women's activist Farida Akhter appealed last year to PM Paul Keating: "If you're giving any money at all, don't give it to the population controllers. We don't have money for health programs. Please, divert it to health programs."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major failing of the report was its downplaying the violation of individual human rights inherent in many target-driven population control programs", Senator Harradine said.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference for the Inquiry obliged it to "review the evidence on the links between population growth and development" to provide information to allow the Federal Government of Australia "to assess the relative costs and benefits of population activities in achieving improvements in development indicators vis-a-vis alternative policies". As well as looking at the relationship between population growth and economic growth, health, housing, education, wealth distribution, food, resources, and environmental issues, the Inquiry was directed to look at the human rights issues involved with population policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My overall impression of the Report is that the Inquiry team has done a very creditworthy job in reviewing a substantial body of literature on these various, mostly complex, issues and has provided you with a review that gives a generally well balanced view of where knowledge of these subjects stands at present. From an academic viewpoint, the review is a very useful compilation and analysis of the research done in these areas and points to many areas where current knowledge is inadequate and further research is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major criticism of the Report, as you will see below, implicitly reflects the omission of an economist from the team with expertise in economic growth issues. This would have given a needed macro-economic and general equilibrium breadth to the review. Another criticism that I should mention at this point is that the Executive Summary issued does not reflect fully the thoughtful, generally balanced presentation I found in the individual chapters of the Report. Someone reading only the Summary would not get a full idea of the complexity of the interactions in the relationships discussed or of the policy implications drawn out by the authors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early part of the Report is concerned with the relationship between population growth and economic growth (usually measured as per capita GDP). Here, the Report focuses mainly on simple correlations or regressions between population growth and per capita GDP growth, in particular on a body of research stemming from Kuznets' (1967) paper showing that there wasn't any simple cross-country correlation between them. Subsequent work confirmed this result for later time periods, however, Prof. Kelley of the Inquiry team has, in recent studies, found a negative relationship between these two variables for some developing countries in data covering the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus on this simple relationship is almost entirely misplaced. It was useful for Kuznets to compare the data in this way to show that one could not draw general conclusions about economic growth rates from what happens to population growth rates. But this simple relationship does not provide an adequate framework within which to look for the sources of growth. For this purpose a framework of analysis drawing together land, labour, human and physical capital, and technology is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an easily accepted and widely demonstrated statistic that high-income, developed countries have low population growth rates. But with the diverse group of what are presently developing countries, there need be no systematic relationship between these two variables. Over a period of time some fast-growing developing countries will have population growth slowing because they have begun a demographic transition&mdash;usually as a result of improving living standards&mdash;as costs of educating children have increased, infant mortality has fallen, life expectancy has increased, health of women has improved, and the birth rate has fallen. In other countries, population growth may be increasing and income increasing, because even though infant mortality has fallen and life expectancy has increased, the birth rate has not adjusted to these changed circumstances. In other countries the population growth rate may be increasing as income grows because the population is adjusting towards some optimal, higher level. Population may adjust to a higher level even though per capita income is not growing very fast (after all, people are a resource, especially educated people). And then there are the most unfortunate cases of countries at very low per capita income levels where population growth may be outstripping income growth (for the open-access resource reasons that Prof. Panayotou suggests may exist in some very poor countries with highly inadequate property rights, especially for land).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to make the point that it is not possible to make a general argument that slowing population growth will increase economic growth. Cause and effect does not run in this direct&mdash;or, at least it mainly goes in the opposite direction, from economic development to slower population growth. Indeed, the Report mostly accepts this view, although the focus of Prof. Kelley's chapter on this relationship could be misleading. It would have been better to have had a broader discussion of the relationships in the economic growth process, showing how population growth was largely endogenous to the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the relationship between population growth and social indicators or aspects of economic well-being&mdash;such as health, education, food availability, housing, resources, and the environment&mdash;the Report generally provides a balanced review of the literature. On most counts the available evidence does not point to a negative impact from high population growth&mdash;especially evidence from cross-country studies. This is not surprising. As the authors show, the two-way flow of effects between these variables is important and pervasive&mdash;between fertility and health, fertility and income, and fertility and education or the environment. For example, in the absence of coercion, family planning services will only be used if family demand for greater control over fertility exists. But if demand for reduced fertility is increasing as economic development takes place (and/or infant mortality declines), it is hard to sort out the direct effects of the public provision of family services from the family planning that would have taken place regardless. Moreover, since individual country circumstances are so different, cross-country analysis presents enormous problems in isolating effects. Because of the pervasiveness of the feedbacks between these variables, examination of simple correlations between variables and drawing conclusions about cause and effect is dangerous&mdash;a fundamental problem which the authors acknowledge but sometimes neglect in their conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point to come out of the chapters on those issues, and one which the authors emphasise, is that population growth is not the main variable on which policy in developing countries should focus in order to make major improvements in environmental conditions, food availability, education, housing, etc. The first-best policies to resolve the problems that arise in these areas are far superior. Government policies should focus mainly on establishing appropriate property rights, making sure that activities generating externalities are taxed or otherwise penalised, providing education&mdash;especially at primary level, and especially for females&mdash;giving women equal rights and opportunities, etc. As Prof. Ahlburg says: "If the government seeks to improve the economic position of the poor, the largest and quickest impact will come from the most direct policy instruments available. Amongst such instruments are policies to increase access of the poor to land, credit, public infrastructure, and services, particularly, education and health."(p.23)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But does this mean that because it is difficult to find strong positive relationships between slower population growth and the various aspects of economic well-being that provision of family planning services is not useful? As the Report makes clear, family planning information and services are valuable tools in helping a family maximise its economic welfare. Just as the family is better off with more education, more information about farming practices, more information about managing production or price risks, or more information about protecting against disease, so it is better off with more and better family planning information and services. However, providing education and information in all of these areas comes at a cost, either to the family, the taxpayer, or from foreign aid. Therefore, the important question is: which activity provides the greatest return? Unfortunately, as the Report's review of the evidence makes clear, the knowledge to answer the question with any accuracy does not exist at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, how much of the Australian foreign aid budget to devote to family planning services has to be a matter of judgement. But the judgement can be informed by the Report. The report makes clear that family planning services have to be part of a "package" of aid that focuses on economic development. To quote a statement from Prof. Panayotou (made in relation to correcting environmental problems but which is generally applicable): "The policy implications are threefold: (a). . . the emphasis of outside assistance and pressure should be primarily on policy reform and capacity building; (b) to accelerate the demographic transition, family planning services should be made available to those <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">who want and need them</EMPHASIS> [my emphasis]; (c) social and economic change that helps create demand for family planning should be emphasised, especially education, health and employment measures that benefit women. . . "(p.25)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of Human Rights, I am not an expert so I can only give you an uninformed impression of the chapter on this subject. Overall, I believe the various arguments on this highly sensitive topic were fairly canvassed. The author ends by providing a listing of what seem to be clear human rights violations which foreign aid decisions should consider in the provision of aid for family planning services. As Dr Mason states: "Forced sterilisation and abortion are regarded by most observers as clearly constituting an unacceptable violation of human rights." (see Abstract). Also, services which reward recruiters to family planning services or which penalise or reward communities for meeting targets or otherwise putting collective pressure on individuals generally are regarded as unethical, leading as they apparently do to the purveying of false information about the effects of family planning services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important consideration which Dr Mason stresses and which should also warrant close attention in aid projects of this nature is the "process by which population programs are created&mdash;in particular, whether the individuals most affected have a voice in the program's creation. . . " (see Abstract).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also make the point that, given the evidence is generally lacking of clearly adverse impacts of fertility decisions on collective well-being, it seems that it would be best to be very careful about sanctioning family planning services which look in any way to be infringing on a family's right to decide on the number of children born.</PARA>

<PARA>Members of the press should have a look at that because they have run off with the executive summary and presented a distorted picture to the people of Australia. Indeed, on the next page, Professor Duncan continues:</PARA>

Among such instruments are policies to increase access of the poor to land, credit, public infrastructure, and services, particularly, education and health."</PARA>
<PARA>Any member of the public reading the press report of the inquiry would not have got that message at all. Professor Duncan then makes some observations about family planning services, and they are in the documents I have tabled. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the important question is: which activity provides the greatest return? Unfortunately, as the Report's review of the evidence makes clear, the knowledge to answer the question with any accuracy does not exist at present.</PARA>

<PARA>He goes on about that particular matter. I believe that it is essential for the press and members of parliament to read carefully the document that was originally presented&mdash;this document, this review. The government has not done the cost-benefit analysis, which it said it would, of population activities in achieving development indicators vis-a-vis alternative programs that would more directly and more effectively attack the problems of poverty and inequality in developing countries. I have not got time to go into that. The government has not done that. What the government has said is that that it will be developing a stricter approach to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into the matter, I would suggest that honourable senators look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Estimates Committee A of 21 June, from page 345 on. They will see there some of the issues in respect of human rights that were raised by me and by others, including Senator O'Chee. This is a very important matter indeed. Professor Duncan made a comment about what Dr Oppenheim Mason said in the report. I observed in my press release that Dr Oppenheim Mason's paper was a disgrace&mdash;a violation of individual human rights inherent in many target-driven population control programs. That is the key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether these programs are demographically driven or target driven. If they are, then inherently they become coercive. I believe that, unfortunately, the government still has demographically driven population programs. I raised the question in regard to Vietnam. I raised the question about China. I even raised the question about Papua New Guinea. Indeed, in Papua New Guinea and in the Pacific islands now it is a demographically driven program that the government is about. It is not approaching the issue from the aspect of adopting development programs that will attack the problems more directly. In respect of human rights, Professor Duncan in his paper made this final statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also make the point that, given that evidence is generally lacking of clearly adverse impacts of fertility decision on collective well-being, it seems that it would be best to be very careful about sanctioning family planning services which look in any way to be infringing on a family's right to decide on the number of children born.</PARA>
<PARA>I was very pleased to see that the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Peacock, the opposition spokesperson, took Karen Oppenheim Mason to task. I quote an extract from a press release he issued on 19 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peacock said he was unequivocally in favour of safe and voluntary family planning services provided without reference to demographic goals. Mr Peacock simply cannot accept any undermining through the Australian aid program of parental freedom of choice. According to Oppenheim Mason, however, this is an `extreme' and `untenable' position. Oppenheim Mason's views on this issue, Mr Peacock says, are not credible as a basis for public policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true. If the government is going to print up this report and utilise it at the Cairo conference, I beg the government not to make a fool of Australia by having the Oppenheim Mason paper included, because it is an absolute disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Potestas in populo, authoritas in Senatu': power in the lower House, and authority in the Senate. When Cicero coined this expression over 2000 years ago, he was referring to an anomaly that is present in bicameral democracies&mdash;the anomaly of the upper house holding greater authority than the popularly elected lower house. Centuries later the debate still continues. Cicero's statement is as appropriate today as it was then. It is interesting that Cicero was a senator and that he was proscribed, that is, he was assassinated, on the order of Emperor Octavian. Today, Emperor Keating is advocating proscribing the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bicameralism is the division of a legislature into two parallel but separate political bodies which must act in agreement for legislation to be enacted into law. In supporting a bicameral system of national legislature, the overriding argument in favour of such a system is the role of the upper house in providing a check and balance on the operations of the lower house and the political executive. No less a person than Winston Churchill said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian upper house, the Senate, has the power to review and ultimately reject any legislation presented to it from the House of Representatives, making it one of the most powerful upper houses in the world. This power to review and block legislation is shared by many upper houses around the world and, although constitutional powers</PARA>
<PARA>differ in each, the review process is a dominant function in nearly every one. These powers are important, particularly given the increasing influence of the executive over the lower house. I remind the Senate of the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to absent himself from appearing in the House of Representatives whenever he wishes&mdash;a clear demonstration of the power of the executive over the lower house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive in many cases has a monopoly on drafting legislation and policies and has almost a guaranteed passage in the lower house. The second chamber is not only a safeguard against the hasty actions of the lower house; its accessibility to minority party and independent or non-aligned members allows for dissenting voices in the assembly. This capacity for dissent encourages genuine debate on legislation and, through committee review, permits time for the legislation to be digested by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, too, has benefited from the considered and detailed examination of legislation which the Senate, through its mechanisms such as the committee of the whole, selection of bills processes and the activities of the scrutiny committees, is able to provide. The scrutiny committee often picks up embarrassing oversights or errors, while the detailed legislative mechanisms enable the government to improve its own legislation in a considered way. Contrary to popular opinion, the majority of successful amendments in the Senate are actually moved by the government. Indeed, the extra time taken by the detailed consideration often enables the government to accommodate differing perspectives with which it agrees but which would have been omitted through hasty legislative activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of members in the upper houses, by virtue of the electoral process in place, means that it is possible for the ruling government of the day to have a minority in the upper house, as we have at present. Although this has been attacked as undermining the stability of government, it emphasises the point that members of the upper house may not feel pressured or duty bound to follow party lines but vote according to the merit of the legislation. I am delighted to be a member of the Liberal Party because I personally experienced this power shortly after entering this chamber, when I crossed the floor. I was able to exercise this power I have as a member of the Liberal Party. Certain political parties, of course, do not allow that. Although party politics is certainly evident in the upper house, the potential for party manipulation is greatly lessened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revisory power of the upper house is a prime argument supporting bicameralism. With the political executive becoming increasing dominant in legislative decision making, judicial appointments and vice-regal selections, as it is in many Commonwealth nations, the upper house is perhaps the only forum for true debate and scrutiny over legislation. Because of a lack of government control of the institution, the institution has been able to develop many structures and mechanisms which serve to improve the scrutiny of legislation, such as the various committee processes I have already mentioned. Once these mechanisms have been established, senators from all political parties frequently work in a non-partisan way at solving the legislative or policy proposals with which they are presented. This is not to deny that there are exceptions where strong political views are taken. It is, after all, a political institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some argue that the Australian Senate, the states house, was established as the price of federation. However, in an era of new federalism, where the states are gaining greater autonomy, the need for a forum for state issues may be seen as even more important, particularly in light of the declining control individual states have in premiers conferences and the Loan Council. Thus, in a federal system, the upper house's role may be seen as far more effective than in unitary systems. Under conditions where members of the upper house are democratically elected, the presence of such a chamber is just as important to the democratic process of government as the lower house. In the extreme, one commentator even suggests that if unicameralism is to be considered in Australia, the lower house should be the one that is abolished!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents of unicameralism point to Scandinavia and Pacific nations as models of cameral reform. Unicameral legislatures are operating in Denmark, Sweden, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. In the Scandinavian case, both countries embraced constitutional reforms in order to remove control from the monarchy and place it with the democratically elected legislature. The inherently conservative and unrepresentative upper houses were abolished by drafting new constitutions. In the New Zealand example, the Legislative Council&mdash;that is, the upper house&mdash;was abolished in 1950, not out of contempt for the house, but because of its failure as a revisory chamber. It was abolished in order to establish a more functional second chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These examples of functioning unicameral legislatures do not justify adopting unicameralism in federal systems as their relatively small size does not require strong regionally representative houses such as the Australian and American senates. It should be pointed out that the New Zealand legislature has recognised its failure as a revisory chamber and established a referral of bills system, quite some years before us, and no doubt the New Zealand experience has influenced us. Why did New Zealand establish such a system? It was because the government majority recognised that its control of the legislative process did not necessarily make for sound and considered law. Furthermore, through its haste, it is unable to take into account constituency concerns which frequently escape the policy and drafting processes&mdash;a true case of `marrying in haste and repenting at leisure'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Achieving unicameralism&mdash;that is, the creation of just one legislative assembly&mdash;will require massive constitutional change. History has proved the difficulty of amending the Australian constitution, only six amendments having been passed in over 90 years. While this alone does not stand as a convincing argument for bicameralism, it does suggest that alternatives to abolishing the upper house need to be considered. A review of the bicameral process is far more desirable than the rejection of the upper house. Reform and review can establish controls on both houses and still allow them to maintain their independence. The Australian Senate is, therefore, not just a relic of Westminster or its other antecedents, but an honourable institution of this great nation, which has now generated its own momentum and credibility&mdash;a functioning legislature in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many come to marvel at our building but, increasingly, people come to watch and listen to the way we do our work. Who would have thought that Westminster would send a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Committee Work of the House, Lord Thurlow, to learn from the Senate's scrutiny of bills process? Thus in Australia, with its narrowly defined constitution and a federal government fixated with overriding local conventions with international treaties, the Australian Senate remains perhaps the last bastion in protecting the rights of the citizens and the states that make up our federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there are definite problems within the bicameral system of legislature, the long-term need for bicameralism far exceeds the often temporary obstacles it may create. The fact remains, however, that in most federal bicameral legislatures the powers invested in the upper house are there by design. They are deliberate and calculated measures to ensure that the legislative process has checks and balances on the often dangerous and easily exploited system that is democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter that caused me a great deal of concern in Senate estimates hearings. As we no longer have the sensible system in which those reports could be properly dealt with in this chamber, I am using this opportunity to express my concerns. They relate to the Australian Securities Commission and its capacity to ensure that its database is accurate and honest. What emerged from the Senate estimates hearings was very disturbing. It became clear that the Australian Securities Commission does not have the resources, the capacity or the desire to ensure that annual returns put in by directors of proprietary companies are accurate. Yet uppermost in the objectives of the Australian Securities Commission is the maintenance of an accurate database about companies for the benefit of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If accuracy is an objective, and if the forms signed by directors of proprietary companies require the directors to sign a declaration that the returns are accurate and honest, it seems absurd that there is no capacity for the Australian Securities Commission to police that and ensure that they are accurate and honest. Many people might say that that does not matter as long as the Australian Securities Commission pursues the big crooks&mdash;the highly publicised so-called `entrepreneurs', who seemed to thrive for a while under the mates system this government operated with WA Inc. and others&mdash;because that is the main job it should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most Australians recognise that there are hundreds of thousands of proprietary companies employing enormous numbers of Australians. In fact, there are more Australians employed in small business than in big business. These proprietary companies occupy an enormous role, as they should, in the Australian environment. We are all aware that there are some proprietary companies involved in the piggery industry. We are well aware of the appalling reporting record of the piggery companies owned by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. These companies breached almost every possible reporting rule of the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;apparently, largely with impunity&mdash;in relation to the accuracy part of the matter. The stories of their lateness are legend. The instances of their failure to put in any returns at all are substantial. If I have time I will deal with the failure by the Australian Securities Commission to ensure that annual returns are filed and that action should be taken when they are not filed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might mention in passing that at the time Mr Keating was the half owner one company failed to put in a return, which was, I would submit, of some substance. It was not for the year in which he was a half owner, but the responsibility for putting in the return was at the time he was a half owner. That return has never been put in. The Australian Securities Commission advised me during Senate estimates hearings that it would not pursue the matter&mdash;which strikes me as absolutely incredible&mdash;on the basis that the company had put in subsequent annual returns and the one in question was historical. However, I think most people will recognise this historical annual return as being of major significance in the context of what appears to have been a totally false subsequent return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, getting back to this question of accuracy of proprietary company annual returns, the failure of the Securities Commission to have this anywhere on its list of priorities is a matter of major concern to me. I acknowledge that the resources of the Securities Commission are stretched in pursuing so many of the former mates of this government&mdash;it is very busy doing so&mdash;but that does not mean that this huge area should be ignored. The extent to which it is ignored is a major problem for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robinson from the Securities Commission responded to my concerns about this in a Senate estimates hearing on 27 May. Concerning the Securities Commission approach, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It starts on the basis that the commercial community in Australia requires accurate information to be available about companies which trade or are in any other way existing in Australia. The accuracy, completeness and accessibility of that database are, we think, an important part of commercial life.</PARA>
<PARA>They are so important that in the proprietary company area basically nothing is being done to ensure that the accuracy and completeness of those records are there. Certainly, the Securities Commission has done an enormous amount about making them accessible. Before the Securities Commission began its very effective campaign on reporting, some companies, including several of those run by Mr Keating's former piggery partner, Mr Constantinidis, had not filed annual returns for up to seven years. This response then prompted me to ask Mr Robinson the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You required the reports to be accurate. What resources, if any, are you putting towards ensuring accuracy in the proprietary end?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robinson responsed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a company chooses to lodge a return which does not have accurate information, in the normal course there is very little opportunity for the ASC to check the accuracy of that information.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a statutory requirement that directors tell the truth; we have a declaration they make that states that the information should be accurate; we have the Securities Commission itself stating that its priorities include the accuracy of its returns; we have Mr Robinson declaring how important it is for the Australian business community and the community at large that these reports be accurate; yet the Securities Commission does not have the capacity to check the accuracy of that information. His justification sounds plausible:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there was any occasion when it was necessary to check that, in other words, if there was a complaint or it was otherwise drawn to our attention that there may be inaccuracies in that database, then obviously that would be a matter that would be followed up.</PARA>
<PARA>I can say this: there is no doubt the ASC did eventually follow up a lot of the points I made about the inaccuracy of these returns, and I am grateful that eventually it did so. Had I not pointed out the false nature of so many of the Prime Minister's piggery companies' accounts, that would not have been done. As Mr Robinson then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are approximately 800,000 companies registered and to check the accuracy of the database of all of those companies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this scheme really relies on the directors of those companies accepting the obligation to report accurately on all of the details which relate to those companies.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, be good boys and tell the truth because we cannot tell whether you are telling the truth or not. From my experience with the Keating piggery companies, I can say that that is a ludicrous premise for the ASC to proceed on, as has been demonstrated. I then asked Mr Robinson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you have no sort of audit function in the proprietary end in the way the Tax Office, for example, has the same sort of honour system, honourable system if you like, about tax returns but with an audit function? You have no such audit function?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robinson said, `No, that is not entirely true.' Through one of the surveillance programs, he said, they were. I then pressed whether that surveillance related to public companies, not proprietary companies. He said that it related to all companies. On further examination, however, it is clear that, effectively, it relates only to public companies. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But that does not deal with, for example, returns where the director declares in a sworn declaration that the contents of the return are accurate. That does not deal with, for example, the key financial data element of that.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robinson conceded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, those are not checked unless there needs to be a more detailed examination as to the affairs of that particular company because there has been a complaint about some part of its activity.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words: `No, there is no spot audit. There is no fear, no risk of a spot audit in the mind of a director who puts in a false return.' As I said, we have seen plenty of them. I have presented plenty of them to this parliament. I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have there been any prosecutions of directors of proprietary companies for making false declarations in proprietary company returns?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robinson responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there have, there would have been only a relatively small number. I cannot give you that information; I am happy to take the question on notice.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 27 May 1994. It must be very difficult for the ASC to establish even whether that was so, because I have still not had any answer. Yet the appropriations to which this matter relates have passed this parliament. This I believe raises some serious questions about whether or not this parliament should agree to appropriations for departments and organisations which are incapable of justifying elements of their expenditure to this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked then whether the Securities Commission had, as a policy proposition, sought to use, for example, a lead case against a company putting in evidently false proprietary company returns in order to give a precedent to the thousands who might well be putting in similar false returns&mdash;in other words, to warn them off. Mr Robinson's responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of any case that would be regarded as that form of precedent at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words: `We do not have spot audits; we have got no way of finding out whether the directors are telling lies or not; and we do not have a system where we have taken anyone to court on the basis of a false statement.' I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What action is taken on habitual breaches that are self-evidently habitual breaches of Corporations Law in respect of either late returns or false returns?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robinson's response was the correct one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of late returns or non-returns the ultimate sanction in one sense is to deregister the company.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen that happen to Mr John Brown's former company, Brown and Hatton Pty Ltd. Mr Robinson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC in any one year deregisters a substantial number of companies for failure to lodge returns or to provide information. For habitually late information it is possible for the ASC under the Corporations Law to seek to have directors of those companies disqualified, if the court was to form the view that the director was deliberately refusing to comply with their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>So, naturally, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has any director been disqualified?</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is not too difficult to get this out of your database, I would be grateful if you would tell me the number of such proprietary company directors who you have sought to have disqualified or the number of instances where you have achieved that objective for things like habitual lateness&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the other ones of false returns. Mr Robinson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will take that on notice.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 27 May. I have had no answer. What is a matter of major concern to me is the fact that a lot of proprietary companies should not have to go through this process anyway. They are not in the business of trading. Often they are really just family companies. They should be excluded from this whole process. There should be a better way of doing it. Companies such as the Prime Minister's piggery companies&mdash;$30 million of assets, huge debts to the Commonwealth Bank, and so on&mdash;are the ones which must report accurately and properly. The Securities Commission appears not to have a proper process for dealing with this huge number of Australian proprietary companies that are under an obligation to tell the truth and yet in relation to which the Securities Commission has neither the resources nor the desire, apparently, to ensure that they have accurate returns. I ask the government to examine this matter, I ask the Securities Commission to examine this matter, and I suggest that something be done about it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have this question to follow the last one because it is clear that the Treasurer's statement on superannuation changes will assist women. It will increase not only the amount of superannuation that women have access to but also the superannuation they can continue to keep claim to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that many part-time and casual workers, most of whom are women, receive superannuation benefits that are small. The problem is also compounded because many of those casual and part-time workers may have more than one superannuation guarantee account as they move from job to job or hold more than one job. The result is that, because of those fees and charges, a number of those small superannuation accounts are eroded to zero.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central elements of the package announced yesterday are: firstly, the use of the Australian Taxation Office for employers who are required to make small and irregular contributions for their employees to hold payments until they reach a ceiling of $1,200; secondly, a transfer protocol to allow the aggregation of small accounts that a person may hold in a number of different superannuation funds; thirdly, the voluntary extension of the tax file number to provide an accurate and simple mechanism to aggregate accounts, to reduce lost accounts, and to simplify fund administration; and, fourthly, to limit the charges applying to members with small balances. This means that women with small accounts&mdash;below $1,000&mdash;can feel confident that their funds will be protected and will not be eroded by fees and charges. It is important to note that these measures will also assist women who already have small accounts. The measures announced by the Treasurer will provide for these accounts to be transferred free of charge to another fund which has member protection policies or to the ATO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that Senator Hill is not celebrating these achievements, particularly on behalf of the women of Australia. Under this government, superannuation coverage for women employed full time has increased from 40 per cent in 1988 to 94 per cent in 1993, and from eight per cent to 46 per cent for those employed part time, largely due to the government's support for award-based superannuation and the superannuation guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to ensuring that women have an equal go was one of the features that emerged from last year's review of the Office of the Status of Women. One of the priority areas for examination under the heading `Income security for women' was superannuation. As a result, the OSW held a seminar that brought together industry, consumers and government policy makers where the problems faced by women were raised. It is interesting that this question of very good news in the superannuation area for women follows Senator Hill's question. He does not seem to want to acknowledge the achievements for women in superannuation. These reforms will go a long way to helping Australian women have access to their superannuation benefits. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Why has the government rejected the introduction of a superannuation savings account which, as well as increasing competition, would mean low administrative costs, not another layer of government bureaucracy, and would give workers greater control over their savings?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do support Senator Faulkner. He is doing an outstanding job on everything he turns his considerable talents to. On the subject of the moratorium clause, the situation is this: the national forest policy statement contains an agreed strategy designed to conserve and manage old growth forests as part of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, as Senator Chamarette well knows. As part of that strategy, governments agreed that, until assessments of forests for conservation values, including old growth values, are completed, forest management strategies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forests that are likely to have high conservation value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly Senator Faulkner's view&mdash;and I believe this is the government's&mdash;that the only prudent way to interpret that moratorium clause is to ensure that old growth forests and wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value should not be logged until assessments are complete in those particular areas. There are difficulties that this could cause, but governments should certainly make every effort to locate alternative supplies.

Mr Jean Obeid arrived in Australia in January 1992 and left in May 1992.

The report to which Senator McKiernan referred is one that provides both a comprehensive historical overview of the history of refugee settlement and an analysis of selection and settlement policies of government. The review goes to weaknesses in the process. Let me say at the outset that Dr Jupp, in addressing those weaknesses, initially does recognise that there have been some important changes in intake and policy since he embarked on his study in 1992. In fact, there have been many recent developments that the report does not adequately take into account. It is important to place those developments on record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1993, I commissioned a high-level departmental task force of settlement services to humanitarian entrants. This has resulted in a number of substantial reforms, many of which were announced in the 1994-95 budget. The provision of some $750,000 under the additional grants scheme, focusing on the special needs of humanitarian program entrants, is important. In terms of Dr Jupp's concerns, extra departmental resources of $625,000 for the coordination and delivery of services for refugees and other humanitarian entrants are also fundamentally important. Those measures will lead to a more planned and effective settlement program, a program which will have as a major objective the better case management of new arrivals under our humanitarian program to ensure that they are referred to, and receive, the services they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those have been some of the initiatives in my portfolio. In the portfolio of health, in the budget the government announced $5.2 million in additional funding over the next four years for a nationwide network of services to survivors of torture and trauma. That is one of the initiatives that Dr Jupp, I am sure, will welcome. As well as that, the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, has decided to do away with the requirement for refugees to have lived in Australia for a set period of time to qualify for pensions. As a consequence of that decision, 7,000 people will benefit this year and close to 2,500 to 3,000 more will benefit in outgoing years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Jupp also refers to the important aspect of employment programs. I am sure that he would have welcomed the initiatives in the Working Nation white paper that are specifically aimed at non-English speaking background job seekers.

But the facts are that the Australian Heritage Commission's advice was sought on this proposal. Since no additional areas of harvesting were proposed by Gunns, as I advised the Senate in answer to a previous question from Senator Bell, the commission indicated that the advice it provided on National Estate values and measures to mitigate impacts of those values in respect of the 1994 Tasmanian woodchip licence was applicable and that a separate referral under section 30 of the act was therefore not required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the fact that advice from the Australian Heritage Commission was sought, part two of Senator Bell's question is now not applicable. The answer to the third part of the question, of whether we have reinterpreted section 30, is no. The answer to the final part of Senator Bell's question is also no. About 40 per cent of the licence amount, that is, 80,000 tonnes, will come from sawmill residues from the company's existing operations. To date, these have been sold to other companies for export. The remainder will come from the residues of low grade logs which will be sawn to extract maximum usable timber. At present, these logs are either chipped entirely or they are simply left on the forest floor to rot. Previously, these logs have been classified as pulp logs. So the answer to the last part of Senator Bell's question is no.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. With more than 35 per cent of Australians living outside Australian capital cities, how can this government justify slashing almost $200 million from road funding in the next financial year? This follows drastic cuts in last year's budget and the failure to renew the black spots program responsible for saving many lives. How can the government justify the cut when it spends less than $1 out of every $10 it collects in fuel excise on funding the upkeep of our roads? I ask: what are the lives of 6 1/2 million people living outside the capital cities worth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hope that Senator Sandy Macdonald could prevail upon his regional government colleagues in the Northern Territory government to convince them that the lives of people living outside metropolitan areas are worth something because they consistently resist all of our attempts to bring in sensible road safety measures that might save a few lives in the Northern Territory, and I regret to say that it is for that reason that the statistics that were just published again a week ago indicate that our situation up in the territory is continuing to worsen while everywhere else in Australia it is getting better. But the current road funding arrangements reflect a heads of government agreement that was reached in 1991 to clearly define and to separate the road responsibilities of Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1994-95 financial year, the government will provide $1.5 billion for road funding to the states and local government. The national highway component of that, all 18,500 kilometres of it that we are responsible for, will take up $820 million of that funding. In addition, $350 million will be provided as untied grants to the states. I might add that it is a matter of record that some of that money in the previous financial year has been diverted by some state governments away from road funding, but that is a decision which, of course, is able to be reached by state governments with these untied funds. Of local road funds, $326 million on top of that will be paid as untied grants to local governments for their roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The base level of road funding for the national highway system is being maintained over the three-year life of the road funding program, and it is the states that have the responsibility to ensure that untied road moneys are spent on roads. The Commonwealth intends to strongly encourage the states to accept this responsibility. The minister for transport has recently announced allocations for the states for road funding in 1994-95, with an emphasis on extra funding for a number of major projects already started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's national highway priorities include, I am pleased to say, Melbourne's western ring-road, the Sydney-Newcastle freeway at Arimba, the Hume Highway, Brisbane's gateway arterial, the Bass Highway in Tasmania&mdash;do not tell me that Tasmania is not part of regional Australia&mdash;Western Australia's Great Eastern Highway and the Victoria Highway in the Northern Territory. The state allocation indicated in the budget papers for national highway funding was simply extrapolations from the 1993-94 funding as no decision had then been taken on the 1994-95 allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, with reference to the black spot funding that was referred to in Senator Macdonald's question&mdash;that is the reason I mentioned the Northern Territory specifically&mdash;that was a one-off, three-year, additional allocation to the states in exchange for agreement to adopt a 10-point program of measures to improve road safety which, I have to say with some satisfaction, it dramatically did. It was always intended for that to be a one-off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that I take no pride in at all as a Territorian is that, despite the fact that the Northern Territory accepted the money, it ratted on its commitment to implement that 10-point program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this point in time it is the only jurisdiction in Australia&mdash;despite the horrific road toll, which is double the national average&mdash;that still has not moved from .08 to .05 blood alcohol, to its eternal shame, despite the statistics.

In that connection he has a predilection in this direction and allows that concern to override his feigned concern about environment to the extent that he has no interest whatever in protecting the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Campbell this day, relating to the awarding of a tender to the Australian Construction Services for the clean-up of the Maralinga atomic test site.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of points that need to be made about this. The Maralinga test site clean-up operation is a complex and dangerous engineering project involving the clean-up after the British nuclear tests. It involves handling one of the most dangerous substances on this earth, plutonium. There are a number of world experts in handling plutonium, some in the United States and some based in the United Kingdom. The job that the Australian Construction Services has been awarded by the minister is for the design and planning for a project which could take quite a few years and cost probably over $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Construction Services was selected from a short list of three tenderers. Each one of the other tenderers involved Australian and some overseas components. As I said in my question to the minister, both of those tenderers could be regarded as amongst the best engineering and nuclear safety consortiums on this planet. One certainly requires that level of expertise to undertake such a complex and dangerous project to return Maralinga to what must be considered a relatively safe site for re-habitation, particularly by the former native inhabitants of that region, the Aboriginal people, and anyone else who wanders across the Maralinga lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a crucial project. The handling of plutonium is a very dangerous pastime. One would expect the best engineering brains in the world to be brought into the project. I reflect on no-one in the ACS&mdash;the Australian Construction Services&mdash;which has been awarded the job. I have raised a number of concerns about the process. Although I am not happy with the way the tenderers were chosen, I had decided to let the issue rest until I read the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 28 June which described the Australian Construction Services under the headline, `Fear-driven ACS riddled with major problems.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It described the ACS as being a parochial, fear-driven autocracy. It described it as suffering from factionalism, and from leadership which was perceived to be weak and aloof. The organisation was said to have a lack of direction. It said that the staff were punch-drunk. It even quoted the minister, Mr Walker, as conceding that the report was extremely critical of the ACS. The final line of the article questioned financial estimates, but it did not say which financial estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the crucial things about the tender for the clean-up of Maralinga is the tendered price. Because the minister informed me at estimates committees that price was a crucial element of selecting the final tenderer, the accuracy of the estimates in financial affairs is, of course, a crucial matter. I specifically asked the minister if he read the report. He chose not to answer that part of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, if I were giving a tender to an organisation to conduct such a complicated and dangerous operation and, a month after giving that contract to Campbell Engineers, Spindler Engineers or someone like that, I read a report about that engineering company, I would call for a copy of that report immediately. I would ask my officers to review that report, and I would ensure that none of the matters within that report went to the technical capabilities of the engineering firm that I had contracted to do the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the minister to suspend ACS's appointment until a review into both the commercial neutrality of ACS's bid and ACS's competencies and organisational strength has been undertaken by the Auditor-General before any more work gets done. The clean-up operation has had to wait for years and years. A review taking another one or two months is not going to hurt Maralinga's clean-up one bit. Indeed, if the current consortium does it without the full faith of the Australian government and the Australian taxpayer in its abilities, the result could be a very dangerous disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's debate on the treatment that Australian children receive had its beginnings in a notice of motion of which I gave notice on 22 June. That notice of motion referred the Senate to a UNICEF report which found that the rate of youth suicide in Australia is now the sixth highest in the industrialised world; and further, that nine per cent of children in Australia are living below the poverty line compared with 1.6 per cent in Sweden. That notice of motion also included the following sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is still one of the few industrialised countries that has not prohibited the physical punishment of children.</PARA>
<PARA>The government agreed to support that motion, with an amendment, but the opposition decided that it could not support it because of the statement of fact that Australia is one of the few industrialised countries that has not prohibited the physical punishment of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Abetz took umbrage at that. I regret that he is unable to be here today because I would like to direct some remarks to him. Apparently, Senator Abetz said publicly that, if administered with love, corporal punishment is okay. I did not know that coalition policy was affected by the statements of one particular senator to that extent. I wonder whether the infliction of physical pain as a means of educating children is now coalition policy. Perhaps Senator Troeth could enlighten us on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that topic it is worth while mentioning that Australia is neglecting to do something about outlawing such treatment of children when article 19.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires governments to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect children from all forms of physical and mental violence and maltreatment. It is quite clear that the deliberate infliction of pain is contrary to this convention and should be banned by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that we are very much behind in this regard. For example, the physical punishment of children in schools was banned in Austria and Finland some 100 years ago. Clearly, we are now in breach of our international obligations. Countries, such as Australia, which have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are, I submit, obliged to protect children from all forms of physical and mental violence. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 1 June, Moira Rayner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most reliable predictors of future violence is past aggression.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the deliberate infliction of pain on young people will not make them more sensitive people, just as torture is not likely to lead to greater empathy with others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Senate to a paper entitled `Corporal punishment in Australia' by Robert Ludbrook of the National Children and Youth Law Centre, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Justice Brennan in two recent High Court decisions has reminded us, it is a "fundamental principle, plain and incontestable" that every person's body is inviolate. He goes on to say `Unless driven by legal imperatives, I would deny to any instrument of the State the power to authorise the invasion of the physical integrity of any person except to save that person's life or to save her from serious bodily harm.'</PARA>
<PARA>Corporal punishment only encourages young people to believe that when someone acts in a way that they do not approve of, recourse to violence is the appropriate response. Children may consider hitting an acceptable way to express anger. As they grow to adulthood they may think it is permissible to hit another adult, such as the driver who cuts them off in traffic, an irritating colleague or a spouse who disagrees with them. And here I should note the incidence of domestic violence in Australia where, once again, we do not have a very enlightening record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other research suggests that, when a parent relies on spanking, the child is left to respond in negative ways. Indeed, children who are spanked often, become overly aggressive towards others. Physical punishment also blocks the opportunity for learning. An American clinical psychologist, Dr Derek Hopson, has found that when a child is hit, the child is responding `mostly to fear and trying to avoid pain rather than trying to learn whatever message or information the parent is trying to transmit.' This just breeds resentment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave that topic because the report from UNICEF concentrates on the other disadvantages that Australian children suffer. Australia is the third worst country in the industrialised world for youth poverty. In Australia, nine per cent of children are living below the poverty line. The comparative figure for Sweden is 1.6 per cent. The report states the perhaps obvious fact that the welfare of children in the developed world can no longer be taken for granted. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today there are many millions of children in economically advanced nations whose quality of life would have to be judged poorer than that of many children in the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA>We must be vigilant because of the possibility that a bad situation in this country could easily become worse. With the most recent budget the Australian Democrats attempted to do something about youth poverty. Amongst others, our budget proposals included: a doubling of the home child care allowance; a doubling of the tax rebate for low income earners; implementation of the green paper proposals to split the unemployment benefit of married couples into two single entitlements; and the introduction of a parenting allowance where one spouse is caring for a child under 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the subject of youth suicide. Youth poverty and alienation have an even darker side; the rate of youth suicide in this country is the sixth highest in the industrialised world. Suicide by teenagers between 15 and 19 has almost doubled in the period from 1970 to 1991. I seek leave to conclude my remarks after Senator Troeth has spoken. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Australia, the report raises concerns about corporate punishment, youth suicide, child health and child poverty. It is interesting to note that the UNICEF report shows that 20 per cent of children in the United States live in poverty. It is important to note that this report rates Australia highly in a number of crucial areas, including its achievements in child survival, child health and child education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to child poverty, the report's findings are based on old data&mdash;in fact, 1980s data. Since that time the government has made significant real increases in the level of social security payments to families with children. Initiatives announced in the Working Nation statement will further assist low income families by reducing unemployment and by the removal of poverty traps, including part-time employment disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that UNICEF has also raised the issue of maternity allowance in the context of practices in other industrialised nations. It is my understanding that the government is presently examining this issue. Most social security clients and low income earners with children now receive payments above the often quoted Henderson poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the rate of youth suicide in Australia, there is presently some disagreement on whether the suicide rate is increasing among our young people or whether the reporting of such suicides is more accurate. Irrespective of this debate, the government is concerned at the suicide rate of young Australians and is acting to prevent suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the National Health and Medical Research Council established a working party on suicide prevention. That working party is developing a national strategy for suicide prevention. Such a strategy is being developed in consultation with government and non-government organisations, health professionals, academics, consumer organisations and the general public. We all must recognise that youth suicide is a complex issue. In many cases there are contributing factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has initiated reforms in the mental health sector&mdash;the development of a national policy on child and youth health which includes the issue of youth suicide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abuse of Australia's children cannot be tolerated and, as honourable senators are aware, the recent federal budget provided funding of $12 million to implement the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect, which aims to create an environment which supports families and communities and helps them to meet their responsibilities to care for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Family Studies is undertaking an examination of the Commonwealth's role and responsibilities in relation to the prevention of child abuse and neglect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not prepared to rest on its laurels with regard to the wellbeing of children and is developing an agenda for families which will include further initiatives to further address the needs of families with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the concerns raised in the report about corporal punishment. The government is clear on this issue&mdash;the conduct of discipline by schools is a matter for state governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government does not accept the UNICEF conclusion that the absence of a blanket prohibition on corporal punishment of children breaches our commitment to the convention. The Commonwealth is proud of its human rights record and believes it is important that we are able to withstand international scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Child Protection Council has commissioned a discussion paper on the legal aspects of the physical punishment of children. This paper will be used to promote community debate on this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Spindler points out, the UNICEF report also ranks Australia sixth highest amongst industrialised nations in our youth suicide rate in children aged between 15 and 19. It is important to note that these unfortunate people who commit suicide simply decide that life is no longer worth living. One wonders what factors of living in Australia in 1994 make them take this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of main causes have been suggested as responsible for youth suicide. Among these are employment, financial stress, family breakdown and drug and alcohol abuse. Unlike the Australian Democrats, the coalition has concrete reasons for believing that there should be more action by government and that there is a real need for government to take urgent action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the Victorian coroner, Mr Hal Hallenstein, found that young male suicide rates were higher in areas of high unemployment. For example, in the non-metropolitan areas of Melbourne, both unemployment and male suicide rates were higher than in other areas. The western non-metropolitan area had the highest unemployment rate among 15- to 19-year-old males&mdash;February 1994 figures&mdash;at 15.2 per cent and the highest suicide rate at 26.9 per cent per 100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pain of the recession that we had to have has been borne disproportionately by our youth. High unemployment and financial stresses place great strain on families and family breakdown has the potential for long lasting detrimental effects on children and teenagers. The high level of youth suicide is undoubtedly correlated to all these additional stresses endured by our youth in the wake of the government's failed economic policies. Youth workers themselves have said that they fear `widespread youth unemployment has bred a generation of cynics and caused social and economic problems that will haunt the nation for decades.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment figures for May this year show that unemployment among 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work increased from 32.2 per cent to 32.8 per cent during May. So much for the recovery. According to the ABS figures, in the three months to February 1994 some regions of Australia had more than 50 per cent of their youth population out of work. Fifty-four per cent of north Melbourne teenagers were unemployed and the Richmond-Tweed Heads region on the north coast of New South Wales also had an unemployment rate of 52 per cent. Mr Freeland, senior lecturer in social work and social policy at the University of Sydney, recently said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder our young people are cynical. They are very familiar with the litany of broken promises under Labor. Our youth know not to expect anything from this government. Indeed, the only thing 32.8 per cent of them have received is a place on the dole queue. The white paper will not change that. All it will do is mask the real unemployment figures by shuffling people into training programs. There are no real job creation initiatives in the white paper and nothing to realistically tackle the biggest problem facing today's youth. </PARA>

On 14 April 1994, Mr Burdekin, the author, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has totally failed many of its young people . . . We now have over 700,000 children living in homes in which no one has an income.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for five years of Labor government. He described as `a disgrace' one of the inquiry's findings that every young man prostituting himself on the wall in Darlinghurst in Sydney had been a ward of the state. Mr Burdekin said that this was because all too frequently the state was flick-passing young people to crisis refuges which lacked the capacity, training and professional backup to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard of many instances where children leave home and, for a variety of reasons, no attempt is made to see whether reconciliation is possible. I refer to a tragic case in Queensland where a young girl died while receiving the federal government's youth homeless allowance. The girl died after taking drugs and drowning as a result of being under the influence of drugs bought with the money. A doctor giving evidence at the inquest into the girl's death said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departmental guidelines required a child's reason for him or her leaving home to be verified, but this was not done in many cases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've had a number of reports of people who've gone into the department and been given the youth homeless allowance without verification of their claims and who have worried their parents frantic.</PARA>
<PARA>The girl's mother said she had:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . pleaded with a number of departments for assistance in guiding her daughter through some difficult periods in their lives but without success.</PARA>
<PARA>She said `When Peita'&mdash;her daughter&mdash;`was given this money, I lost control of her.' The treatment needs to be given before children leave home, not after they leave home and as an inducement to their leaving home. This case, and others like it, is an example of the Labor Party's social agenda that does not account for individual consideration&mdash;in this instance, with a devastating outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by noting another report which relates directly to UNICEF's appalling figures of the number of Australian children living in poverty. The mortality rate of Aboriginal babies is four times the national average. The editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Health 1994</EMPHASIS>, Dr John Donovan, said that without the elimination of socioeconomic factors such as unemployment and poor housing, `the burden of disease on Aborigines would remain.' The need for government to address its priorities and take urgent action in this area is imperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already shown that it is not committed to the goal of producing real employment opportunities for young people. The statistics and the recent increase in youth unemployment are testimony to this. Conventions, such as those mentioned by Senator Denman, and money, as mentioned by many of the government's economic spokesmen, are no use. We need real solutions. Young people in Australia know that the Australian government offers them no future and it is a shame that so many young Australians have to live with that knowledge. </PARA>

The government is seriously concerned that the public debate on this issue remains ill-informed. Public confidence in the government's policies and programs is being undermined by people who have a responsibility to foster informed debate. We have sought to keep the debate on this matter at the policy level, and to avoid discussing the particulars of the case. Unfortunately, individual cases are now being dragged through the print media and discussed on radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken legal advice. We understand that it would not infringe the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act if, on behalf of the government, I put certain personal information on the record to ensure that the public has accurate information about the matters of public interest. The current case concerns Peita Dalley who applied for, and was granted, the youth homeless allowance. As an example of the sort of irresponsible press coverage that this matter received, I will quote Rod Henshaw on Radio 4BC, who said this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well the way things stand right now, youngsters can front up to social security, bad mouth their home and their parents and presto, they qualify for a homeless allowance.

<PARA>While I do so reluctantly, I will respond on behalf of the government to the question by quoting from the department's report to the coroner, a copy of which has been provided to  me. It states that the circumstances of the recommendations for grant were recorded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peita presented to the interview with her sister and detailed a history of conflict in the family home. This included many instances of both verbal and physical abuse. She was clearly distressed and reported that she had been evicted from the family home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peita advised the social worker, that the Department of Family Services and the Police Child Protection Unit could verify her circumstances and authorise the Department to contact them on her behalf. The police and DFS reportedly first became involved with the family following a suicide attempt several months previously in which Peita took an overdose of medication in response to unbearable stress and conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peita specifically requested in writing, that her step-father not be contacted as she feared retaliation if he was aware that she had reported her home circumstances to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social worker subsequently phoned the Child Protection Unit (Detective Warren Riley) and the Department of Family Services (Megan Crawford) to verify Peita's home circumstances. Both officers reported concerns about the use of physical tactics to resolve family issues and commented on the assessed level of family dysfunction. The child care officer from DFS concluded that it was not reasonable for Peita to continue to live at home given the long history of unresolved domestic disharmony and the impact of this on her well-being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of collaborating information provided by reliable third parties, supporting statements from the client herself, and the professional social work assessment of the effect of the family environment on the physical and emotional well-being of the youth the social worker recommended payment of the Youth Homeless Allowance.

<PARA>This is the first of several requests that the Australian Democrats will be moving on the women's pension age changes. We are trying to do what the Australian Labor Party should have done before introducing a change as radical as this&mdash;that is, open up debate on some alternative options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By simply grabbing a piece of what was the Fightback document of the Liberal Party at the last election, the Labor Party has caught many women by surprise. Many women do not realise that they may have to wait as long as an extra five years to access the pension. All women aged 45 years or under will not be able to access it until they are 65. Women between the ages of 46 and 59 will have that pension age increased slowly, step by step, incrementally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is at a time when we can see from the statistics that there has been no improvement in the ability of women to catch up with men as far as average weekly earnings are concerned. Senator Kernot and I have raised this issue with Senator Crowley in this place at question time over the last month. We were concerned about the most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show that average male earnings have increased by 2.3 per cent to the year ending February 1994, while average female earnings have gone up by only 1.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We finally got a response from Senator Crowley that basically went back to some other statistics. She decided that she would prefer those statistics to the ones we were using. Whatever time frame the minister likes to choose&mdash;and the one she ended up with was between November 1991 and February 1994&mdash;to argue on, it is the overall trend of the last 10 years that really matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the trend from February 1993 to February 1994, we find there is a very different picture. That picture shows that women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings declined quite dramatically from December 1983 to September 1986; picked up again to September 1987; declined to September 1989; peaked in December 1991; and have been declining ever since to the point where, indeed by February this year, they were almost back to where we women started from in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, over the last 10 years women have made virtually no progress towards equal pay with men at all. Perhaps what we should do is ask the minister a series of questions relating to equal pay for women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important that we do remember that it will not be fully introduced for another 20 years. It is also true, as Senator Kernot says, that women of that age will be having to wait another six months. That introduction is phased in very gently. But, as I have said on a number of occasions, it is a matter of balance. I do not know when those achievements will be reached, but what I do know is that they will not be without a commitment by this government to equal pay for work of equal value in the changes that have just been introduced by Minister Brereton in industrial relations, which changes I think go some considerable way to assisting equal or improved status for women in the workplace. It also fits with other policies of increased tertiary education and training opportunities for women. All of that is a process that is on the go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not find the Democrats' arguments persuasive. As I said to Senator Kernot the other day in relation to the Democrats' comment in the second reading debate, that one option might be to phase this in over 40 years because that would allow a longer lead time for opportunities, statistics and, I suppose, the real world to improve for women. If we had asked 10 years ago whether we expected women to have the status that they have now, particularly in relation to their economic status, we probably would not have got that right either. I think we have to acknowledge that there has been a dramatic improvement. The fact that we are still far short of perfection I do not believe means that we should take the understanding that, because we have not got it completed or that we are only on the way, we should not still set clear goals for where we want to be and what direction we are taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government judges that a 20-year lead time for the movement of the pension age for women from 60 to 65 is a very good balance and is very generous. It is certainly twice the lead time that the opposition was proposing for that change. Given that most policies of the federal government do not get thought of in terms of a 20-year lead time, I think it is extraordinary that we should be aiming to put in place a 20-year lead time for that kind of phased in introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that, while it may not be in this legislation, the government remains committed to projects, programs and policies to keep on keeping on with the improvement of the status of women in those other parameters. We touched on today some of the improvements in superannuation. Of course there is more to be done, and of course that is the case with equal pay for work of equal value. Of course there is a concern to monitor that women are not being disadvantaged under enterprise agreements. Of course there are all of these things, but it is a matter of moving those things on a number of planes at one time and, in keeping with that, recognising our encouragement for women to be able to stay longer in the work force, which is de facto what a later pension age does. It is very important that we keep in mind that comparing today's statistics with what will be the case for women in 20 years time means we could be skewering the equation. </PARA>

Some women do like part-time jobs, particularly during some time in their lives. But none of that stops us being committed to continuing to improve access to superannuation, access to employment, access to training and access to better paying jobs, which is one of the main thrusts behind our affirmative action legislation. All of that is happening. Not one of the things stands by itself. It does not make for a fair comparison.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees this afternoon and also in her speech in the second reading debate said that the first mention of this concept of increasing the pension age for women was first mooted before the last election in the coalition's Fightback document. That is actually totally wrong. It is right that this concept was mentioned and talked about. In fact, we were very right in telling the Australian public that that is what we intended to do. We were up-front and told people that we were going to increase the pension age for women. We were honest. We did not win on the basis of that honesty, but at least I can lie straight in bed at night in knowing that we told the Australian public what we intended to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government in fact hid its intention. It not only promised things but failed to tell people what it was going to do. One of the things it was going to do was increase the pension age for women. That is where this government has fallen down. That is the area in which we take issue with this government: that it hoodwinked the Australian public, in particular Australian women. The government failed to tell them beforehand. That is an incredible situation. The government should be held accountable for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that and the fact that we were planning to increase the pension age for women, we are not of a mind to support the Democrats' request that their amendments be agreed to. First of all, I refer to their first amendment, which seeks to lower the pension age for men. Because they have this problem that they have to come up with the concept of equality between men and women, one way around it is to lower the pension age for men. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear what Senator Lees said, but her argument is aimed at lowering the pension age. I thought that I would ask the Department of Social Security how much that would cost the Australian public. The answer I received was that if we were to lower the pension age for men to 60 years in 1994-95 it would cost $540 million; in 1995-96, $605 million; in 1996-97 it would cost $635 million; and in 1997-98, $670 million. I do not see that as the most sensible way in which to use taxpayers' money to solve the problem posed by Senator Lees. The coalition is not of a mind to support that proposal</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Lees pointed out that this was the first time this idea had been mooted, I said she was wrong. In 1985 the New South Wales Equal Opportunity Tribunal ruled against the enforcement by employers of different retirement ages for men and women by employers. In 1986 a report by the Human Rights Commission supported a uniform qualifying pension age for men and women. In 1988 a committee of this Senate, the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, tabled a report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Support for the Retired and Aged: Agenda for Reform</EMPHASIS>. The report recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The age of eligibility for the age pension for women be increased from 60 to 65 years, thereby establishing a common age of pension entitlement for both men and women and that this change be phased in over a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA>Members on both sides of the House expressed some concern at such a proposition. Certainly the suggestion has not just suddenly popped out of Fightback, but has been around for some time and has been debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that, with the difference in pension ages between men and women as more and more women move into the work force, it is possible that retirement ages could be linked with pension eligibility in the workplace. If there is downsizing in an organisation, somebody who is very clever could manoeuvre the situation so that the woman loses her job, with the excuse that she could get the pension, with the male being kept on because he has not reached pensionable age. That is a problem and one reason why it is not a good idea to have a different retirement age as between males and females. I can see why it is suggested that the retirement age for men should be reduced to 60. However, I think that is not tenable or affordable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second request from the Democrats is that, if the first request is lost, there should be a delay in the start-up date by 10 years beginning in the year 2004. I regard that as not a sensible suggestion and I agree with Senator Crowley on that score. I believe that a 20-year lead time is extraordinary in terms of government policy and planning. The third request extends the phase-in period to 40 years. Well, I believe that is not acceptable and the coalition will not support that request. Indeed, we will not be supporting any of the requests in this area because we believe a 20-year phase-in period is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask the government to monitor the phasing-in period, especially for those women who would otherwise have qualified for an age pension but who find themselves unemployed. We do not wish to see them disadvantaged as a result of this change. We believe they should be eligible for some alternative form of income support, such as partner allowance or widow's allowance. If the conditions that brought about the introduction of the mature age allowance persist&mdash;that is, the massive unemployment that has occurred as a result of the recession we had to have as a result of Mr Keating's policies&mdash;and if the unemployment level is maintained, we believe that a mature age allowance or similar safety net be considered. In other words, there should be a safety net to cover that interim period in the case of people who at 60 or 60 1/2 suddenly find themselves unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government will give an assurance that there will be close monitoring of the transition phase, the coalition will be supporting the government amendment rather than the Democrats' requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply to a number of points that were raised by Senator Patterson. She referred to my comment that the first time that we heard about the raising of the women's pension to age 65 was in Fightback. I was specifically looking at any public discussion whatsoever. I am aware of reports. Indeed, I am also aware that the women's pension age has been raised in a couple of countries overseas. But I would point out that in this country we have not had a broad public debate. We have not looked at why we are taking this step for any other reason than economic expediency on the part of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson highlighted the fact that it would be expensive if we were to bring the men's pension age down. Looking at its logic of how men and women are now supposedly equal in status, we are simply offering the government another option, another way out, rather than putting so many women at risk on a considerably lower income. If they are to get the mature age allowance, they are looking at their being at least $12 a week worse off as well as having lower associated benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving our first request, we are saying that, if the government is only concerned about equity and equality and if it is to continue to insist that somehow or other men and women have this equal opportunity, surely there is a fairer way to look at this problem. I say that in view of the fact that unemployment is as high as it is, and bearing in mind the need for a mature age allowance for those men who in their early 60s are unable to enter the work force or, having lost their jobs, are unable to get back into it. Indeed, many of those jobs have disappeared. The mature age allowance was brought in with a sunset clause, which is now only two years away. If we look at what is happening in the Australian economy, I imagine we will see both men and women through to the year 2000 still on that mature age allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to get back to some other presumptions and to examine the question of equity. The Democrats will continue to argue that on plain equity grounds it is not the time to look at changing the eligibility rate for women. I stress that Senator Crowley is missing my point that in 10 years we have seen no gains in average weekly earnings. What documentary evidence exists to prove that in 20 years suddenly there will be equity in pay? That relates back directly to superannuation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at a recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that men between the ages of 45 and 55 are 40 per cent more likely to be covered by superannuation than are women. I think that is the age group that we are discussing today. Certainly men have far greater access to superannuation than do women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the request, if the concern is only about equity, one other way of achieving it is to drop the age of pension for men to 60. There are other options which the government has not discussed in this debate. There is the option that would mean both sexes retiring at age 62 or indeed at age 63. However, the government has chosen the option that it believes will save the most money. The people who will now carry that financial burden are women between the ages of 60 and 64. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some brief comments on what has been said in this discussion. I would point out that I was a member of the committee that dealt with community services and welfare under the chairmanship of the then Senator Elstob. That committee looked at the subject of retirement income in the 1980s. Senator Lees may be interested to know that the age of eligibility for pension was extensively canvassed. All the issues dealt with by Senator Lees in this debate were at that time examined, costed and argued about. I am not sure when that committee issued its report; I believe it was in the mid-1980s. Certainly it is not a new subject and has not just been brought on to the agenda without consideration or discussion. It has been discussed at considerable length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the honourable senator's point about the conditions and the equality of women. One could say that maybe I should not have argued about women's earnings over 10 years. I make the point&mdash;and I think the honourable senator nodded agreement&mdash;that many more women have entered the work force in the last 10 years. I do not have with me the graph which shows this but we have to be a bit cautious about the figures and data in respect of movements in earnings. The graph compares women's wages in general from 1960 until now and it shows that there has been a steady increase&mdash;a quite dramatic increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that we will have to do something more particular and specific apart from just letting those things happen. It may well be that we will have to wait and see what the position will be when the figures reflect the higher earnings of women with better education as a result of affirmative action. I agree that there are still things to be won for women. But we are talking about the status of women now and about the 65 years age pension in 20 years time. I think the issues and points raised by honourable senators have been extensively canvassed to this point and that there is not much more that can be said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very serious matter indeed. It is a matter that will have an enormous impact on women. It seems to me that the government's definition of `equality' in this instance is to take away from women an advantage that they now have. If that is what equality towards women is all about, I think the government should have another think. It is odd that the government, in trying to promote the interests of women, is seeking to take away from them the advantage that they have so that they will be equal to males. That is a nonsense anyhow because so many women are not in the paid work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has been talking about the paid work force, and I will come back to that in a moment. But what the government is doing here is denying to mothers who have been in full-time, or predominantly full-time, care of children their right to a pension at age 60. The government is going to tell them to wait another five years for their pension. That is a disgrace. I would hope that members of the Australian Labor Party will come in here and express themselves about this type of anti-female approach that is being taken by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the committee that the trade union movement is diametrically opposed to this proposition. Indeed, the ACTU executive council stated at its meeting on 8-10 March in Melbourne that the ACTU should make further representations to the government expressing concern over the proposals to raise the age eligibility for women to receive the age pension from 60 to 65 years of age. That view is held very strongly by a large number of other people&mdash;a large number of unions and a large number of organisations that represent women workers. It is a retrograde step. One organisation with a predominantly female membership wrote to me and said that this is a retrograde step and will cause much financial and physical hardship to many thousands of hardworking women.

The minister previously said, `We want to encourage women to stay in the paid work force; that is what the extension of the pension age from 60 to 65 will mean.' Where does choice come into this? Obviously, this will force many women who might otherwise choose to retire at age 60 to stay in the paid work force until 65 years of age. What will that do to employment? The government has a so-called plan to reduce unemployment. It is an odd government that would put further pressure on the labour market by forcing women to stay in the paid work force for another five years, thus denying their own daughters the opportunity of getting into the paid work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is crazy. That is absolutely stark raving mad. If the government is looking at the employment problem, it really has to look at a number of situations. It needs not only to look at creating jobs, enhancing the economy and the fiscal measures that might be taken; it really must also look at the constitution of the paid work force. It has to see who in the paid work force has more socially desirable reasons to come out of the paid work force; and has to see who has the desire to do so. It has to accommodate those people. With this legislation, the government is going the other way: it is forcing women who would otherwise retire at age 60 to stay for another five years, thus denying other women the opportunity to come into the paid work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to pick up on that point. The minister is suggesting there that somehow we are talking about compulsory retirement. We are not. Indeed, as Senator Patterson said earlier today, she knows of someone in her 80s who is enjoying still being in the work force. We are talking about women who do not have the opportunities that we have, for example, to accrue super and who do not have  employment and who will be forced, instead of having the relative security of the pension, to exist on some other form of allowance that is going to be at least $12 a week less. We are not talking about women now being forced out of the work force at 60. Indeed, in most states, we have legislation that prevents them from being forced out of the work force due to age at any time. We are talking about opportunity, particularly for those women who have not had the work chances that we have had and the chances to accrue any sort of super.</PARA></TALK.START>

What the government wants to do will particularly impact on women in low paid jobs, women who, as Senator Harradine has said, have chosen to stay home and look after children and, therefore, have accrued no super whatsoever. It will impact particularly on women from non-English speaking backgrounds who tend to be concentrated in the low paid, manual end of the work force. Indeed, I think Senator Cook acknowledged that today in question time when he said women are `streamed into low paid jobs'.

They have that now. In most states now, women can stay in the work force for as long as they like. If there is a problem with federal anti-discrimination legislation for women of any particular age, perhaps the government should look at other legislative measures to make sure that women are not forced out of the work force at any particular age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regard it as a great honour to rise this afternoon to deliver my first speech as a senator for New South Wales. Indeed, there can be few greater privileges than to represent one's party and the people of this great nation in the federal parliament. I am particularly pleased that members of my family, my wife's family and friends have been able to attend this afternoon. My dear mother has often reminded me that as a child I made so much noise that people invariably said, `He'll end up a politician.' They were proved correct, but I hope for the wrong reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, Mr President, I do wish to place firmly on the record the debt that I owe to my parents, who instilled in me, my brothers and sister from an early age a commitment to the Labor Party and to social justice. As I grew up, I saw them fight the good fight in the cause of Labor. They never gave up, they never lost the faith, even in those wilderness years between 1949 and 1972. Like so many parents of that generation immediately following the war, they worked hard with a fierce determination to provide their children with the opportunities for an education and for a secure future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1950s, my father was a member of the Cronulla branch of the ALP. Indeed, at one stage, when he was branch secretary, there was a budding politician named Gough Whitlam as his assistant secretary. In 1955, he narrowly missed out on preselection for the seat of Hughes and, therefore, the opportunity to serve as a member of the federal parliament. I think that is what initially inspired me to pursue a political career. I know that any success that I may have had to date is as much an achievement for him as it may be for myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also indebted to my many friends and colleagues in the Labor Party, the trade union movement and in the federal and New South Wales parliaments who have given me great support and shown great confidence in me. In this regard, I particularly wish to record my thanks to a close friend, John Della Bosca, General Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I was appointed to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the retirement of Senator Graham Richardson. I think it is most appropriate to describe my appointment as following Graham Richardson, because Graham is a person whom nobody could ever pretend to replace. Much has already been said in this chamber, particularly on the night of his retirement, about Graham Richardson's political career. Graham's roles as party secretary, as a political strategist and as factional leader have already been well covered. But I want to pay tribute to Graham for his tremendous contribution to the policies and decisions which have shaped Australia since the election of the Hawke government and, subsequently, the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his parliamentary career, Graham served as minister for portfolios as diverse as the environment, the arts, sport, tourism, territories, social security, transport, communications, and health&mdash;a huge range indeed in a short space of time. But Graham had the intellect and the capacity and, when needed, the political courage to pursue objectives and to achieve change in areas that will be of lasting benefit to this nation. Graham was particularly able to stimulate public interest in important issues like the environment and Aboriginal health through his exceptional communication skills. He is well equipped for his new career in journalism and the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, whilst I appreciate that in a first speech one is expected to show a generosity of spirit, I cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the recent vicious personal attacks on and attempted character assassination of Graham Richardson, now a private citizen. I recently took the opportunity to view the video and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of Graham's valedictory speech. It is interesting to recall part of what he said that night. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this chamber continues to descend into a chamber where assassination of character is the order of the day, it will never ever live up to the promise that it holds. I hope it does not do that. I hope it can learn that there are other ways.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will not attack a senator's character. I drew the line at that a long time ago, although I cannot say the same for what some have said of me.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who have sought to attack Graham Richardson's character under the protection of parliament ultimately will not even amount to footnotes in the history of this nation when one compares their contribution with his. I believe it is appropriate now, given this most recent experience, that we find the means to ensure that private citizens and their families are protected from suffering such malicious character assassination. For it is truly a misnomer to call this a privilege of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to my appointment to the Senate I was privileged to work for 18 years for the Australian Workers Union&mdash;an organisation dedicated to the protection of working people. Indeed, I had the honour to be the General Secretary of the AWU for the past three years. The AWU is one of Australia's great unions. Its history is inextricably linked with that of the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, with the development of the Australian nation. We count amongst our forebears such great Australians as Henry Lawson and Mary Gilmore. In the early years of this century, through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worker</EMPHASIS> newspaper, they gave expression to the development of Australia's national identity. Such calls are once again being taken up as we move inevitably towards a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWU has particularly sought to represent workers in rural and remote regions of Australia&mdash;the shearers, the miners, those who have produced so much of Australia's export wealth. I would like to thank all the officials, staff and members for their comradeship and dedication over many years. I would particularly like to mention two people, Gary Johnston and Wendy Pymont, who became close friends during my years in the union. Gary Johnston, along with Graham Richardson, helped me get started in the trade union movement in the early 1970s. Wendy Pymont has given 33 years service to the AWU and has been private secretary to six AWU general secretaries. That takes a lot of commitment and a huge amount of patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement is an essential part of Australia's democratic society. I will always rise to defend it against the unjustified attacks that are often levelled at trade unions in this country by those who merely seek scapegoats for problems that the nation may face from time to time. In recent years, sections of conservative politics, particularly the New Right, have mounted a campaign to destroy the trade union movement, to undermine our system of industrial awards and the protection of workers' rights. In my years with the AWU I encountered many, many instances where workers had no-one to turn to but their union. I can recall on many occasions receiving phone calls from distraught members and non-members who had just received the news that they were being sacked. In many cases this was after a lifetime of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have endless debates about individualism versus collectivism, but such arguments count for naught in situations like these because, despite all the rhetoric, an individual worker, without access to the resources of a representative organisation, is effectively left defenceless. The existence of a free, democratic and viable trade union movement is essential to any democracy. It is essential to ensuring that people's rights and standards of living are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever dictatorships, either left or right, come to power, the first groups to be repressed are the trade unions, the churches and the political parties. This is because they are the vehicles which give public expression to the beliefs and aspirations of the people. In recent years we have witnessed trade unionism playing a leading role in achieving democracy and freedom. The leadership of Solidarity in Poland in eastern Europe and COSATU in South Africa are vivid illustrations of the fundamental importance of organised labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The struggle still goes on in a number of other countries where trade union leaders and members are still being imprisoned, tortured and even executed because of their activities. Unfortunately, there is at times a blatant double standard by some in this country who champion the cause of freedom and democracy overseas but attack trade unions in Australia as if they were the cause of all the ills of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the trade union movement has been at the forefront of the challenge to restructure the Australian economy to enable us to compete internationally. It has adopted and promoted change in many areas, particularly with respect to wage fixation, education, training, employment opportunities, social welfare and retirement incomes. Under the successful accord with the Australian government since 1983 we have seen dramatic change take place and significant social advances made over these last 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantial increase in school retention levels, the establishment of Medicare, the family allowance supplement, the move to enterprise bargaining, the reduction in personal income tax rates, the reduction in industrial disputation to its lowest level in 30 years, the introduction of industry-based award superannuation, the lowest level of inflation since the early 1960s&mdash;all of these and many other achievements have occurred through the accord. Substantial sections of Australia's key industries have been restructured to make them more efficient, productive and internationally competitive. In many cases these changes are being brought about through joint efforts with enlightened employers and business groups who have recognised the value of the cooperative rather than the confrontationist approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased at the successful introduction of award superannuation which, for the first time, has given many thousands of workers an opportunity to build savings for their retirement. Like many other overdue social improvements such as child care, parental leave and equal pay, award superannuation was bitterly opposed at the outset by many employer groups. This was particularly the case for rural employees who are invariably itinerant workers on low incomes with very little employment security. I recall that after much argument we successfully achieved this benefit for rural workers, notwithstanding the opposition from a leading New Right barrister in Victoria, who shall remain nameless, but who has since embarked upon a political career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sorts of accusations have been levelled at the union movement in its campaign to promote superannuation. But look at the results! Since 1983 accumulated superannuation funds have grown from $23 billion to almost $200 billion. They have been projected to reach $600 billion by the year 2000. The percentage of people in the work force covered by a superannuation scheme has increased from 45 per cent in 1982 to over 80 per cent in 1993. The number of people and the level of contributions will continue to grow in future years, thereby alleviating demands upon the social security system. These assets will also provide a substantial opportunity for increased investment in Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, nevertheless, one area which needs to be addressed, and that is the difficulty encountered by low income earners whose superannuation contributions are being whittled away by high fees and management charges. This is a major concern for itinerant and casual workers in such areas as the rural sector, and it is a particular concern for women in the work force. Mr President, I was therefore very pleased to read the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that was made yesterday in which he announced measures to rectify these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I was born and raised in the city of Sydney, my years in the AWU brought home to me the importance of rural and regional Australia. Too often those of us who live in urban Australia forget just how important our rural and resource sectors still are to our economic wellbeing. Exports of all primary products represent approximately 61 per cent of total export income. Of this figure, minerals and fuels account for 32 per cent whilst rural exports account for 29 per cent. Over 400,000 people derive their livelihood directly from the rural sector. Whilst, historically, rural statistics show declining trends, it is pleasing to note the positive predictions for an improvement in the rural sector contained in the recent ABARE agricultural overview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this government has recognised, there are tremendous opportunities to capitalise on our natural assets, particularly through downstream processing of our raw materials. One such industry is the food industry where we can be innovative and can deliver high quality, safe food products to an expanding Asian market. The food processing industry is our largest manufacturing industry with a gross product of $8.5 billion, employing some 170,000 people. Exports of high value added products are currently worth $2.3 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's agri-food industry strategy is providing opportunities for real growth in exports and employment, and consequently improvement in our balance of payments. It builds upon the excellent results already achieved in international trade through the Cairns Group and through the recent GATT negotiations in which the Australian government played such a leading part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest challenge facing this nation today is to reduce unemployment. It is a challenge which all sections of the community must take up. In tackling unemployment, we have to recognise that we face a vastly different world from that which existed when we could boast of long periods of full employment. No longer can we simply depend upon high commodity prices and guaranteed markets for our raw materials. Technological change occurs so rapidly that today's computer is virtually obsolete tomorrow. The days when industries could slumber along behind protective barriers are over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has created the framework for increasing employment. We have economic growth. We have low inflation. We have restructured industry and established a climate for increased investment. These foundations have been built upon in the recent white paper on employment and growth. I particularly welcome those aspects of the white paper which focus on increasing opportunities for the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I learned in the union movement is that unemployment is not merely some economic indicator; rather, we are dealing with real people and real families who expect nothing more than the opportunity to work and to obtain a job with dignity. The white paper deals with the effects of unemployment both in terms of the individual immediately affected and also the wider social cost involved. Through the provision of training, skill development and jobsearch assistance the focus is directed at assisting the individual, particularly the long-term unemployed. It also removes restrictions on part-time work within the social security system and it further recognises the important role of parents caring for young children through the parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These, and the other measures to promote regional development, are what distinguish this government's approach from the alternative proposals of simply reducing wages and working conditions. The opportunities are there in the white paper for business to take up the challenge and increase its investment in Australian industry and in the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my first speech, Mr President, I wish to record my special thanks to my wife Jan, and to my children Simon, Martin and Jeremy. I am fortunate to have their love, their support and, above all, their patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, on 10 May this year I was appointed to the Senate by a joint sitting of the New South Wales Parliament. Later that evening, as I drove to Canberra with my family, I listened on the car radio to the inaugural address of Nelson Mandela, the first truly democratically elected president of South Africa.

She is told, under this legislation, that she has to work another two years on top of the five years.

In the end, Senator Harradine is arguing against a policy decision taken by this government to make this decision now. It is not as though the government has done this out of the blue. As I said, a lot of work has gone into this and there has been a lot of public discussion. I was a member of the retirement income committee which canvassed this very extensively during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we do have to admit that the world is changing for women. We cannot be absolute on whether the world is changing for all women; but I would agree with Senator Lees that there will certainly be some women who will not be in a position to take full advantage of an opportunity to stay in employment, however, increasing numbers of women are doing so. Regardless of whether we say women are allowed to continue working after they reach 60&mdash;and they may be able to do so&mdash;in the minds of most people in this society 60 is the retirement age for women and 65 for men. We know that is not an absolute but it is a fairly good guide and indicator. </PARA>

It is also true that, if people find themselves in difficulty, there will be payments to ensure that they are not dramatically economically disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that as women are becoming employed many of them are preferring to stay employed longer because they see the benefits to their superannuation. It may be modest, but it is better to have a few more years in employment than not. I think it is a matter of being reasonable about this. We can argue it at greater length, but in the end it is a policy decision taken by government on balance, holding its reforms in superannuation, industrial relations, education and so on as a package, or a picture, if you like, of society, including the women in that society. </PARA>

Yes, very closely, of course, because it is a question of having the balance and the data right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get rid of all of that. That is a furphy. I cannot believe that the government is now suggesting that that is the reason it has put this in. It is a crass attempt to save a few bob; that is what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to say that this is to ensure that women can work after they reach the age of 60.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need to broaden the choices for people, and that is what we have been doing. I gave an example of a woman who is still working and she is 55 years of age. She has only five years to go. She wants to retire at 60; she has planned it. With this legislation, the government is telling her to work another two years before she is eligible for the pension. That is against all concepts of freedom of choice. It is certainly against all my instincts of trade unionism. As I said before, if somebody were to say that in order to get long service leave people had to work another two years when they thought they had to work only five years&mdash;in other words, they had to work seven years&mdash;that would create a riot. There would be a strike in some of the establishments that I know of, and quite rightly, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that she could not answer the questions that I asked. She could give a ballpark figure of how many women in Australia are aged 55, but she said that she could not break that up into how many are working and how many will be eligible for a pension when they reach 60. She then went on to give the amount that the government will save because women are not going to take up the pension because of this legislation. If she can tell us what the government thinks it is going to save by this measure, surely the department must have taken an educated guess as to how many women would be eligible for payment of pension and would be entitled to it. </PARA>

I think the committee would be appreciative of that. What are the minister's assumptions in respect of the 55-year-olds and how many of them are going to be affected?

We had a bit of a similar experience there, and it is a bit of a worry to me that we have elaborate explanations and we do not have the figures to back up the details.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will accept those figures later, but I find it quite extraordinary that Senator Crowley's advisers have not brought such basic figures with them. I want to put that on the record. I also want to take up Senator Harradine's comment through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Patterson who expressed some frustration about the length of this committee stage debate. I think that is a very unfortunate comment. Even after committee hearings have finished, more Australians are interested in the debate and sometimes bring further evidence or clarification of issues to senators as their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, of course, we have the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on superannuation. The big claim was, `Here we are; we are solving the problems of women and superannuation here.' That impacts on the debate on the increasing of the pension age. It is not as if on the committee day that is the end of the story. I think that that was an unfortunate comment, but I actually think that it might also be a desire to cut the debate short because it draws attention to a policy failure on behalf of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took part in a debate with Dr Wooldridge on Adelaide radio yesterday. I think the women of Australia would be really interested to know two points that came out of that debate. Dr Wooldridge said that women have some rewards and compensations, which mean that they do not need the lower pension age. They are that women have lower unemployment rates than men&mdash;that is a big compensation, a bit of an advantage&mdash;and that women live 20 years longer. That is a big reward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are at the end of the paid shift, the unpaid shift, juggling all the stress and everything else that goes with the normal life experiences of a woman. We live 20 years longer; that is a big reward. We should not expect then to be paid an extra 20 years' pension. That is what was said in that debate yesterday. I think that points to a bit of a policy failure on the opposition's behalf as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the opposition that it should not forget the pensioner shares debate. After the committee stage, a lot more evidence came forward and the opposition reviewed its position. I think it should review its position on this piece of legislation as well. The minister said that this is a package. She said there are three important parts to this package: superannuation, industrial relations legislation changes, and education changes&mdash;which this government has brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take the first two to start with. On superannuation I can tell the minister that two years ago we on the select committee told the government that it needed to do something about the low income earners. It was my amendment which raised the threshold from $250 to $450 a month, but the government was not prepared to tackle what would happen to the small nest eggs of low income earners until two years later. Women have been disadvantaged for two years when the government knew the policy failure on that score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the changes are welcome. They mean that small nest eggs are not eroded by exorbitant fees; but the superannuation industry has not tackled that really hard issue of the interrupted working lives of women. So it might be good to have a thousand dollars in there and not eroding, but they are getting nothing when they are not working because they are being a full-time parent. Until we address that, it will be improper to suggest that we have solved this problem of superannuation for women. It will not be there for a huge group of women, particularly those 45 and over. They have had the interruptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of industrial relations, the minister is saying that things are changing. Certainly they are. We have passed industrial relations changes in this place. But, as we have said in this debate, how do we know what the impact of these changes will be on women? Most of the evidence we can see from elsewhere shows that enterprise bargaining has assisted men in full-time jobs. There was not much evidence that it has assisted women clustered in part-time and casual work. They have to be there because there is no flexibility in the workplace to allow them to juggle their working and family lives sufficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because nobody could guarantee that things were going to be better for women under the changes, the Senate agreed to the amendment to monitor this. We said, `Don't wait 10 years down the track and then say that, goodness, it did not happen.' I am asking the minister now: what makes her so certain that the changes that are going to happen under industrial relations reform are going to be for the benefit of women? What makes her certain that women are not going to remain clustered in part-time and casual work, where they will not have pro rata conditions or the same superannuation and savings opportunities as men?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the minister think that in this mythological equality street of the future&mdash;the near future, because this is happening over the next 18 years&mdash;we will find 50 per cent of men who are going to choose to interrupt their working lives to stay home and care for children and for frail and elderly parents?

She has referred previously to the estimated total outlays and savings for the measure, which appear on the second typed page of the explanatory memorandum. The savings indicated total $4.53 million in 1995-96 and $20.16 million in 1996-97.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, what is the basis for assuming that 80 per cent will be receiving alternative DSS income support in 1995-96? Whilst the minister is consulting with the officers, I refer to the figures which state there are 12,060 women whose eligibility for the age pension will be postponed by at least six months in 1995-96. Is the minister saying that 80 per cent of those women&mdash;that is to say, 9,590&mdash;in fact have alternative DSS income support?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The income sources of those projected to remain dependent on other sources of income support are disaggregated in table 1 according to data drawn from ABS labour force statistics and surveys of retirement and retirement intentions. On the basis of these estimates it is projected that approximately 78 per cent of women who would otherwise have received the age pension but will be eligible for alternative DSS income support will continue working, either in a full-time or a part-time capacity. The remainder will be dependent on a partner's income or other private income source such as superannuation, workers compensation or property income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be opposing this clause straight out. I believe it is unfair under this legislation to say to a woman who is 55 years of age at present, who is working for a retail store, who is on her feet all day, and who is looking forward to retiring at age 60, that she has to work another two years. That means that she will have to work another seven years before she is eligible for a pension. I think that is a disgrace. That denies that person freedom of choice&mdash;a freedom of choice that she is entitled to have and expected to have at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has the effect that I mentioned previously of forcing people to stay in the paid work force when the number of jobs available is scarce.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) asked me what criteria I would use to draw the line. I am happy to answer that question. I would wait for evidence of the impact of enterprise bargaining on women. I want to see that women's wages, compared with men's wages, are on the long-term trend upwards. I wait for evidence of improved employment prospects for women 50 and over&mdash;not positions clustered in casual and part-time work without pro rata conditions, but positions with options to accrue meaningful superannuation. I wait for evidence that men and women are accruing similar amounts of superannuation payouts. I wait for evidence of greater attitudinal change, of which the minister spoke earlier, in sharing the responsibilities of parenthood and caring for extended family members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 10 years ago the Labor government assured us that deregulation of the financial institutions would bring great improvements to banking. We were told there would be competitive interest rates and fantastic service. I do not think that promise was delivered&mdash;a great leap of faith was required. Furthermore, the Labor government promised that deregulation of the airlines would mean three airlines, incredibly competitive fares and so on. Well, we do not have three airlines and we do not have the lowest fares we could have. Indeed, we are back to the two-airline policy. Now we have deregulation of the labour market. The minister cannot blame me for being a bit sceptical about what this government promises will happen for women actually happening. The minister should not ask us to take everything on faith. Why can we not wait a little longer until the evidence is clearer before we take this step?</PARA>

A woman now aged 55 who married at 25 and had worked in a bank was forced by the bank to resign when she married. That woman has become unskilled, as she refers to it, over the years and now cares full time for an 88-year-old mother who is crippled and a 92-year-old aunt who is blind. The woman who called me wants to do that. But she asked me whether she is now expected to go out to search for work, and, if she finds it, pay somebody else to do the caring? Is that the ultimate policy goal that the minister is hoping to achieve because she thinks it is better for such people to be in the work force? This woman is asking what she should do. I am asking the minister what she would tell her to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not really want to engage in this debate and run this for any longer than we need to. I believe that it is perfectly possible to say to Senator Kernot: no, that is not what we are doing. There may be an element of that, but there is also an element of assistance and transfer to those women too. For example, if we look at the outcome of what might happen to a woman who decides, because she is not going to get the pension for another six months, to stay on in the work force for six months, to accrue a little more superannuation, to enjoy the socialising and take home the wage, Senator Kernot in that case would say that because of the changes she is advantaged. So the transfer in that case is going in a different direction from the conclusion which Senator Kernot has drawn. What the monitoring will show depends very much on what are the actual figures.

Rural families are still doing it tough. ABARE figures show that only a quarter of our farms will show a profit this year. In debate Senator Boswell made the very good point that many farm families struggle to get food on the table, and I was certainly attracted by his argument. In his contribution, Senator Teague said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a strongly held value within the Liberal and National parties that we will stand up for rural children; we will stand up for the bush.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that from the evidence and from the speeches&mdash;particularly those made by Senator Boswell and Senator Teague&mdash;we have enough evidence to show that family farmers are in big trouble. I urge those whom I know want to stand up for family farmers to support our amendment. I have had conversations with Senator Patterson which indicate that the coalition may not support this amendment. After the RAS inquiry is finished we should look at the effects of the assets tests on all pensions for rural families. Amendment No. 3 will exempt farm assets from the assets test on both the additional and basic family payments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, the Greens welcome the report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, NBEET, and the Higher Education Council, HEC, which reviews the funding allocations set out in the ministerial statement `Higher education funding for the 1994-96 triennium'. The report by NBEET and the HEC make some salient observations about the trends in funding higher education places and makes some concerned comments about access to clinical training in health fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens concur with the criteria for the allocation of growth funds: they should be targeted to regions with high population growth and low tertiary education participation. We must make sure that there is access to student places in regions where participation needs to be increased. It is necessary that we take a more proactive role in socio-economically disadvantaged areas to balance the current majority middle class patronage of our tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to encourage participation in disadvantaged regions, we must look at the problem holistically. The provision of places alone will not solve the problem but is one step towards it. We need to review the economic burdens accorded to these students that act as a barrier to taking up and finishing a tertiary education. Austudy is necessary to these students but it puts them below the poverty line. It is not even on a par with the dole and does not have a rent assistance component, which would assist students living in areas like Sydney and Melbourne where there is a high cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The targeting of school leavers has its problems, which NBEET and the HEC have acknowledged. Their report quite rightly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">School leavers are not the only group of students who enter higher education for the first time and targets for school leavers may disadvantage those other first timers, such as mature age entrants, many of whom are under 30 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>The Greens concur with this proposition. We also add that many of these mature age entrants are women who are trying to get back into the work force and many are credit transfer students from other colleges and the TAFE system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's efforts to make intakes favour school leavers, it has taken places away from other worthy students. This is part of the system that operates with the current budget process&mdash;giving to one group by taking away from another. In Western Australia last year, quotas for school leavers were higher than demand and universities had to let in students on lower tertiary entrance scores to fill the places. This worked to the disadvantage of mature age and credit transfer entrants who themselves deserve affirmative action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be investigating the quotas for mature age and credit transfer students as a percentage of the commencing undergraduate load. However, as the council rightly points out, quotas can set rigid targets for universities which may inappropriately affect the academic work of those institutions. Perhaps we could look at encouraging mature age and credit transfer students by setting up a national credit bank system and/or a recognition of prior learning pilot program to help mature age people with experience to get credits in courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised to read in the statement on higher education for the 1994-96 triennium that the Commonwealth is approaching the limit of its capacity to expand publicly funded places in higher education. I was surprised because the defence portfolio underspent $500 million in the 1993-94 financial year and that money could have been transferred to social services. I must say that there were quick moves within the defence portfolio to spend that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must make sure that the government continues to maintain public funding to ensure the integrity of our tertiary institutions and to ensure that they do not become the lackeys of business when it comes to the quality of education and research they deliver. These days, the government is only providing 66 per cent of total university income. Students deserve a well-rounded education and not a solely technical one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, looking at the criteria for shifting currently allocated student places, we should reprioritise the criteria to emphasise equity group progression and completion rates, quality of provision and graduate employment outcomes. We should allocate places not only on the basis of meeting school leaver targets but on the basis of equity of disadvantaged groups as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council on the allocation of funds to higher education institutions. While the document speaks about the higher education contribution scheme, it also has a lot to say about the profiling process that is going on in universities and how universities react to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Higher Education Council for its report, particularly the rather critical view it takes of the way in which DEET is handling the profiling process. Very clearly, there are problems with this process. An enormous amount of the universities' resources are wasted on this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Universities should be focusing on research, teaching and scholarship but they have to spend a lot of time jumping through the hoops put up by DEET, gathering an enormous amount of data for it. I wonder what is done with much of that data because it does not seem to be of a lot of use to the universities. DEET says that this process is becoming less intrusive but, as I go around the universities, the vice-chancellors are telling me something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its criticism, the HEC describes one particular part of the profiling process&mdash;the visits by DEET to the universities&mdash;as being of questionable value. They are becoming more and more routine and, given that they cover a huge agenda in a very short time&mdash;government policy, budget, student loans, resource management and evaluation&mdash;and given that the universities have to spend a lot of time preparing for these visits, I wonder about their value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council also criticises the short notice given to universities of these visits and of the documentation and other things required. I think the days of this process are numbered. It is not helped by the fact that there is an enormous turnover in DEET staff. That is compounded by the reorganisation of the various divisions within DEET, which means that, as the profile process continues year after year, the universities are dealing with different people&mdash;people not familiar with the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also considerable mobility at the highest levels of DEET. There are rumours that the first assistant secretary, Michael Gallagher, will be moving on. That is not good for stability and consistent policy development across the higher education sector because at the same time a lot of senior staff are moving around and moving out. There is also the matter of the mobility of senior ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 we had Mr Dawkins looking after this area of government; in 1992 we had Mr Baldwin; in 1993 we had Mr Beazley; in 1994 we have Mr Crean; and one wonders who we will have next year in 1995. Changing ministers each year is not good for the process and for policy coherence. This has resulted in creating problems in HECS. Changes from minister to minister have brought about a number of changes in this scheme that have become very unsettling for students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It started out as a very good scheme, particularly the way in which it was repaid on a deferred basis through the tax system. But, again, the government has changed the goalposts and brought policy instability into this area. Parents send a child to university; they have a certain fee level and a way of repaying over a certain period of time. It becomes very disturbing to people involved in the higher education process that all of this changes. The government has changed the rate at which payment is to be made and it has also changed the timing of those payments. The reason is that there is now about $2 billion in outstanding HECS debt and Treasury wants to get its hands on it as quickly as possible. The Australian Tax Office does not always know the answers to questions and this compounds the problem. We have many students writing to us complaining about policy confusion in this area. This report raises these concerns and they are things which should greatly concern this Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The first matter I wish to raise is the Hilmer report because honourable senators and others would be aware that that report sought to inquire into whether certain statutory corporations and government business enterprises should be subject to the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a pressing issue in the bush where the National Party of Australia sees a grave threat to statutory marketing arrangements from one end of this country to the other. Being a senator from Queensland, as is Senator Boswell, I am very concerned that nothing be done which would seek to erode the sole export power of the Queensland Sugar Corporation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Wheat Board, of course; but the Queensland Sugar Corporation has particular interest for Queensland because it yields a five per cent additional benefit to our sugar producers over what they would get on an open market. In other words, the complete deregulation of the export powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation would lead to a loss to sugar producers, not a gain. One must ask who receives the benefit if the total income of Australian sugar producers is reduced by five per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to popular belief in this area, the benefit does not flow to consumers. The benefit flows to the overseas processors who purchase the raw sugar, process it and sell it back to this country. Not the slightest bit of benefit would be passed on to the consumer. When we consider issues of competition policy, particularly in relation to statutory marketing arrangements, we in the National Party say that these issues must be looked at with an eye to the national interest and where the national interest is best served by the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if they bestow a monopoly, it is appropriate that those arrangements be allowed to continue because any erosion of those arrangements is not to the benefit of the consumer but to the detriment of the producer and the export interests of this country. I need not remind any honourable senator that this country currently has a current account deficit of some $18 billion, or $1 1/2 billion a month, and anything of a legislative nature which will exacerbate this problem is definitely not in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I wish to briefly address&mdash;and I know that my Senate colleague Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, has long had an interest in this&mdash;is in relation to the cost of bringing actions under the Trade Practices Act. At page 41 of the report, the Law Reform Commission identifies particular cost barriers experienced by business, especially small businesses which seek to take advantage of the Trade Practices Act. If I may read very briefly from the report, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business operators, especially small businesses, seeking remedies under the TPA, either as consumers of goods or services provided by other businesses or as competitors protecting their commercial interests, often encounter problems in addition to those outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the problems being experienced by private litigants. A number of those are listed: for example, the need to lodge security for damages when seeking an injunction; and the difficulty of the corporation having to be legally represented. It points out that it is open to consideration as to whether the Trade Practices Commission should play a bigger role in helping small business to enforce the Trade Practices Act. When the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs looked at these issues, Senator Boswell was foremost in ensuring that changes were made to the benefit of small business. </PARA>

<PARA>I only want to make one point tonight on this very important document. The Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome is caused by a virus where people have been infected by pituitary material prepared from human pituitary glands and some of those glands, clearly, were infected with a slow virus which many years later caused the onset of this disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pituitary hormone extract was used for treating children of short stature or women who were infertile. That is the background to the disease. Because of the slow nature of the onset, these cases only started to appear more recently even though treatment was begun in the 1960s. It is possible that some cases will continue to appear for quite some time into the future. It is a fatal disease and is the cause of very great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I want to make this evening is simply this: the very first recommendation of the committee is that research funds be allocated for the provision of adequate laboratory facilities equipped to conduct research into the effective CJD agent. The Senate would be aware that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories that prepared these extracts has recently been sold. The Senate would also be aware that this government is very committed to the privatisation of as much research effort in Australia as possible. I draw attention to the fact that only 2,100 people in Australia were treated with this pituitary hormone. That might sound a large number but, so far, four women have died as a result of this treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is a very simple one: that small incidence of disease, even though it is a very serious and fatal disease, is not likely to attract private investment in research. The numbers of people involved are far too few to attract private research. This is typically research which must be carried out in government laboratories at government expense. The sorts of things that private funded laboratories are interested in are those diseases which affect large numbers of people, where there is a sale of a product to large numbers of people and where profits can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to stress to the government that this primary recommendation is one which it will find hard to meet if it continues with its present program and the cutback in funds for CSIRO, medical research and other areas of research as well. This is typically an area of research which falls outside the area that will attract private funding. If this recommendation is to be taken up by government, it is urgent that it recognises that it must involve government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA>I have only one point to make and that is in regard to the statement of the Hon. Ralph Willis, the Treasurer of this country, regarding superannuation. It is a welcome statement because there has been so much change over the last 10 years of this government's life in the area of superannuation and a great deal of confusion has reigned in the marketplace regarding government policy and superannuation policy. It is a complex area; there is no doubt about that. It is an area in which I do not profess to have a great deal of skill, and many people in this chamber would have to come to the same conclusion. It is a specialist area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Showing the modesty that my colleague Senator O'Chee did in his speech just previously, I do not pretend that I am able to grapple with the mammoth paperwork involved in superannuation. But there is someone in this Senate who needs the recognition of this chamber, and that, of course, is Senator Watson. He is to be congratulated for the policy work that he has put into this particular area of superannuation, in which he is a well known specialist, in his advice in helping the government and the people of Australia. We are forever in his debt in this area because it is a most important area for retirees in this country, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that this statement does not go far enough in relation to a national savings policy. For that reason, it is most disappointing. It is not just me who is disappointed. It is more significant that Dr Vince FitzGerald, the government appointee with regard to establishing recommendations toward a national savings policy, is more disappointed than anyone. One would have thought the government, in establishing a superannuation policy, would integrate it with the national savings policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from the AAP the full text of Dr Vince FitzGerald's comments regarding his disappointment about the Treasurer's statement yesterday. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The government has been very reluctant to do anything to require the preservation of concessionally-taxed super benefits until normal retirement age" . . . Dr Fitzgerald said the biggest losers from the government's failure to deal with the issue of double dipping by early retirees into super and the pension would be young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The eldest among them would barely be of voting age and they are the people who will be paying for baby boomer-aged pensions in 30, 40 years or more time and the youngest of them have not been born yet," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We are giving very little regard to the interests of future young Australians who will have the burden of something like $10 billion or $20 billion shared around on their shoulders."</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite a dramatic statement by Dr Vince FitzGerald with regard to the future of the government's superannuation policy. They are rather chilling predictions by a man who should, in his position, know what the future will hold in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say that the Treasurer's statement was appreciated and welcomed for what it said because the government has tackled the one area in superannuation that has brought alarm to the working man and woman, and that is how fees eat into the early parts of the superannuation scheme, particularly the guaranteed superannuation requirements. In that regard, the government has been seemingly successful in introducing a threshold below which fees cannot be charged&mdash;I believe it is up to $1,000&mdash;and the tax department may, by choice, handle up to $1,200 worth of superannuation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the report recently tendered by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs dealing with breast cancer screening and treatment in Australia. As I was a member of this committee and participated in the extensive public hearings I would like to highlight some of the findings and recommendations. The committee recommended that, as there is a target age group for women to participate in breast cancer screening, representations should be made to the Victorian Electoral Commissioner to gain access to the roll for the purposes of that state's screening program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would expedite contact with a number of women who need to be contacted so they will ring the breast screening agencies and make an appointment to be screened. If access via the electoral roll is not granted, it is reasonably difficult for a target age group to be located and contacted. Agencies such as the Electoral Commission certainly make it much easier. Victoria in particular is lagging behind in contacting the relevant age group. Mechanisms such as that would enable it to catch up with the other states and more women could be contacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also agreed that breast cancer support and counselling services be encouraged and expanded. Many of the witnesses gave us graphic evidence of the importance of providing adequate psycho-social support. A woman confronted with breast cancer is shocked and distressed. She is faced with many mental adjustments at a time when she is also confronted with a number of decisions regarding treatment or surgery. It is during this period and, indeed, after any treatment or surgery that counselling and other support is vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important role played by support groups is underlined by the United States study which shows that women who attend support services had a significantly better quality of life and survived, on average, twice as long as other women who did not attend such groups. My daughter is a member of the Royal District Nursing Service. During the course of her daily work she visits women who have had treatment for breast cancer. She told me that the importance of follow-up support was absolutely vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a country woman, I also noted that strategies should be implemented to improve access to the program in rural and remote areas. These strategies involve, where appropriate, the provision of financial assistance to encourage women to participate in the program. It is obviously not a cost-effective exercise in extremely remote areas for treatment facilities to be taken to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was given that it may be possible to transport small numbers of women to an appropriate treatment area. I would like to see that happen. Similarly, linkages between screening centres in rural and regional areas and treatment centres in major centres should be encouraged so that information transfer regarding effective treatment can be facilitated. People living in the country, particularly professionals practising in the country, often feel that they are the poor relations in a technical knowledge sense of professionals operating in the city. A transfer of information between those two groups would facilitate the whole program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We particularly looked at the provision of facilities for non-English speaking background women. The committee decided that strategies sensitive to their cultural backgrounds and their values should be implemented to increase the access of women from these groups to the program. Certain ethnic groups, particularly the more recent arrivals, need to be specifically targeted to encourage their participation. I am thinking particularly of Vietnamese women and women of Turkish and Arab extraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well-established ethnic groups such as Italians and Greeks were much less reluctant to attend for screening. In some ethnic communities it is important to target the male members of the household so that they may, in turn, speak to the female members of their households about the importance of attending for screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the program that was noted was the importance of integrating both private and public facilities so that any duplication in the provision of screening services could be avoided. Obviously, this is a very cost-intensive program to set up and maintain. If existing excellent private facilities can be utilised, that would be so much the better. But, at the same time, those services should meet the guidelines for accreditation established by the national program so that there is always excellent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several states, including New South Wales and Victoria, use a successful mix of facilities in the public and private sectors. The other area that I would like to touch on in this adjournment debate is the fundamental importance of research into the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. I would like the Commonwealth government to provide a specific allocation for research into breast cancer in future Commonwealth budgets. I was very pleased to see that this was provided for by the government in the recent budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that ongoing research be provided. Many of the medical authorities who spoke to us indicated that it was very necessary for more research to be done because at the moment there is simply not enough research to extrapolate some of the programs. Ongoing research is needed on a certain basis so that research facilities and centres can plan their programs accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, there is a facility for a mix of public&mdash;that is, government funded research&mdash;and privately funded research. The Hancock Foundation, particularly in Perth, has started private fundraising for breast cancer screening and research. It is hoped that several initiatives being started in the eastern states will follow along those lines so there will be both public and private sector interaction in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private donations to cancer research have been falling dramatically. I welcome the $2 million in annual funding for the government fundraising foundation. I hope that continues. It would probably have been better spent on funding tax deductibility for private donations but at this stage I am happy to see that a certain avenue of funding is established specifically. I would certainly encourage the government to continue along that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found participating in this committee on this aspect of women's health a particularly gratifying enterprise because many of the women to whom I have spoken since about the progress of the program were not aware of it before. It is only through public education that women will know how to look after their own health better and make sure that they participate in the program. For that reason alone I was very happy to be a member of the committee and to participate in bringing down its findings. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst attribute of the Western Australian government is its slash and burn approach to the environment, which is consistent with some of the other attitudes that I have referred to. Nothing is further from such a mind-set than Australia's international obligations in a range of environmental areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has so far refused to join the National Environment Protection Council. It insists that it has a right to expose Western Australians to higher levels of ground, water and air pollution than Australians elsewhere. Apparently, Western Australia is also prepared to breach international wildlife protection conventions. I refer to the RAMSAR convention, which protects habitats vital for migratory birds. The Creery Wetlands near Mandurah in Western Australia is one such essential habitat which the Court government is intent on turning into a canal complex and a real estate bonanza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year it was reported that Western Australia breached its obligations under the inter-governmental agreement on the environment by failing to provide details of its environment programs to the heads of government meeting. But is there anything to report? I will list some matters that do need reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has opened its national parks to mining. To be fair, this trend began with the previous Labor state government and has simply continued. The Western Australian government has recently exempted Western Mining Corporation for two years from meeting the standards of a new environmental protection policy on sulphur dioxide. The environment minister, Mr Minson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the exemption would give the company the time it needed to develop a way of controlling emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian government rejected the Resource Assessment Council's findings in its final report on coastal zoning. The Western Australian minister for planning declared that he is strongly opposed to any overarching national coastal management legislation, any national coordinating agency or a national agency committee. The Western Australian government does not see the need for specific coastal management legislation at this stage. We may well ask when it will see it. There is only the slimmest chance that Western Australia will participate in a national pollutant inventory or recognise that its citizens have a right to know what toxic and polluting compounds are remitted into their environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, this government will tell its citizens that they enjoy environmental protection standards amongst the highest in the world, as Mr Minson, Western Australia's environment minister, did in February this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give Senator Kemp examples. Currently, our per capita greenhouse emissions are 11 tonnes per person. By contrast, those of the United States are 10 per cent lower; Canada's emissions are 17 per cent lower; and those of OECD countries are an average of 45 per cent lower. We have among the highest emission levels per person in the world. Our efficiency levels show that it is not because we are producing so much, but because we are slack, irresponsible and selfishly allowing our irresponsibility to impact on nature and the rest of humanity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australia, with a per capita energy use level of 215 gigajoules per annum, says that we will not do anything, why should any nation like China, with a per capita energy consumption of 24 gigajoules, do anything but increase energy consumption as fast as possible? Chinese consumption is high compared with the rest of industrialising Asia&mdash;Thailand consumes 17 gigajoules; the Philippines, 12; Indonesia, 10; and India, with a population of nearly one billion, currently consumes only 9 gigajoules per capita. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple way to measure the efficiency of energy used in what a nation produces: energy use is divided by gross domestic product.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;European nations, starting at a much lower level, declined by about 33 per cent. Japan's energy per GDP ratio&mdash;this includes hydro power&mdash;declined in the same period by 33 per cent. Australia bucked this trend and saw its energy-GDP ratio increase by 10 per cent. Is Australia some sort of unique case? Is it the tyranny of distance perhaps?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Neither Canada nor the US is a small nation. When we include transport over the US-Canadian border and now over the Mexican border, distances are vast. Australia is also one of the most urbanised nations on earth. Although we have vast areas, few people live in them and most live in greater urban areas. Few people live in the dispersed condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transport demands and demands of large dispersed rural population in North America greatly increased its transport needs. Canada and the United States are far colder climatically than Australia. These are both structural factors that increase demand for energy, yet these nations have increased the efficiency of energy use by 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan, starting with a rate of efficiency far higher than Australia, has increased efficiency by 34 per cent. The United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Sweden have all increased their efficiency by about 30 per cent or more. Efficiency therefore does not relate solely to transport; it is industrial efficiency, too. Australia decreased its efficiency over this period. Currently Japan and Germany use respectively 65 per cent and 47 per cent the energy that we do for every dollar's worth of goods that they produce. Clearly they have increased the gap between their efficiency and ours even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada, the United States of America and Sweden have significant amounts of hydro power, which does not change price with oil and does not pollute, although it is not free of environmental problems. Nevertheless, these nations with high amounts of hydro and less need to reduce energy use have all increased their energy efficiency by 33 per cent. We use coal and petrol and we have decreased our efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has one of the highest levels of petrol consumption per capita in the world. Most of this gives no benefit to the economy. An increasing amount of this consumption is dependent on oil imports, and so has negative effects on our economy. Our oil consumption is mainly for transport, and transport consumption involves structural issues that make change difficult in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the economic problems of oil supply and sudden changes in price, there are the continual problems of the emissions from cars and vehicles, emissions which are responsible for a third of our greenhouse emissions. Cars produce greenhouse emissions, carbon monoxide emissions, emissions that lead to acid rain, lead emissions, carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbon and aromatic carbon emissions, ozone emissions, and the consequent chemical soup that results when sunshine hits this mess to turn it into photochemical smog. These emissions pose a number of health and environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic problems are caused by the cost of pandering to sprawling cities, and often part of these costs are viciously cyclic, in that one impact of sprawl is that it makes alternatives, from public transport to walking, more difficult. It makes car ownership more necessary to maintain access to basic social needs. Infrastructure of all sorts&mdash;from provision of electricity and water to provision of policing&mdash;becomes more expensive. With more people dependent on cars, the need&mdash;and cost&mdash;of providing, building, maintaining and regulating roads increases. The cost of providing parking, using large amounts of prime real estate, increases. All of this adds further to urban social problems and dis-equity. None of it benefits our economy, ecology or quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has adopted an attitude that leads it to ignore these issues. In the process it ignores many basic aspects of equity, ecological sustainability and economics. Energy conservation and energy efficiency are not just about greenhouse or climate conventions; and government abandonment of the climate convention is more about its refusal to deal with our incredibly profligate and economically unproductive use of energy than about any other thing. As such it represents a high level of social irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It costs nothing to demand that industry sells Australia the same cars that it will sell in Europe and the United States. It costs nothing to ensure that at the very least new buildings have decent levels of insulation and energy conservation built in. Good design costs less in the long run. In fact, it will save us money&mdash;money that otherwise must be spent on energy production so that those who can afford to do so can power heaters and air conditioners to make houses that are poorly built more livable. Putting in basic efficiency standards on vehicles would ensure that our transport is not too much more expensive than that of other nations, and would reduce the need to import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not improve our competitive position to use twice as much energy in production than our competitors. The answer is not to subsidise power. The answer is to conserve power, to develop efficient technology, and to reduce energy consumption per unit. The answer is also to exercise just a bit of foresight and recognise that as materials and their costs increase, alternatives must be developed in sufficient time so that they will be available, instead of waiting for a crisis and trying to cope with a dire situation, and demand sacrifices that could be avoided by a grain of wisdom now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Virtually all OECD nations have been able to greatly increase their efficiency. Closer to home, California, a competitor in the Pacific, has grown economically and in population, while actually having its total electricity consumption decline from 140 billion KWh in 1980 to 114 billion KWh in 1990. This is a decline of nearly 20 per cent in 10 years. California went from generating 50 per cent of power from oil to generating only one per cent from oil. The majority comes from gas, but 10 per cent now comes from co-generation, energy use that otherwise would go to waste. Seven per cent comes from geothermal sources. California also has the distinction of producing more overall energy from wind and solar sources than any state or nation on earth. Electricity conversion is generally responsible for about a third of greenhouse emissions. Alternative energy such as wind, geothermal and co-generation are included as energy use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For how long have we had to listen to industrial troglodytes pushing the line that the main way to improve industry's competitiveness is via labour market reforms, tax cuts and less environment scrutiny? When least cost planning is suggested, they head for the bunkers. The coal industry might not be happy but, as Amory Lovin from the Rocky Mountain Institute suggested, if we do not mine coal it is not entirely useless&mdash;it is very good for holding up the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are leading us to environmental and social disaster predict doom every time anyone suggests we try something else.

Mr Mani Taing arrived here four and a half years ago and is the sole remaining member of the first group of asylum seekers to arrive by boat from Cambodia not to have been released. Mr Taing has not accepted the government's offer under its SAP plan of late last year to return to Cambodia with the prospect of coming back to Australia after an appropriate period because he has an extreme fear of returning to Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Because of Mr Taing's recent disturbed behaviour as a result of this deterioration in his mental health, the manager of the Port Hedland detention centre has transferred Mr Taing down to the detention centre at Perth domestic airport for what has been described to me as a cooling off period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the short background of the psychological  assessment. Some time ago I engaged the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture and Trauma to report on people still in detention. That team was led by Paris Aristotle who I think Senator Short may know. He has been involved, together with Father Peter Hosking, a clinical psychologist, in assessment of cases in detention. I have asked them to prepare a report for me. That report is&mdash;as Senator Short may not know&mdash;in the hands of the department. As part of that assessment process, the person Senator Short referred to has moved to Perth for further psychiatric assessment. The Foundation for Survivors of Torture and Trauma was asked to do this assessment with a view to seeing which cases, if any, should receive my consideration. I expect to get the report from that foundation and those consultants in the not too distant future. </PARA>

<TITLE>Social Justice for Rural Youth</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="2357" SPEAKER="Boswell Sen R.L.D." NAMEID="YE4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the National Party of Australia)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (7.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the very important need to bring about some form of social justice for rural youth who form one of the most disadvantaged groups in society, a group the government has ignored. Despite the underpinning rationale of the government's recent white paper, Working Nation, that the youth of Australia should be in school, in training or in employment, many rural youth are excluded from one or more of these options in a way that is unfair and inequitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly I deal with education. Countless numbers of eligible students cannot afford to continue their education, as a result of their family's essential farm assets disqualifying them from Austudy assets tests despite their having a very low income. Currently, students cannot be assessed for Austudy independently of their parents until they reach the age of 23. Are these rural students expected to wait six or seven years before completing their education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I turn to jobs and training. As we all know, employment prospects for the young people in rural centres are bleak. For rural students denied the opportunity to finish their schooling, there is little hope to be found in the jobs compact. The $96,000 jobstart wage subsidised placements during 1993 were mainly sourced from the retail, manufacturing, entertainment, restaurant, construction and wholesale trade. Clearly the vast bulk of these jobs would be found in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment of $50 million to regional policy will go nowhere towards creating anything like the job opportunities that will be found in the capital cities. The new youth training allowance for under 18s is subject to the same means test as Austudy. Unless these children move away from home and declare themselves independent of their parents&mdash;at a time, I might add, when they need their parents the most&mdash;the same number of young people who currently cannot access Austudy cannot access the youth training allowance except for the minimum non-means tested payment of $30 a week. Unable to afford to continue their education, unable to get a job, unable to access the training allowance except for the minimum payment, countless numbers of rural youth are cast aside by the government. Why are the dependants of the vital wealth creating primary industries sector treated with such callous disregard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia today is a divided country. The gulf between metropolitan and rural and regional Australia in employment, essential services, prospects and lifestyles is widening each year. Rural youth are particularly hard hit. One-third of under 25-year-olds are unemployed. The only way they will ever gain employment when economic conditions improve is if they are sufficiently skilled to meet the skill levels demanded by employers. We need a trained, highly skilled work force, and the best way to achieve this is through assisting able students to complete their secondary and tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely lamentable that able students have been denied the right to pursue tertiary studies at university or TAFE because their parents' farm assets disqualify them from receiving Austudy payments. One of the most inequitable situations that exists in Australian society today is that of students from low income farm families who are prevented from participating in further education as a result of being denied Austudy assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Department of Employment, Education and Training brochure states, without financial help thousands of students would be unable to complete their education. This is certainly the case with many farm families which have been consistently denied Austudy eligibility because they hold farm assets over the assets threshold, despite having low or zero incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that because a farmer owns a property valued at over $734,000&mdash;the current assets limit&mdash;he can afford to educate his children, cannot in many cases be validated. A farm and farm related assets cannot be realised easily. We are still in the midst of a rural recession and the effects are being felt nationwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third of Queensland and New South Wales is drought declared. The recent ABARE survey report reveals that the average broadacre farm profits have been negative for the fourth consecutive year. This represents the average&mdash;many farmers would have experienced negative profits for far longer than four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool growers have been struggling on under low prices for several years now. The special circumstances that affect rural families, such as prolonged drought and low wool prices, have to be acknowledged. Children from struggling farm families should not be denied an opportunity to further their education because of the family farm assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recently prepared NFF submission contains DEET estimates that rural people's participation in higher education is only two-thirds the rate of people in urban areas. Data collected by DEET shows that in 1993 there were 450,000 Austudy applicants; 506 applications were refused because they failed the assets test and 48 per cent of those were rural applicants.</PARA>
