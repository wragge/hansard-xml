<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind the minister that last Friday the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, spoke of a 300 per cent growth in the number of people the Salvation Army has had to assist in the past year. I also remind the minister that this followed the release by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of its social trends report which demonstrated objectively a growing gap in this country between rich and poor, reinforcing what social commentators such as Mr Hugh Mackay have been referring to as the development of a new underclass in Australia. I ask the minister whether the development of a new underclass in Australian society is part of Labor's vision of social justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="905" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered that question yesterday. There is no statistical foundation for any suggestion that there is a growing disparity between rich and poor in this country. Everything depends on the way in which these things are counted. If non-monetary income is not taken into account&mdash;in terms of non-cash benefits such as access to concessions, health services and public housing&mdash;and if household incomes are not taken into account as distinct from merely individual incomes, some of the fundamental social changes and economic changes that have occurred in the structure of the Australian economy over the last 10 years are missed. Of course it is the case that there has been an increase in the number of people suffering economic disadvantage as a result of the recession of the last couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A highly central feature of this government's strategy as a result, unmatched by any comparable strategy on the Leader of the Opposition's side of politics, is to do something about that through a combination of macro-economic and micro-economic reform and also more particularly through the strategy in the white paper of ensuring that the most likely candidates to become a permanent underclass in this country&mdash;namely, the long-term unemployed&mdash;have in fact some hope for the future as a result of the retraining strategies that we are putting in place. That is the rationale more than anything else for the white paper&mdash;to create new opportunities for getting back into the work force for a very large number of people who have been unemployed for far too long and who would otherwise be denied those opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far from welcoming that with open arms, so far from welcoming it with any degree of compassion, any degree of commitment or any degree of understanding as to what the social and the economic needs of this country may be, we have had from the opposition nothing but partisan point-scoring, carping and an unwillingness to support the basic strategies. We have had no understanding of the need for a social safety net in this country. We have had no understanding. We had a former Leader of the Opposition saying that if people stretch out their hands to be helped you have to be very careful they do not drag you back down with them. That is what Dr Hewson was saying. He was not disowned by anyone on the opposite side of politics; he has not been disowned by the new model leadership that is trying to present a face of compassion to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that we have had the policies throughout the course of the 1980s, and we are continuing to evolve and develop those policies to deal with the situation as we confront it. There is no foundation whatsoever for that attack. This is a record of social redistribution of income and a record of helping those on the bottom end of the scale that any government could reasonably be proud of.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has missed the point. It is not a matter of us attacking him. It is his government's failure to appreciate what it has been told by independent authorities,  such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics. On page 137, it says, `What we have seen is a polarisation of full-time employees into comparatively high and low income earners.' That is reinforced by concerns such as those of Mr Hugh Mackay, who talks of this growing underclass in Australia under Labor. Why will Labor not listen to the messengers rather than simply dismiss them? Why will it not address the real concerns&mdash;900,000 Australians out of work? When interest rates start to rise again, the current account goes bad&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one is talking about a polarisation of high and low income earners in this country, what greater degree of polarisation would there be with the kind of industrial relations policy that those opposite would foist on the Australian public? It is an industrial relations policy based entirely on the law of the jungle. It is an industrial relations policy which does not take into account at all the need for basic award and safety net conditions to be established for low income earners. It is the law of the jungle and it is par for the course as far as that lot is concerned, and they should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to promote that in an environment where there are policy alternatives&mdash;policy alternatives that are sensibly and effectively being put in place by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I note that the government has implemented its promised $30 million capital injection into the Commonwealth Development Bank to increase the bank's capacity to lend to small and medium sized enterprises. Does the minister believe that this injection will bridge the gap between the demands of small businesses for capital and the availability of finance from traditional sources?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="906" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government recognises that access to finance by small and medium sized companies in Australia is an essential precondition for those companies to grow and develop. That has been a theme of a lot of our economic statements and is a key feature of the industry section of the white paper that was released in the last sitting period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Treasurer announced an injection of $30 million into the Commonwealth Development Bank. This completes the third step of the announcements we made in the statement Investing in the Nation. The other two steps were continuing a subsidy of $20 million to support the Commonwealth Development Bank's financing activities and expanding the CDB's charter so that it is not defined as a supplementary lending authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital injection will expand the Commonwealth Development Bank's lending capability even further. Importantly, it will become a cash flow lender&mdash;that is, it will place importance on the cash flow of companies rather than on the bricks and mortar securities they might offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the white paper we announced an additional $2 million to promote the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is considerable evidence that a lot of small to medium sized companies do not effectively access the Commonwealth Development Bank. We want to draw its expertise to their attention and indicate that it is a lender further out on the risk spectrum than the major lending banks and that it has a very good prudential record as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvements to the Commonwealth Development Bank are, of course, part of the wider strategy by the government of making finance available to small to medium sized companies. Australia has a well-developed equity market for large companies; small businesses are not as well served. Small businesses, particularly in the early stages of growth, need to use new technology to increase their growth and they constantly point to problems revealed in all the surveys about raising funds for equity investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To encourage the provision of long-term equity capital to small Australian businesses, the government has reduced the concessional tax rate for pooled development fund profits derived from investment in small Australian businesses. The restrictions under which the pooled development funds operate have been eased to make them more user friendly for small companies in Australia. To assist small companies find equity finance, the government will fund pilot programs to match small firms requiring equity finance with their potential investors&mdash;the so-called business angels approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major casualties of the rapid changes in the finance sector and the business sector has been communications between lenders and borrowers. The government has taken active steps to improve relations between lenders and borrowers with the goal of improving small business access to debt finance. The government will spend $1.2 million to establish a model of business best practice to help banks to lend on cash flow principles based on an improved understanding of business prospects. The government will provide training material for accountants, business advisers and financiers to help them understand the special needs of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of particular problems in access to both debt and equity finance concerns our emerging exporters. We have said at some length what we are doing to expand our overseas network for market intelligence which will be available to small to medium size companies in Australia, and based on the McKinsey study of emerging exporters and the forthcoming LEK study of service companies&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. In light of the revelations at Senate Estimates Committee B last week that the executive officer of the Trade Union Training Authority had, firstly, signed a joint venture agreement with the ACTU on behalf of TUTA, a taxpayer funded statutory authority, one day before the election in a bid to frustrate coalition policy in the event of a coalition victory; secondly, allowed at least $100,000 of library facilities to be removed from a publicly controlled authority to ACTU headquarters in Melbourne; and, thirdly, allowed the joint venture to be based on an equal partnership with the ACTU, when the ACTU provided only one-sixth of the capital input, will the minister seek the resignation of the executive officer of the Trade Union Training Authority, Kate Woods?</PARA></TALK.START>

One could read the evidence and find that many of the assumptions in his question are not true. As was pointed out at the estimates committee hearing, the signing on 12 March was basically irrelevant because it could just as easily have been signed on 20 March or 25 March under delegated authority. It could have been signed on any one of those days. The second part of Senator Abetz's question&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

They do it year in, year out. They get this great group therapy out of it. They all get excited about union bashing.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The defence rests on those opposite being union bashers. Senator Campbell has once again demonstrated his paranoia about this. The second point I want to make in relation to the agreement between the ACTU and TUTA is that, whilst it is clear that TUTA put in a higher degree of resources than did the ACTU, two factors should be borne in mind. Firstly, if this was such a conspiracy, why did they enter into a 12-month contract when they know that any future government can run for three years? Secondly, Senator Abetz has the contract. He has read it. He knows that at the end of the contract there are provisions for the disposal of assets. He also knows that that contract has now expired. So there was no rip-off of public resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz would now know that there was a supplementary agreement when additional resources were required. Thirdly, he would know that there is a temporary agreement through to 30 June about this particular arrangement, depending upon whether there is a future contract. If there is no future contract, the disposition of assets will be achieved in a proportional way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed not. I have had this particular advertisement drawn to my attention. I am aware that considerable concern has been expressed, particularly in Western Australia, about this advertising campaign and its possible effect on young sportsmen and sportswomen. At this stage I have only been able to read a transcript of this television advertisement. But the campaign portrays a number of sports stars with considerable appeal to young sports people: Craig Johnston from soccer; David Campese from rugby union; Dean Lukin from weight-lifting; and Dean Capobianco from athletics. The sportsmen are asked a range of questions in the advertisement. For instance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q. Would you compete without them?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dean Capobianco: No.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q. Do you think it's fair?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q. What would you say about young people using them?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dean Capobianco: I'd say go for it.</PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement finishes up with the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody said you can't use performance enhancing shoes.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view there is an implication that these approving words could be understood to be referring to performance enhancing drugs. But in case anyone missed the point, there is an associated poster with the campaign depicting a sports shoe being injected in the heel by what looks like a syringe with the same slogan underneath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister for sport, I am very concerned that the approving themes in this campaign alluding to performance enhancing drugs in sport could undermine the strong stance that has been taken by the federal government against the use of these drugs. The government, through the Australian Sports Drug Agency, has been working very hard with sporting bodies, the athletes themselves, Australian sportspeople, to promote a drug free sporting life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sports Drug Agency is widely recognised as having one of the most effective drugs in sport education programs in the world. As minister, I very strongly support the education and testing programs of the agency. I cannot condone the undermining of that very important work by the images in this particular advertisement.</PARA>

<PARA>ASDA has also described the advertisement as extremely damaging. I have spoken today with the General Manager of Adidas in Australia, Mr Robin Berry, and indicated my views to him on this particular issue. He informed me that the advertisement had been approved by the commercial acceptance division of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. I know that Adidas has been active in sponsoring junior sport, as I am sure many senators would be aware, and it has, over the years, upheld its responsibility to sport in general. I have asked that the company reconsider the thrust of this particular advertising campaign in the light of any possible effect on young Australian sports people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case that position is in doubt, Dr Lawrence made that position quite clear in the House of Representatives yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thanks very much troops! Good on you; that is right! In answer to Senator Lees's question, what happens is that when there is an application to the minister for an exemption, the minister examines each case on its merits. I cannot pre-empt what the minister will decide, if and when any application for exemption comes in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of the question about whether or not we should move to a total ban, I have no indication or understanding from the minister that we will be doing that. In terms of repealing section 18, which allows the minister to grant exemptions, the intention of that is merely to protect Australia from losing sponsorship of significant international events when there will be a possible loss of revenue to this country. I have no advice that there is any intention to change the act in regard to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether or not we should move to a total ban, it is clearly a matter for further considered community attitude and discussion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. I refer to a number of significant APEC trade and investment gatherings held earlier this month in Indonesia. Reports suggest that the meetings were among the more positive that APEC has held. Is the minister in a position to outline the progress which has been achieved to date by APEC? Could he advise the Senate on the prospects for APEC delivering concrete results this year in the areas of trade and investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Loosley for the question and for his continuing interest in the subject. The APEC meetings to which Senator Loosley referred were both very important: the committee on trade and investment and the senior officers meetings held in Indonesia from 16 to 20 May. They have been reported to me by the officers who attended as amongst the most productive to date, particularly on trade and investment issues. The suggestions from those officers are that this was significantly enhanced by the very significant job which Indonesia did in hosting these meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meetings confirmed that there is a significant opportunity for all of the members of APEC, and for Australia as one of them, to record a series of positive steps in APEC's development this year. The meetings confirmed considerable forward movement on Australian priorities, such as investment and standards. Progress was made on a draft agenda for the APEC trade ministers meeting in October, which will aim to lay the base for steps to remove impediments to trade in the region. APEC leaders' representatives had a very fruitful discussion about the second leaders meeting, which Indonesia will host in November, the outcome of which will be very important for the region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These meetings were important in general terms, but I would like to refer, in response to Senator Loosley's question, to some specifics. There was important progress on the Australian Prime Minister's initiative on investment, with the basis having been established for agreement on a non-binding set of APEC investment principles before November. Principles under discussion cover key investment themes, such as national treatment, non-discrimination and transparency. There were very constructive discussions amongst APEC investment experts. There was a tentative set of draft principles assembled by Australia and a small group of other members. We are quite optimistic that a more formal draft document will emerge from a further meeting in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's draft framework to guide APEC's work on standards was also adopted. There was agreement on a substantial work program, with the ultimate aim of reducing the cost of duplicate testing and differing standards in the region, which could have a very significant impact on trade within the region. It is a very significant trade enhancing impact and it will be very good for living standards of Australians and other citizens of the region. Agreement was also reached on terms of reference for APEC's work on customs and a breakthrough was made on a proposal for a tariff database pilot project which has potential significance to be of great value to the APEC business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impressive progress achieved at these meetings reflected increased involvement and commitment by APEC members, and this has been reinforced by the desire of the region's leaders to identify themselves so closely with APEC's future. It is evident also that, with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, regional governments are now focusing on how to pursue regional economic integration more effectively. I think these are important trends, important to Australia's trade future and important to the economic development future of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key development during the year will be the second APEC leaders' meeting in November in Indonesia and the associated annual ministerial meeting. We think there is a very real prospect arising from the meetings to which Senator Loosley referred that leaders will be well placed to set out at that meeting a vision for APEC's future, focusing on cooperative economic integration in our region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. The minister will be aware that the CSIRO operates a system of priority areas of research which attract funding over and above other fields in two ways: firstly, via CSIRO's general budget allocations; and, secondly, by access to a special pool of funds reserved for priority research areas. The minister will also be aware that the priority areas for the next triennium are mining, telecommunications, information technology and small business which, by CSIRO's own definition, effectively excludes primary industry. Does the minister agree with CSIRO's judgment that primary industry, which earns about one-quarter of Australia's export income, does not warrant a high priority for research funding?</PARA></TALK.START>

We appoint a board to the CSIRO of eminent scientists and other leading citizens in Australia to guide the selection of science priorities for the country. We do not interfere with the CSIRO's choices, although there is a degree of trust and confidence between the board and the government. We do exchange views about the priorities expressed, but the decisions in the end are the decisions of the CSIRO.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have to trust the judgment of people who know where the frontiers are to advise us and take decisions about those priorities. In answering this question, nothing in my answer should be taken as meaning that we do not place a high degree of importance upon research in agriculture and agricultural-related industries. Agriculture clearly is one of the major industries and exports of this country. Priorities of research in that field are vitally important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of questions running together there. So far as the bottom line about aggregate family allowances is concerned, the government has made its position clear in the budget. We have gone as far as we can go, for the moment anyway, in terms of family assistance. That record is one, as I said earlier, that any government can be proud of. Certainly we have been very concerned not just to talk the rhetoric of the family but to provide the wherewithal for families to survive and expand their purchasing capacity through the various strategies to assist the family that we have adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is the case that for substantial economic recovery to occur, the benefits of which will be felt by every section of the community, the key is growth in the economy stimulated by demand by increases of one means or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to improve, with our overall strategy both macro-economic and micro-economic, Australian competitiveness to the point where we can not only operate in an import substitution fashion but also, of course, penetrate, on an even greater scale than we have been doing so successfully in recent years, export markets including, in particular, in our own part of the world. The key to growth is exports and we are putting in place all the policies which are necessary to produce that result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the point at which Senator Harradine began about the general effectiveness of the strategy in the white paper, it focuses on a number of different things&mdash;investment encouragement, infrastructure, small and medium businesses and trade enhancement measures&mdash;but the centrepiece is the job compact and the job training part of it. As the government was at pains to point out, this is not just simply a social justice measure, not just simply an equity measure as important as it may be in that respect and not just simply looking after people in the short period; it is creating a capacity for long term growth in the Australian economy by removing inflationary bottlenecks and ensuring that we have a supply of well trained labour to meet those shortages as they undoubtedly will arise in the future and thereby ensuring, through the contribution of those who become employed one after another, that the economy as a whole will grow further as a result.</PARA>

I could go on and on, yet Senator Minchin wants to suggest that those payments are not good things for families. They are, and they are welcomed by the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me pick up on some of the answers which my colleagues have been giving in this place yesterday and today: the recognition by this government of the importance of targeting its payments to people in need and people with children. Those payments have been increased and targeted since we came into office. We have set benchmarks for payments for children. These are matters of great importance and worthy of great celebration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that some people out there do not necessarily understand all of the advantages that they are entitled to is a matter of continuing concern, a matter of why this government is at pains to make sure, as much as possible, that we advertise very widely exactly what the benefits are to those likely to be eligible in the community. That is precisely why we have an extensive campaign running at the moment to try to make people aware of the cash rebate for child care before 1 July 1994 so that those payments can cut in the minute the cash rebate starts.</PARA>

One could never say that one is sure that everybody in the community knows. It is a matter of continuing concern.

The government presides over the most complex system of payments imaginable&mdash;the basic family payment, the additional family payment, the parenting allowance, child-care assistance, child-care rebate and now the home child-care allowance. If, as Martin Ferguson quite rightly says, one needs a doctorate to follow this maze, how on earth can ordinary Australians be expected to understand this bureaucratic smorgasbord of benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is remarkable how many people do benefit and it is remarkable how many people are getting those payments. Senator Minchin's claim contradicts the number of people who are in receipt of payments by this government. We can be particularly proud of these very large payments. They are targeted payments, they are focused and thousands of Australians enjoy those benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we should be cautious about the extent to which a maze out there prevents people from understanding what they are entitled to.

Various reports contained in those media reports made allegations of secrecy and of mistreatment by the department of immigration and its officers.

Can he explain to the Senate and to the people of Australia what arrangements are made for the settlement of successful refugee applicants in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for this question and for the opportunity to set the record straight on an issue which is quite often misrepresented and sensationalised in the Australian media. The people to whom Senator McKiernan refers are 14 Cambodian boat people. They were granted refugee status on 16 May. These families had originally been refused refugee status. They made fresh applications in late February, just a few months ago, and on the basis of the new information in these fresh applications they achieved refugee status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate arrangements having been made by my department for their settlement in the Australian community, the families left Port Hedland, as Senator McKiernan says, on 27 May to travel to Perth. Media coverage in respect of the journey to Perth, including the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">TV News</EMPHASIS> on Saturday night and Duncan Graham's story in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, included some totally unfounded allegations&mdash;allegations that departmental officers deliberately gave out misleading information about their travel arrangements and that they failed to provide meals en route to Perth and allegations about the conditions in the Port Hedland centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the travel arrangements for people released from detention are not normally publicly announced. There was no disinformation provided to the press. As I am informed, no-one from the media was given any information about travel movements. The pick-up point in Port Hedland and the drop-off point in Perth were changed at the request of the head of the largest family group amongst the Cambodian people when he learnt that the media were expected to be in attendance. That person is the father of the two children quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A departmental officer in Perth was telephoned and asked for travel details by a person claiming to be calling on behalf of a relative of two of the group. He was advised only that the group was on the bus and that it would follow its normal route, terminating at the east Perth bus terminal. The people were not smuggled from the Port Hedland centre. They were free to contact the media from the time they left the centre. Friends who wanted to farewell them from Port Hedland were able to travel to the new departure point in good time to see them before they left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the second point of misinformation, ABC News on Saturday night reported that the media purchased food for the group during a stop in the north-west town of Dampier. If they did so in the belief that the Cambodians did not have any money or food, they were mistaken. The group took enough food from the Port Hedland centre for their entire journey to Perth. In addition, each of the families had adequate funds of its own for any purchases en route. The department does provide limited funds only to those without their own resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the claims about uncertainty involved in the move to Perth, there was no such uncertainty. The group was fully briefed on what to expect in Perth by a Cambodian interpreter who had stayed in similar accommodation in Perth. The President of the Indo-China Refugee Association, Marion Le, is quoted as saying that the transportation arrangements were `another example of the dehumanising and undignified manner in which these people are treated'. This was in Duncan Graham's article as well. This suggestion, like many of Marion Le's, is hysterical nonsense. As I have already pointed out, the arrangements were put in place at the request of the head of the largest family within the group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on, but my time is running out. I should say that conditions within the detention centre have been investigated by a number of people, including the members of Senator McKiernan's parliamentary committee. I refute the points made that adequate food is not provided. In fact, I can assure honourable senators that detainees receive a proper diet in terms of nutrition, quality and quantity. It would help all of us in this debate if the media once in a while actually checked their facts and got it right.</PARA>

Does the minister now recognise that to allow HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> to remain open with a reduced complement of personnel would have provided the greatest net savings to the government and will he instigate action to ensure that this occurs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence at the estimates committee hearing indicated nothing of the sort. I also point out to Senator Calvert that we are talking about year on year costs, not a one-off saving. Even on his assumption, it would be more logical to spend $250,000 in one year to save $140,000 year on year. Nevertheless, the closing of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> enabled us to restructure staff far more extensively than if we had left the base where it is. The fact is that two years ago the navy looked at building up a hurt list if the budget were reduced. It found that the three most expendable areas are the three bases we are closing. It was the navy's choice of priorities, not the government's. We accepted its recommendation, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> will close in June and I will not be reconsidering the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

I must add that I have had a large volume of correspondence from senators, members, members of state parliaments and a great many individuals in the community about the publicity that was given to this by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> some weeks ago. At my request, the welfare of these pups was discussed at a recent meeting of the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Senator Evans, upon notice, on 30 May 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Minister advise of the current status of Australia's $6 million involvement in aid for the proposed Mindoro College of Agriculture and Technology in the Philippines?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, has provided me with the following answer to The Honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $15 million five year agricultural technology education project (Agritech) commenced on 1 September, 1993. It is designed to help strengthen the capacity of eleven Philippine agricultural colleges, by training college staff, improving curricula, providing essential equipment and funding income-earning projects and scholarships for poor students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mindoro College was selected as one of those eleven institutions because it has good development potential and serves a poor isolated region where well-trained farm advisers and farmer leaders could do much to enhance the wellbeing of local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a longstanding land tenure dispute between Mindoro College and local settlers. While the college land where the farmers are settled is not required for Agritech project activities, the advent of the project has led to an escalation of the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suspended assistance to the Mindoro College under the Agritech project, for a period of 12 months, from January 1994 to enable a settlement to be reached between the Government of the Philippines, the college and the settlers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be inappropriate for Australian aid to be associated with an institution where a dispute of this kind is occurring, even though it is entirely unrelated to the proposed Australian aid activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been informed by staff at the Embassy, who are monitoring the situation, that dialogue between the settlers, the college and the Government of the Philippines is continuing but resolution of the problem has yet to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government would not support the forced removal of settlers for an aid project to proceed. However, the Agritech project does not require the use of the land which the settlers currently occupy and the project, if it were to proceed, would not in any way involve the removal of farmers from college land. Nevertheless the Australian Government's wish is that the dispute be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.</PARA>

I suspect that, given that the two women in question are on charges and the matter has been publicly aired, the people involved in them have ceased&mdash;or at least I would hope that they have ceased&mdash;the particular conduct in question. So of course there is probably no AFP investigation at this point in time, but it does not mean that there was no AFP investigation at an earlier date. It does not mean that the AFP did not have a surveillance team monitoring the senior federal politician in his cavorting with the prostitutes, as is alleged, because that is not something the minister has answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that the NCA and the AFP are not investigating this particular matter. That does not mean that the AFP does not have other investigations ongoing or has not had for the last four years an ongoing investigation into particular organised crime figures, which happens to have overlapped with incidents which surround this problem. There is nothing in Senator Bolkus's answer that denies the fact that there has been an AFP investigation for four years which somehow seems to have involved a senior Labor politician. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters are very serious. It is not sufficient for Senator Bolkus to come before this parliament and say that we have no right to ask these questions. We have every right to ask these questions because the circumstances surrounding these matters suggest criminality and corruption. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the advice I have had consistently and up to the moment from both the AFP and the NCA through the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is that there is no such ongoing investigation and, as a consequence, if there is no investigation no-one can be interfering with the conduct of such an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look closely at what Senator O'Chee says. He says there might be a prima facie offence which was a breach of state law. No-one has denied that the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland may be investigating matters there. The fact that there may be a prima facie case which was a breach of state law is no responsibility of this government. State law is state law; federal law is federal law. If there is no joint investigation, we have no role in it. He goes on to say that I have not made it clear that there is no AFP involvement. I have made it clear: the AFP is not investigating prostitution on the Gold Coast. But on it goes. Every angle he tries to bring into it is an angle of innuendo and smear. I think it behoves him to have a bit of a memory on these sorts of matters and listen to what the government is saying in response to his question today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Boswell's question about the NCA, I have placed it all on the record. In response to questions about the AFP obtaining briefings, investigating and whatever, I have put that on the record as well. I do not know what the guys opposite from the National Party are really on about with this issue. God knows that if any group of individuals in this country has suffered police investigation and trials, it has been their former colleagues in Queensland. At one stage the whole cabinet used to meet in the Boggo Road goal in Queensland&mdash;and for good reason; they were all convicted. They know that. Senator Boswell understands this.

I made it perfectly clear in the first question I asked on the matter&mdash;which did not name anybody&mdash;and I think it was asked of Senator Gareth Evans. The question I asked was based on this: a report had come to me that the National Crime Authority, or the Australian Federal Police, or both were investigating organised crime in Australia. In the process of that investigation there was a by-product&mdash;the by-product to which Senator Bolkus has now referred. It related to a state matter which was the observance of a senior ALP figure being involved with prostitutes on the Gold Coast on a number of occasions&mdash;not  just one occasion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I understand that the majority view is that this matter should be considered by the Committee of Privileges and not debated to conclusion here, and on that basis the government will not oppose the formal motion now being put. But, on behalf of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, I wish to make clear for the record from the outset the points that Mr Brereton will be relying on before the privileges committee. They are as follows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Mr Roger Boland was never the preferred candidate of the government for appointment as vice-president, enterprise bargaining division, of the AIRC. Secondly, at no stage, either before or after Mr Boland's appearance at the Senate committee, was there any commitment given or intent to appoint Mr Boland to this position. His name was put forward by the MTIA and he was one of many candidates considered by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the assertion by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that the Minister for Industrial Relations indicated to Mr Boland that he was a `plum for the job' were words never used by the minister. Fourthly, as Mr Boland was never the preferred candidate for appointment, it is totally false for the member for Bennelong to assert that he had either been punished or dumped as alleged in the House on 3 May, and subsequently by Senator Crane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, to the contrary, Mr Boland's employer, Mr Bert Evans, chief executive of the MTIA, was specifically advised that Mr Boland was considered suitable for appointment as a deputy president of the AIRC, but not as the vice-president, enterprise bargaining. Mr Evans advised that Mr Boland had rejected an earlier government offer of appointment as a deputy president and was only interested in becoming vice-president, enterprise bargaining. This consultation with Mr Evans in fact followed Mr Boland's appearance before the Senate committee. Mr Evans was advised that Mr Boland would continue to be considered favourably as a candidate for a deputy president's position. Accordingly, it is quite false to assert that he was penalised for his comments at the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, Mr Bert Evans and Mr Roger Boland completely endorse these points that have been made on Mr Brereton's behalf. These are the points that will be made on Mr Brereton's behalf if the matter is referred to the privileges committee. I have no doubt that, as a result, the complaint will be found to have no substance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I served on the industry, science and infrastructure committee and we also had a matter of privilege to deal with on the application of a person who believed that he was affected. He wrote to the committee with detailed evidence of his claim with regard to his having suffered a loss of benefit as a result of giving evidence to a public hearing of that committee. The government members of the committee had great difficulty in getting the support of the opposition members&mdash;in fact, the opposition members opposed it all the way&mdash;in seeking to have the matter referred to the privileges committee. Yet, when Senator Crane raised this matter in the education, employment and training committee he did so only on the basis of a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. There was no complaint from the individual concerned. Senator Crane did not have a complaint that he had received personally.

I hope that Senator Crane takes the same stand the next time when I or any member of the government seeks to raise a matter of privilege. All I am saying is that we ought to deal with the facts here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis that no complaint had been received from the individual concerned, the committee found that there was no matter for it to deal with. That did not stop Senator Crane from bringing the matter before the Senate, which he has done. However, it is important that we understand the context in which Senator Crane brought that matter here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 3 March 1994, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans indicated the Government would provide the Parliament with a report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Auditor-General in his Report No 9 of 1993-94&mdash;"An efficiency audit of the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program" administered by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts following its review of that Report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to other portfolios, the Department of Finance sought information from each portfolio department regarding grants programs that might be considered to be similar to the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Programs under which grants are paid to individuals, organisations or other governments where the payments are permissive or discretionary (ie, the Commonwealth is not compelled to pay the grants to particular recipients or classes of recipients in accordance with the requirements of statutory criteria or contractual obligations);</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to (a), departments informed the Department of Finance of the programs listed in the attached Schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to (b), Senators will appreciate that the diversity of programs under which the Commonwealth provides assistance by way of grants is such that the recommendations both of the Auditor-General and the House of Representatives Standing Committee will not necessarily all apply directly or uniformly to every program. Departments have indicated however, that the procedures governing the approval of grants under all the listed programs generally meet the recommendations insofar as they are relevant to the programs administered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to (c), departments have indicated that for programs that do not completely conform to the reports' recommendations, it is because either the recommendation was specific to the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program, or was otherwise not relevant or applicable, or that further work was required to assess the relevance of the recommendations to particular programs. In all of the latter cases departments plan to review the administration of each program to adopt, where practicable, the Auditor-General's recommendations. The Department of Finance was not advised of any programs that failed to conform to the recommendations of the Auditor-General, and were not being assessed with a view to making them conform.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORT NO. 9 OF 1993-94</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Cultural, Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department agrees with, and will implement in line with the ANAO's best practice manual, those recommendations (1-8, 11-13 and 15-16) which in part, at least, refer to a future program if there were to be such a program. The only exceptions are the elements of recommendations 1 and 2 which would have the effect of limiting the number of applications received and restricting applications to larger projects. That is a matter for Government decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those recommendations which impact on the current Program, the following comments are provided&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department accepts this recommendation and now writes to grant recipients regularly during the course of their projects, monitoring among other things: commencement of, and progress with, projects; funding from other sources; likely claim points; and compliance with grant conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is accepted. Resources have been provided to the Office of Sport and Recreation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is accepted. The Department's fraud control plan has recently been revised and comment has been provided by the Attorney-General's Department. As part of this process, the fraud control strategies relating to this Program have been revised (an appendix to the broader Departmental plan) and have been approved by the Department's Internal Auditor. These measures have been incorporated as part of Program management and the plan will shortly be submitted for formal Ministerial approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation will be taken into account in advice to be put to the Minister on the proposed evaluation of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDING COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, RECREATION AND THE ARTS. REVIEW OF THE EFFICIENCY AUDIT BY THE AUDITOR GENERAL INTO THE COMMUNITY CULTURAL, RECREATION AND SPORTING FACILITIES PROGRAM.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its report to the Parliament, the Standing Committee noted that the former Minister had accepted the Auditor-General's findings and it was of the view that, provided the Auditor-General's recommendations were adopted, any future program would be better administered and ministerial decisions would be more accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee saw little need to add to the Auditor-General's recommendations. However, it proposed five measures "to ensure that in the future the program can be adequately monitored by the parliament."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The five recommendations all refer to the extension of the current program, or the implementation of a future program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will not be extending the present program beyond 30 June 1995, nor will it be introducing a new program in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from payments under the current program which will continue to be made until the end of June 1995, the Commonwealth's only commitment to assist with the development of sporting facilities in the near future is the $150 million provided for facilities at Homebush Bay for the 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the immediate future the Government will be concentrating on the human aspects of sport&mdash;on achievement and attainment of personal goals by athletes&mdash;rather than bricks and mortar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of community facilities can be safely left to State, Territory and local governments to provide, especially given that the Commonwealth has provided some $60 million for this purpose through the sports portfolio since 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would therefore be appropriate for the Standing Committee's recommendations to be more fully considered if, and when, a sport and recreation facilities program is reintroduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, however, the five recommendations, and the Government's response to them, are listed below:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) before any new round of funding is commenced, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories analyse the need for cultural, recreational and sporting facilities, to provide a basis for the allocation of funds to proposed projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation is accepted in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not question the need for additional and improved sport and recreation facilities&mdash;rather it seeks to provide decision making based on "measures of comparative regional need".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While accepting the principle, the Government is not able at this time to commit itself to the form this analysis might take. It is no simple task to develop a national inventory of existing sport and recreation facilities and to overlap this with some form of needs assessment. At the very least, it would require close collaboration with State, Territory and local government and a variety of community and regional sport and recreation organisations as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) in all future grants programs where the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories selects projects to receive grants, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories ought to provide a schedule of applications that evaluates the proposed projects and contains recommendations to guide the Minister's decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) the grant application form be redesigned to allow the proposed projects to be numerically rated against each of the selection criteria and that the criteria be weighted so that an overall rating can be calculated for each application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepted in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of some form of more formalised assessment and a rating system is acknowledged and accepted. The most appropriate mechanism for achieving this, however, would depend on the guidelines and selection criteria for any new program and could only be decided upon at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) the numerical ratings against the individual criteria and the overall rating be included in schedules of applications provided to the Minister and that the Minister consider these ratings when making decisions about which applications to fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) where additional information is obtained and the ratings are amended by the Minister, or if for any other reasons the ratings are amended, the schedules should be annotated and the additional information added to the file.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts the thrust of the Standing Committee's report and undertakes to introduce appropriate mechanisms to provide a more objective selection process should a new program be introduced at some future time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Standing Committee has, in effect, endorsed the Audit Office's recommendations, it is appropriate to outline action taken to date by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories in implementing those of the ANAO's recommendations that relate to the current program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) ANAO recommends that the Department:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">develop a more systematic categorisation process;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">document the justification for allocating priorities;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has placed all records which it has retained on formal files, including all notes relating to the categorisation process for 1992-93 projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8)ANAO recommends that the Department pay more attention to monitoring the progress of projects, the ability of applicants to manage projects and to have other funding in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9)ANAO recommends that the Department review the staffing requirements of the program in light of the need for adequate accountability and project approval, monitoring and reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff resources allocated to the Program have been <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">supplemented to ensure more comprehensive monitoring of the progress of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New procedures have also been introduced to assist in the monitoring process. Existing mechanisms have been strengthened by a more regular and comprehensive follow-up system; time-frames for responses to Department inquiries have been introduced; more regular financial reporting is in place; payment procedures have been tightened to ensure that funds from other sources are spent concurrently with Commonwealth funds; and staff are commencing to visit projects when possible to see that grant conditions are being met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) ANAO recommends that the Department revise its fraud control plan for the CCRSF program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's fraud control plan has recently been reviewed and updated and will be presented for Ministerial approval shortly. However, the section relating to the CCRSFP was updated late last year and is operational.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) ANAO recommends that the terms of reference for the review (of the effectiveness of the program in 1994) include:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was back in 1990 when he dealt with Western Australia specifically. But, worse than that, in the run-up to the last election, following many years of continual complaint, I had included as part of the opposition's approach to the election a clear statement that this program was so dishonest, so blatantly crooked, so disgraceful that it would not feature in a coalition government, that we would cancel this program, we would end it, we would finish it off because it was not a sports program, it was a vote-buying shonk. It was the illegitimate creature of former Senator Richardson, I suppose one could say, brought into the world in a more developed state by Mrs Kelly, but that might involve some curious analogies. But we could say this: if Mrs Kelly was the monkey then former Senator Richardson was certainly the organ-grinder&mdash;a phrase which could have some curious connotations at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly angry about the fact that my proposal, as shadow minister for sport, to get rid of this dishonest program&mdash;subsequently proved to be dishonest&mdash;was attacked violently by the people opposite who, as a result of this deception among many other deceptions, bought their way back into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having moved that the Senate take note of this document, I note one particular part of it especially and that is the quote in the government response, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will not be extending the present program beyond 30 June 1995, nor will it be introducing a new program in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to explain why. It says that in the immediate future the government will be concentrating on the human aspects of sport, on achievement and attainment of personal goals by athletes rather than bricks and mortar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am wondering who wrote this stuff. Did he or she just take it out of my pre-election sports statement? This is exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to make certain that government money went to sportspeople, not to political stunts like this one. Is it not amazing? After the election, after it had done its work, this shonky scheme has been dropped by this government because even it could not stand the smell of the sports rorts still hanging around its neck. In fact, as former Senator Walsh pointed out, many of these vote purchasing schemes have more negatives than positives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate thing is, of course, that the positives for this government took place before the election and the negatives after it. What a shame that that happened because on this side of the chamber, we&mdash;and certainly me in particular&mdash;were all complaining about this project, pointing out its dishonesty, long before the election. But, I am afraid, the press gallery could not have cared less&mdash;we could not get a line. It was fortunate that the Auditor-General, who attended and continues to attend Senate estimates meetings, thank heavens, became aware of this issue, the dishonest nature of these grants and the deceptions by the ministers involved when they were pretending that guidelines were being met when they were not. It was only because the Auditor-General picked up this ball, as his responsibility, and ran with it that it became an issue that attracted the press gallery and therefore the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences were that the minister who had misled the parliament on this matter `resigned'. I can remember the document that Mrs Kelly put out before the last election attacking me, my policy and the statements that I had put out&mdash;the very sound and sensible document showing how sport would benefit under a coalition government&mdash;saying it was a disgrace that we were taking money away from sport. It is funny, I have not heard Mrs Kelly say anything about the fact that the government will not be extending the present program, that it is killing it off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why, before the last election, Mrs Kelly found any suggestion that we would cut it off to be so disgraceful, but when her own government ends it, there is nothing wrong. The silent Mrs Kelly, who was so voluble before the election, but who has been utterly silent after it now that this shonky project that she maladministered has been cut off: we do not hear any complaint from her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One gets accustomed to the sorts of deception and dishonesty that took place on behalf of this government in the run up to the last election. We all know that the anti-GST campaign was probably the most dishonest that any of us have struck. But I think that many sports people have forgotten the level of dishonesty in a government which protested about ending a program when we proposed it before the election, and then did what we proposed after the election. I am surprised that the government did not find some greater excuse for doing so, but it probably assumed that it could lie its way out of this one, as it has lied its way out of other issues. It did not even show a flicker of embarrassment, but I suppose it should not because it has become so expert at misleading the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember exactly what this report of the Auditor-General, to which the government has responded, is all about. Before doing that, I point out that this shonky and dishonest program that the government has run on and off since 1988 was to have been evaluated, according to the government's response, before the government would consider its possible continuation. The response says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the Program is not to be extended or a similar program introduced in the foreseeable future, and the Program has been thoroughly scrutinised by the Auditor-General, it is not now intended to undertake a further evaluation of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA>I will bet it is not. The last thing this government would want would be any kind of thorough evaluation of this program. We know it is a shonky program. The Auditor-General has certainly established that in the making of the grants there was behaviour which was a disgrace in the sense there was a lack of documentation and an openness to fraud, but we do not know about the implementation of the program. The Auditor-General has not reported on the implementation of the program because the program has not finished being implemented. In fact, it is being rolled over again until the end of the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the next disgraceful and dishonest element of this shonky dishonest deal. Every year the government would put out in its budget a statement, `This is the wonderful, huge total we are going to spend on sport this year.' It would include multi-millions under this program. Come the end of the year, that money would not have been spent. So it would go onto the next budget. And, having falsely claimed it was going to spend $80-odd million, it would spend $6 million less&mdash;it would spend, say, $74 million, and these are not precise figures but just an indication. The following year the government would get up and say, `Whacko. This year we are going to increase our spending to $80 million.' It would include again in its dishonest polemic the same money being rolled over and over and over; the same money claimed to have been spent on sport but not being spent that year at all being pushed forward to other years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the same thing this year. I think something like $6 1/2 million which was supposed to have been spent in the 1993-94 financial year will now be spent in 1994-95. In this budget the government is claiming it is going to spend $13 1/2 million under this project, except that it is double claiming $6 1/2 million that should have been spent in the current year to June. It is dishonesty upon dishonesty, shonk upon shonk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the Auditor-General's report has effectively forced the government into cancelling this disgraceful program that all ministers of this government embraced for years as something they saw no problem with or objected to&mdash;at least, not outside&mdash;and which they used as a weapon to beat us over the head with when we were honest before the last election. All ministers in this government stand condemned for their silence on this disgraceful matter. It was brought to their attention often enough in this chamber, going back to 1990. They knew it perfectly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I  often  wonder  whether  ex-Senator Richardson's earlier than anticipated retirement from this chamber had anything to do with the fact that we gave him fair notice that we were going to pursue every one of the disgraceful grants that took place when he was the minister. Although, I must say that he was a little more clever about it than Mrs Kelly. In his case he did not ask the department to categorise them and to put them in some order of priority. He did nothing like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember his response in a Senate estimates committee when I asked him what happened about notifying these things, and what role did the department play. His response was simple, direct and politically astute. He said, `If a grant is awarded I write the letter to them. If a grant request is knocked back then the department writes them, and that is the role of the department.' That means that ex-Senator Richardson would not be capable of falling into the ridiculous situation that Mrs Kelly fell into where she denied in the parliament that various grants had not filled the requirements of the grant conditions. She denied, for example, that there had been late grants. Obviously, if ministers are running everything themselves and do not have the department participating, they can get away with what they like and no-one would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly, having involved the department, then left herself open to attack when she misled the parliament about the propriety or not and the status of various applications. Nonetheless, it was clear to ex-Senator Richardson that he was going to face months of non-stop flack over quite proper criticism of his sports rorts deal. The whole concept of federal involvement in facilities began under Mr John Brown, the minister for having a good time, and pigs. Mr John Brown decided that it would be a good idea, and many people supported this concept, if large national projects were funded by the national government&mdash;projects which would increase the capacity in Australia for international performance; for example, a swimming pool in Hobart which I know is close to Senator Calvert's heart but has not been funded. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO considers that it is in the interest of a Minister to document the reasons for individual decisions to allay such allegations and to provide accountability for decisions . . . ANAO found that the Department's administration of the program was weak:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result ANAO is not able to report that the program is an efficient and effective use of public money.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! We told this government that, and we have been telling it that for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get a feeling of the size of it. This program had its origins in the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program approved in the 1988-89 budget when the government agreed to provide $13 million over three years. In the 1991-92 budget the government extended it for a further three years at a cost of $30 million. Then in November 1992, when it found that it could not spend its money under the shonky One Nation statement, it reallocated this money, and it reallocated just under $19 million into this program. That is something like $62 million that has been spent on this vote buying program since 1988-89. In fact, in something like three years $62 million was allocated to this vote buying shonk of a program. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the original program was to assist State and local government authorities to make up the backlog in the provision of basic sporting and recreational facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we find in this report the Auditor-General complaining that there had not been adequate cooperation, discussion and agreement with local government bodies. It is just incredible. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over the detail because it has been gone over often enough. We know that a bigger proportion of those grant applications which did not meet the criteria were granted approval than were those that met the top grade of criteria and, of course, the key criteria to this government was what electorate the application was in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, a great number of the recommendations put up by the Auditor-General have been accepted by the government, but it seems to have knocked back the proposal that the number of applications received should be limited and restricted to larger projects. In other words, going back to the John Brown concept and saying that it is a matter for government decision. As the government has decided not to proceed with this program anyway, I suppose we can say that it does not really matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does matter is that the Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of a number of official inquiries in recent years, in particular, the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland, the WA Inc Royal Commission in Western Australia and the State Bank inquiry in South Australia point to the risks to the public interest of a system of government where there is no effective accountability of those trusted with public power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are terribly important words. They underline the need for there to be a powerful and effective Auditor-General, because it is the Auditor-General who, in this case, has pointed publicly and effectively to the fact that there was no effective accountability of those trusted with public power, and those people misused their status, their power and the public purse to buy votes in this situation. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key principles underlying Australian constitutional arrangements is that the institutions and agencies of government and officials (elected and non-elected) exist to serve the interests of the public. If public confidence in Government is to be maintained public officials&mdash;who act in trust on behalf of all citizens&mdash;must ensure that their actions and decisions, however unintentionally, do nothing to allow any suspicion that official power and position is being used for self-interested or partisan purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public power and public resources are delegated to governments which are expected to act in the national interest. The use of public resources contributed by force of law, not voluntarily, by taxpayers requires particular care in ensuring that defensible conduct can be demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA>In passing he also notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without proper records the program will always be susceptible to allegations of impropriety.</PARA>
<PARA>That important matter that there must be effective accountability underlines the fact that this chamber must not allow the Keating government to emasculate the Auditor-General, to deprive him of the resources that would enable him to keep pointing out disgraceful conduct like this lack of proper accountability and to leave a situation where he says he cannot disprove the proposition that this was a political stunt, and a disgraceful one at that. I commend the Auditor-General once again. I am glad the government has responded by accepting at least the bulk of the Auditor-General's recommendations. I think it ought to accept them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by saying what a shame it is that the government government's decision&mdash;or admission as it is now really&mdash;is that this program is to end. What a shame that decision was not announced before the last election. What a shame the government did not have the integrity to front up to the Australian people and say that it would not be continued. What a shame the government did not have the guts to say that in the foreseeable future there would be no such program. What a shonky lot. What a disgraceful group of people who denied the Australian people the right to make a proper judgment on them by delaying until now the statement that this program, which is dishonest to the poor and which they defended to the hilt, was not going to proceed once they had conned the Australian people into voting for them. </PARA>

We have some excellent sporting facilities in this country but very few are in regional areas and away from the major capital cities. We need some major facilities to ensure that potential athletes and elite athletes in particular do not have to travel literally thousands of miles to be able to undertake the fundamental training that is required if they are to reach the top of their sport both in Australia and internationally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Something that we have probably read many times, Senator Calvert, and have in all our libraries. He helped to popularise the term. In chapter one, entitled `The Pork Barrel', Hale wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We find that, when an extraordinary contingency arises in life, as just now in ours, we have only to go to our pork barrel, and the fish rises to our hook or spear.</PARA>
<PARA>The term was widely used by the early 1900s. By the 1870s, congressmen were regularly referring to `pork' and the word became part of the US political lexicon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time</EMPHASIS> Magazine noted in 1948 that one Peter J. McGuinness:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . fished in Tammany's pork barrel for 28 years to bring improvements to `me people.'</PARA>
<PARA>In a Baltimore speech on inflation in 1952, Adlai Stevenson pledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no pork-barrelling while our economy is in its present condition.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a shame that one Paul Keating did not pledge to have `no pork-barrelling' while we were in the middle of a recession. The whole of Australia was in a recession during the sports rorts grants but that did not stop Paul Keating from spending $60 million of taxpayers' money&mdash;borrowed money; actually bankcard money&mdash;on this pork-barrelling scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are informed by a Mr C.C. Maxey that the phrase `pork barrel' refers to the practice of periodically distributing salt pork to slaves from large barrels. In the 1919 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Municipal Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator Calvert has probably read this one, too&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oftentimes the eagerness of the slaves would result in a rush upon the pork barrel, in which each would strive to grab as much as possible for himself. Members of Congress in the stampede to get their local appropriation items into the omnibus river and harbor bills behaved so much like Negro slaves rushing to the pork barrel, that these bills were facetiously styled "pork barrel" bills, and the system which originated them as thus become known as the pork-barrel system.</PARA>
<PARA>The sports rorts program prior to the last election became the biggest pork barrel in Australian political history. We saw nearly $50 million handed out in just two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister made some comments about the importance of using these facilities for the Olympics. To put that $50 million into context, this government has appropriated in this year's budget $20 million to find and train olympic athletes. This year and next year the government is giving less money to increasing participation in olympic sports, identifying olympic athletes and training those olympic athletes than it gave in the last two years to its political pork barrel sports rorts program. So that is the government's commitment to the Olympics. More money went to the sports rorts affair last year than is going to our olympic athletes this year. Let us get into perspective the Labor Party's commitment to the Olympics. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the accountability package because in the long term this will be of vital interest to Australia. We were told on 3 March when the government was trying to stop Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens from voting for a Senate select committee inquiry into the sports rorts affair that there would be a whole range of accountability measures. I have the speech in front of me and I have highlighted some of the legs of those measures that need to be reviewed constantly. I committed to the Senate then that I would keep these measures under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans came in here to try to assure my colleagues on the crossbenches that we did not need a Senate select committee inquiry into the sports rorts affair because this government was finally, after 11 years of mismanagement and closed and unaccountable government, all of a sudden going to turn over a new leaf. I doubted its sincerity. I am certain that the Democrat senators, the Green senators and Senator Harradine will also keep under close scrutiny the Leader of the Government's commitments to the Senate on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget brought down only a fortnight ago we saw one of the first commitments of the Leader of the Government fall over in one hit. Senator Evans referred to a whole range of measures to upgrade the office of Auditor-General, to make it more independent and to ensure that its resources were secure. He said that the ANAO would be getting a comprehensive, single line budget; that the Audit Office would be mandated as the sole auditor of all government departments, statutory authorities and GBEs without exception; and that the Auditor-General would become an statutory officer of the parliament and a separate statutory authority. These are all things that will be in the new audit act that we are yet to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the entire speech he gave the illusion that he was going to ensure that the Auditor-General was well resourced. He undertook, on behalf of the government, that he would review the forward estimates and funding for the audit office for 1994-95&mdash;we have just had the budget for 1994-95&mdash;following the outcome of an inquiry into the conduct of officers and departments in the so-called Centenary House affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised in the Senate, I think on 11 May, in a question to Senator Evans, why, if he has given such a commitment to fund the Auditor-General, have its funds been slashed by $10 million in this budget? That is a massive slashing to an organisation that has only a relatively meagre budget already. </PARA>
<PARA>The minister replied that it is all okay; that it is all to do with some changes in accounting, a few redundancies and a few abnormal items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not happy with that response. I was very pleased that my colleague, Senator Parer, who is in the chamber today, decided to pursue that matter in estimates last week. He asked the officers from the Australian National Audit Office what was the state of their funding for this year. Was Senator Evans right, in other words? Had I made a fundamental mistake about the financing of the Auditor-General's office this year? Was it all a bookkeeping mistake that I could not work out because I just did not understand?  On 27 May, Senator Parer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was raised, I think, by a colleague of mine in the Senate. I would like to confirm that the Department of Finance made an arbitrary reduction of $10 million on your funding because of this failure to agree. Is that correct or not?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cochrane, an officer from the Auditor-General's office, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a variety of figures and adjustments in the total $10 million amount. The core amount that affects the financial statement funding, and which is the area that we are most worried about, is about $7 1/2 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I was wrong, I made a mistake&mdash;I was $2 1/2 million out! But the reality is that two months after the Leader of the Government stood up to convince Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens that we did not need an inquiry into the sports rorts affair pork barrel, that the government was going to become accountable all of a sudden, that it was going to look after the Auditor-General and ensure that he was independent and well funded, the government slashed his funding by $7 1/2 million. So much so that Mr Cochrane in the estimates committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequence is that the statutory work is not done&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the statutory requirements for the Auditor-General to audit the government cannot be done under this budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or . . . we do not do a proportion of performance auditing.</PARA>
<PARA>The audit report No. 9 into the sports rorts pork-barrel affair was a performance audit. The government does not want performance audits. It did not want a performance audit into the crooked Dasfleet leases to the Transport Workers Union. It did not want a performance audit into why the Australian Construction Service was given the Maralinga contract. It does not want any performance audits. It does not want accountability and that is why it has slashed the Auditor-General's funds. That is a disgrace. It is a matter that I hope Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Green senators from Western Australia will look at very closely. On 3 March they agreed not to have a Senate select committee inquiry into the sports rorts affair&mdash;something that required investigation by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General basically found a smoking gun with the smell of cordite thick in the air. He found a minister who had destroyed documents. The smoking gun had been thrown into the river. Corruption, the Auditor-General said, could not be proved but it could not be disproved. So the Senate was faced with what was a smoking gun but it decided not to pursue an investigation. I say to the Senate that it made a big mistake on that day and I say to Senator Harradine and the Democrat senators that they should look at the performance of the 3 March government's accountability package because already it has fallen over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that we should look at in the accountability package is the so-called ministerial code of conduct. A little committee was to be set up to write a little code of conduct for ministers. These ministers are so bad they need to have in writing what they should and should not do. We should not need a ministerial code of conduct but with these guys we do. We need a little handbook to hand to people such as Ros Kelly and Senator Faulkner when they take office setting out what they should and should not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If written, the ministerial code of conduct would probably say, `If the Senate passes a motion to table some documents, you will comply with it.' On 5 May, the Senate, by an overwhelming majority, resolved that Senator McMullan should table some documents about another secret deal between two government agencies down in Melbourne, again involving the Australian Construction Service&mdash;another secret deal that this government wants held up. One would think that if there were a ministerial code of conduct, one thing it would say is that when the Senate, the parliament of Australia, passes a motion that a minister must produce documents, he will do so. And one would think further that if that minister failed to produce those documents, as Senator McMullan did&mdash;he was censured on 10 May&mdash;he would try to correct that breach of the Senate's order. But no, Senator McMullan chose on the day he was asked to do so to fly to South America and again remain in breach of the Senate&mdash;which he remains to this day. Of course, the Senate will have to decide what to do to try to have Senator McMullan remedy that breach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of code of conduct that this Labor government would put down: `Forget the parliament&mdash;it is only just a minor hindrance. Forget the Auditor-General&mdash;we have promised that we will upgrade his resources but we will slash him by $7 1/2 million because the Senate will forget about it. We got out of the Senate select committee inquiry into the sports rorts affair because Senator Evans and Mr Beazley were able to sit down with the Democrats and Senator Harradine and convince them that it was okay because we will make ourselves more accountable.' We all have to live with the Senate's decision on that occasion. I respect it. But I have asked the Democrats and Senator Harradine to do what I am doing and to keep a close eye on whether this accountability package gets put in place. And we know already that a couple of legs of it have been knocked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to refer to is another leg of that accountability package, and that is the inquiry into the Centenary House affair. This is something that was originally promised towards the end of 1993. I have an interest in following through these so-called accountability measures. Knowing that the inquiry had not got off the ground, knowing that it was due to report in May but that it had not even met, I asked Senator Cook back on 23 March 1994 what had happened to the inquiry. This inquiry had been foreshadowed back in October and we had still heard nothing of it by March. But he assured us, on 23 March, that it would report on 18 May. Even though I had raised concerns about the powers that the South Australian Auditor-General and Mr Boymal from the finance department had, Senator Cook said, `No, it's all okay. They have got all their powers. The inquiry can go ahead and it will be reporting on 18 May.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that the resources of the Auditor-General are reliant upon the outcome of the Centenary House inquiry. I knew that the Centenary House inquiry was not even under way. But we were assured on 23 March that there would be no problems. We were told, `She'll be right. We will have the inquiry.' Of course, we came back here in May and we were told by way of a surprise announcement&mdash;it was no surprise to me&mdash;that all of a sudden they had to set up a judicial inquiry into Centenary House for reasons that we are yet to be formally advised of. But really, this matter relates to the question I asked Senator Cook back in March, two months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has kept only one promise in regard to the accountability package that he announced virtually to the day three months ago. On 13 May he actually promised to table this response that we are dealing with today. He did keep that promise. We have not seen the audit act but I believe it is coming along very nicely. We will see that when we see it. But Senator Evans misled us on the resourcing of the Auditor-General, he misled us on the Centenary House inquiry and he has misled us on the ministerial code of conduct. So one out of four `ain't bad'. But if he were at school, he would not get a special kookaburra stamp&mdash;he would get red ink all over his essay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to relate is the ongoing effects of the sports rorts affair and the fact that the Senate should still inquire into this matter. It is not gone. The Senate has been bought off temporarily by Senator Evans. I genuinely wish the new minister for sport well in that portfolio because a hell of a lot needs to be done for sports in Australia. Senator Baume, as a previous shadow minister, was very keen to see that happen and it was a great shame that we did not win that last election and allow him the opportunity to become the minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am looking straight at you and I am directing my remarks through you. We have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars spent in the seat of Swan to make sure that Mr Beazley, the so-called Minister for Finance, got re-elected by 200 votes. We saw hundreds of thousands of dollars spent in the seat of Canning to ensure that the so-called Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, got re-elected by 123 votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $600,000 that went into the seat of Swan could have been spent encouraging thousands of young people in that seat to be involved in sport and of those thousands of young people&mdash;and many of them could have been disabled sportspeople or Aboriginal sportspeople&mdash;there could have been budding young athletes. But because we spent the $60 million on the Richardson-Kelly pork barrel sports rorts affair, all of these people will never be found and they may never become Olympians. That is the truth and that is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sad things about the sports rorts affair and the fact that we spent all of that money in facilities through a program that had no evaluation involved in it, is that there is now a massive distortion at the local level. There is a very important Industry Commission inquiry going on which is looking at community and voluntary efforts in sports. One of the matters that have been raised by some of the groups involved at the voluntary and community level is the massive distortion of government funds going into these facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might already be masses of private and voluntary and community sporting facilities which now have to compete against the very facilities that this Labor government's corrupt pork barrel, sports rorts scheme has built. They are now competing in the marketplace for people who want to do swimming, aerobics, gymnastics or netball, and who do them in facilities that have been paid for by the Commonwealth taxpayer. The people who run those facilities do not have to pay capital costs or interest on overdrafts and are, therefore, competing unfairly against the private and voluntary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will have distortions and these distortions will only become obvious over the next couple of years. I have only been the shadow minister for sports for a few days but I have already had representations from a range of people who are upset about the distortions that are being created. The very impact of the sports rorts pork barrel money is that it could actually see private and voluntary effort diminished, and therefore reduce the facilities where the money was, in fact, intended to increase the facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sports rorts affair cannot be allowed to rest in Australian politics. We have had one insignificant, failed, unaccountable minister resign. She will just drift off into the dim, distant, hazy past of politics and if anyone thinks that her scalp is enough to be payment for what went on in the sports rorts affair, then they are kidding themselves. This was a massive mistake in public administration in Australia. There needs to be a proper evaluation of the program. We need to ensure that something like this never happens again. And the insignificant scalp of an insignificant player in the right wing of the Australian Labor Party is not enough to cover the damage that this affair has done to public administration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be a proper inquiry&mdash;there should be a Senate select committee inquiry. I urge the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Greens to consider very carefully whether or not the package that was announced on 3 March and the decision of the Senate not to have that inquiry was, in the light of what has happened since then, the correct decision. I am sure that it was the correct decision for them at the time, but we all need to keep these things under review and I ask them to continue to do so and to support a Senate select committee inquiry into it when the time is right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want firstly to comment on this amendment. I thank Senator Campbell for removing those words. The crux of the issue is the fact that some electorates did indeed get facilities that enabled them to increase participation in sport, recreation and cultural facilities, but other electorates did not. As we have been through this issue time and time again, I will not go into it now. The reasons some electorates did not receive funding were spurious, based on a direct relationship between who the actual members were and which parties they belonged to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to some comments made by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories about the new direction that the Australian Labor Party is taking with regard to funding for sport. I certainly support what the minister is saying about participation, about encouraging young people to be involved, and about putting money into it. That is all fine. It all sounds wonderful. But when one actually looks at what it means on the ground, one begins to wonder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, these groups still need facilities. Yes, fine, there are already some there, but we cannot simply presume that the community is going to pick up where the government left off. I speak particularly of those communities which have been applying year after year&mdash;communities which even have full council approval and totally committed community organisers putting in very detailed applications for sports grants, only to find that they were continually rejected. We see now that they were rejected simply because of the seat to which that particular facility was tied. So I ask the minister to think again about whether we really need some sort of facilities program. The Australian Democrats argue that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is really serious about the participation of young people in sport it will start where it really should begin, and that is in schools. We should have a Commonwealth program to ensure that we have properly qualified and dedicated physical education teachers at primary school level across this country. As well, physical education should be a recognised subject in its own right in all secondary schools. That is simply not happening, partly because of restrictions that now exist with so many things being crowded into the school timetable and partly because physical education needs more resources than many other subjects. It is supposed to have fewer students which again, when schools are under enormous financial stress, means that it is one of the subjects put towards the bottom of the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have schools which are desperately short of recreational facilities that senior secondary students in particular should be using when they move into programs in later high school years. This is not so much for competitive sports such as football and netball but for sports that give students a chance to participate in recreational activities such as squash, golf or tennis when they move on from school. If the minister is really serious about participation for young people he will start where this should be starting, and that is in our primary and secondary schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the Auditor-General's report No. 9 and the government response. The reason why the Australian Democrats are supporting Senator Campbell's motion is that certainly there has been retribution. We were led to believe that the Auditor-General would see an increase in money, staff and resources but, when looking at what has now happened, I see no way for the Democrats other than to support this motion of Senator Campbell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to hearing how the minister's new-found interest in participation will actually be translated on the ground into more young people having access not just to competitive sports, but to a whole range of genuine physical activities that give them an understanding of what it is to be fit, to experience what it is like to be physically fit and to have those levels of fitness maintained throughout their schooling careers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note in the government's response that the Department of Finance sought information from a whole lot of portfolios as to the programs which might be considered to be similar to the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. It came out with a number of categories one of which attracted me. It referred to payments under which grants are paid to individuals, organisations or other governments where the payments are permissive or discretionary. That is a very quaint choice of words in view of the Auditor-General's report on the whole sports rorts affair. It goes on to define them, but I think the words `permissive' and `discretionary' were very apt in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appended a schedule listing those items which were described as permissive or discretionary. I added them up. I found there were 230, plus or minus a few, that were permissive or discretionary&mdash;in other words, 230 programs that would fit the bill of being similar to what happened with the sports grants. I submit that this represents very fertile ground for future investigations by the Auditor-General if this government does not take away his funding&mdash;as has already been referred to by my colleague Senator Chapman and by Senator Lees&mdash;because certainly the Auditor-General has suffered thus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I spoke at an educational seminar in this place which was attended by a lot of people from the Auditor-General's office. They were genuinely concerned about the fact that they were being singled out for treatment by this government because of their actions in doing their job. One person actually asked me what they should do in the future. I said, `Be fearless. Continue to be fearless, because you are the guardians of the taxpayers' money&mdash;of how government spends its money'. That is the role of the Auditor-General and nothing could enhance that perception of it more than what happened with Auditor-General's report No. 9. I have raised the issues of pork-barrelling of taxpayers' money and sports grants, as have Senator Baume, Senator Campbell and others over a couple of years, but it was not until the Auditor-General's report came down that the media grabbed it and took notice of it. I think that reflects the high credibility of the Auditor-General, and he should maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a concern that was expressed in the media and was raised by me and Senator Crane in the estimates hearings and that is the concern that, because the Auditor-General did his job&mdash;in fact, because he carried out his statutory duty&mdash;he has been singled out for adverse attention by this government. Articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> had pointed out that senior public servants and statutory officers were to be given a 20 per cent pay increase if they went on to contracts. The indications in the newspaper were that cabinet had looked at this, decided to penalise the Auditor-General and used a trick to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That trick was to say that if a person was 60 years of age or over that person could not participate in a contract.

Senator Cook said that he would view such a thing seriously too, but he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General is subject to the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>I see that Senator Coates, who was chairman of that committee, is in the chamber, and I recall he made a similar remark. I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But was the decision to make 60 the cut-off a Remuneration Tribunal decision or a cabinet decision?</PARA>
<PARA>The officer in attendance did not know. Then the chairman, Senator Coates, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say I had assumed that the decision, or the proposal, applied to heads of executive departments and that statutory officers who were already appointed for fixed terms were not relevant to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook went on to say that this was something for the Public Service Commissioner rather than for the Department of Finance. I raised the fact that the Auditor-General was responsible to the Minister for Finance and then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I get some answer as to where it sits and who is going to make the final decision?</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to know if the Auditor-General was going to be chopped off. The allegations in various newspapers were that because he had done the job he was being singled out for treatment. Senator Cook responded that this matter was not an appropriate one to raise at this point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not want to set a precedent for doing it in a cacky-handed sort of way just because we happen to be before you.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of language we have to come to expect from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have not heard it much from Senator Cook and I was somewhat surprised by it. It seems to me that an answer should have been given. I do not believe that the chairman was in a position to know one way or another, but he offered an opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was made pretty clear to me that this was all to do with the Public Service Commissioner. By way of comparison, at the estimates committee hearing into industrial relations, Senator Crane questioned Senator Ray about this same matter. Senator Crane asked whether Mr Tony Ayers from the Department of Defence had got caught up in the contract arrangements that were being put in place which would increase salary by trading off tenure. Senator Ray responded by saying that Mr Brereton was writing to the Remuneration Tribunal to put an alternative, and that he understood that it rested with the Remuneration Tribunal. Bear in mind that I had a different answer from Senator Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane went on to talk about other things and the possibility that Mr Ayers had got caught up in this. Senator Crane asked Senator Ray:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does this affect senior officers in any other department?</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the cut-off at 60. Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not affect any departmental secretaries. As I understand&mdash;I will get confirmation in a moment&mdash;the Remuneration Tribunal has to consider cases of statutory officers.</PARA>

<PARA>Obviously, Senator Ray was embarrassed. Here we had a senior departmental official&mdash;one of the most senior in the country&mdash;being penalised as an unintended consequence of what appears to be the government saying to the Auditor-General, `Because you did your statutory job, because you brought out report No. 9, because in the process the whole sports rorts affair was uncovered, we are going to penalise you.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I only wish to speak on one aspect of this particular report, which has been well and truly covered by my colleagues in a very capable manner. As a result of the sports rorts affair and the Auditor-General's findings, we have a situation where the government has done a complete about-face and has run for its life. We have to say, `What happens now?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner came into this chamber and said, `We are now concentrating on the human aspects of sport, on attainment of personal goals by athletes rather than bricks and mortar.' That is fine, but I want to know what is going to happen with some of our athletes in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an ongoing urgent need in our capital city for swimmers from all over the state to have a facility where they can train all year round. Conditions in Tasmania at this time of the year are a little like those in Canberra and it is rather difficult to expect swimmers to be training in open swimming pools around the state. There needs to be an indoor centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very well served by a temporary solution&mdash;a covered pool in the city of Clarence that is well past its use-by date. There have been a lot of discussions and promises of cooperation between local government bodies in southern Tasmania, in the metropolitan area and the state government. If the federal government is fair dinkum about providing support for our athletes up until the Olympic Games, I would have thought that at least it would have given strong consideration to the proposal being mooted by the state government and the Hobart City Council towards building a new aquatic centre in Hobart to serve the whole of Tasmania, and particularly the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hobart City Council has promised $4 million to the project, and the state government has also promised $4 million to the project provided that some funds are made available by the federal government. I doubt very much whether any good would have come of it before the last election campaign because the seat of Denison where Duncan Kerr is the member is a reasonably safe seat. So that seat would not be one into which the government would put money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice Senator Coates is interjecting. I wonder how much lobbying he has done on behalf of his constituents in Tasmania. All the Labor senators have been very quiet. I would suggest that the Labor senators must feel rather embarrassed that the union movement has taken up the cause. The head of the Trades and Labour Council, Jim Bacon, has put together a deal in an attempt to get some money through the white paper program. I congratulate him for that. There was no mention of this by any of the Tasmanian Labor politicians&mdash;particularly the local member, Mr Kerr. As I said, they must be very embarrassed that a lateral thinker like Jim Bacon seems to have gained government support through one of the new Working Nation programs. He may have achieved the success that the Labor members failed to achieve. I wonder how hard they lobbied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that Mr Bacon and the TLC have announced their plans we notice that people from all over the place are jumping on the bandwagon. I noticed that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, have been in Tasmania. According to a press release of 25 May, the local member for Denison has expressed support. Obviously now that someone else has come up with an idea everybody is jumping on the bandwagon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Faulkner was asked about this particular matter he, along with the Prime Minister, said that no funding would be available for this project and the money was going to be spent on helping athletes. I want to know how our athletes in Tasmania are going to be able to train with outdated and outmoded facilities. I hope that the Labor Party members and senators from Tasmania will support this proposal as strongly as they can and gain the needed $2 million from the federal government to allow the aquatic centre to proceed. The centre would not only be great for the athletes, but it would also be a very good recreation facility for all Tasmanians. It will create much needed work in the Hobart metropolitan area. It may even have some effect on the re-election chances of Mr Kerr and his senatorial colleagues. </PARA>

Whilst the government disagrees strongly with this amendment, we will not be dividing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent the amendment is just an attempt to re-run old political campaigns in the hope that perhaps another column inch of publicity might be gained for things which are long since past; things that have passed their political use-by date by a significant period. It certainly reinforces what Senator Collins said by way of interjection at question time: it might be supposed to be a new opposition team, but it is a re-run of the same tired old lines from the old team. If that is to be the case, as it clearly seems to be on this occasion, and as it was at question time, it will be the shortest honeymoon in political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to briefly respond to some of the comments made by Senator Parer. I have high regard for Senator Parer in many ways, but it must be sad to live in the world of conspiracies in which he seems to dwell at the moment. It may be a product of having been in opposition for too long, in which case I have sad news for him. The way the opposition is going, it is going to be there a lot longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the very twisted conspiracy theory that he tried to weave into the circumstances of the application of the principles concerning chief executive salaries in the public sector. To the best of my knowledge the conspiracy he suggests does not exist or have any foundation in fact. He was trying to create a fairly obscure set of interrelationships to fabricate some sense of a profound conspiracy. To my knowledge the problem does not exist and I regret the fact that he sought to weave such a conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we have this bizarre concern by Senator Campbell about the so-called retribution on the audit office with the slashing of funding. That is simply a product of inexperience. People who do not know anything about public sector finance seem to be able to read into figures things that suit the outcome they want. I think this resolution was written before the facts emerged and nobody bothered to change it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am responding to the Auditor-General's report on the landcare and environment action program. The Auditor-General has selected this particular program for study because of DEET's large involvement in the area of providing employment, and this is a new program. One of the reasons why I suspect that the Auditor-General has chosen this program is DEET's poor record over the years in implementing job related programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this case, looking at what the department has done with the LEAP, it seems like the department has got off to a reasonable start. If one was actually scoring the department, one would give it a six out of 10. There are a number of things in the planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting of this program that the Auditor-General has shown some concerns about and indicated a very definite need for DEET to tighten up its performance in this area; but, overall, it is not too bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways it is an important initiative. It is a response to the concerns about youth unemployment which came to a head the year before last when we had the youth summit here in Canberra which I attended. On that day enormous concern across the countryside from all sorts of levels of organisations was expressed from people such as the head of the national chamber of commerce right down to the people who were victims of this government's savage recession in which we were at the depths of at that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come up with a number of initiatives to help solve the problem of youth unemployment and this is one of the more imaginative ones. Not only is it targeting an area of high unemployment, that is youth unemployment, but by its very nature it is also providing a very necessary service to the country in that a lot of the work is focused on the restoration of the land, not only in rural areas but also in urban areas. It helps to restore the environment and the heritage of this country and, therefore, the direction in which this government is heading with this project is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a number of concerns, particularly in relation to the achievements that come out of this initiative not only in the overall level of placement for people who need work experience but also the types of groups that are receiving that experience and the regions that are gaining the places. In that light, in a minute, I will draw to the attention of the Senate one case study where I believe that the implementation of the LEAP has left a lot to be desired. I know my colleague Senator Brownhill in his area has also come across problems with the implementation of this scheme, and he will be talking about another case study. But let us look first of all at the achievements of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the LEAP there have been 5,500 commencements out of 9,000 contracted places and $55 million has been spent on this project&mdash;curiously, as the Auditor-General reports, 99 per cent of the funding. If, originally, 9,000 places were to be provided and only 5,500 have been provided which, according to the figures, takes up 99 per cent of the funding, one wonders what would have happened if the department had actually contracted out the full 9,000 places. Where would the money have come from for that? It seems that the department was a fair way under target because, obviously, the money was not there to place more. There was a real opportunity to place more people because some of the figures I will read out a little later indicate that the people who set up brokerages to operate this program were certainly around and that great numbers of them were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the positive things about the small number of placements that were made related to the composition of the people who were employed. Six per cent of places went to the disabled and eight per cent went to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Even though 27 per cent went to the long-term unemployed, I would suggest to the Senate that that figure is far too low given that the chances of the long-term unemployed getting any new jobs that come up is about 10 in 100&mdash;they only have a 10 per cent chance of picking up new employment. One would have thought that an initiative like this perhaps would have balanced out a little better and given them a higher ranking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific case study which shows the inadequacies of the way in which this program has been administered relates to my own area of Newcastle where the Newcastle Earth Team was a successful broker last year and did place people in positions. The NET set up its infrastructure and was running very well but then the government pulled the rug out from under it. The NET had to recompete with a whole group of new applicants. When the dust settled in that process, the Newcastle Earth Team missed out. What a pity that was because, looking at what it achieved in that year, the government has just wasted an excellent program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The LEAP, as applied by the Newcastle Earth Team, was designed to assist the 15- to 20-year-olds. Landcare was the vehicle used to provide the experience for working practices, group skills, reliability and punctuality. The program had a duration of 26 weeks. It was comprised of three days per week of hands-on experience and one day per week of classroom activities. The 15- to 17-year-olds were given an allowance of $125 per week, and the ones over 18, $150 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Newcastle Earth Team had been formed by four non-profit sponsor organisations in Newcastle: Throsby Land Care which has done great work in restoring the mouth of the Throsby basin as it enters Newcastle harbour; Trees in Newcastle which has done quite a lot for the greening of the city; the Carrington Parks Project which is in one of the poorest and more run-down areas of the city and which has done great work in bringing those areas back to life; and Integral Urban Housing. These were all facilitated by the LEAP which the government has now terminated, and places have been taken from an area of great need in the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was this program creating great work experience for these people but it was fulfilling a real need in the regeneration of Newcastle's urban environment. Some of the sponsors behind this were some of the top organisations in the city, including the Newcastle City Council. So it was very hard to understand the reasoning behind the government's exclusion of the NET group to run the LEAP. It was a waste of valuable resources in the personnel that set it up and it has deprived people of the opportunity to continue developing their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the terrible things about the way this program has been terminated is the fact that people are mid-course. The government has said, `Well, it can be contracted out to other people.' But, if it was a successful program, why not let it continue? It basically comes down to the fact that the government has set up a scheme that operates on short-term budgetary targets. Every year the government reconsiders everything instead of giving people the stability to continue and complete projects over a period. I find it amazing that the government has not done its planning on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems, quite by accident or by stealth, to have got into a pattern with its budgets of four-year budgeting. Honourable senators will have noticed some of the rather strange outcomes of this. The government will put up a wine tax or a petrol tax. The government will announce it one year, it will go up that year and then it will go up the next year. But the government does not tell us about it the next year; it only tells us about it in the first year, and so all these things sneak up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government was into this long-term budgeting, why should it not do it for this sort of program where it makes a lot of sense? The government should set up a thing and say, `We believe that will work. We will fund it and it will be monitored', and let it go ahead. That would give people security in setting the program. It would allow the program to bed down, the personnel to gain the skill and the students involved in the program to finish off the work; but, no, it gets terminated midstream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come across this sort of thing before. In the area of adult and community education we have had major hearings around Australia and we have found out all about these great programs that were going on but were terminated after one year. I plead with the government to reconsider this procedure and to move into longer term planning than it is doing, and to allow successful programs to bloom instead of chopping them off at the roots as is happening at the moment. These programs are so much needed in our area. In my area there is 49 per cent youth unemployment in the centre of Newcastle and on the north coast nearby unemployment is about 20 per cent, but the government will not fund initiatives that have the potential of the project developed by NET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I wrote to the minister about this and asked, `Why are you not continuing to fund this successful program?', all I got back from his parliamentary secretary was a great list of all the ways in which the money is divided up, with so much to each state, so much to each group, and so much to all the regions in the group. But the net effect is that with very successful programs such as LEAP the government has not put in enough resources. It is to the government's unending shame that it has not funded this effort. Not only is there a need for the work to be done in terms of the renewal of the environment, but there is the huge need for the youth of this country to have the opportunity of more jobs, particularly in areas of high unemployment. DEET really needs to sharpen its act in terms of not only redirecting resources to this particular area but also in the way in which it implements the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report found a number of shortcomings with these programs, and I have pointed out some of them, including the example of NET in Newcastle. But the Auditor-General also found serious shortcomings in planning right across Australia. The report found that in planning there was too much focus on short-term activities, and that is the basic point I have been making in the last few minutes. Shortcomings were found in management, particularly in design, where at federal level those concerned were not really aware of the initiatives of the states in youth and conservation programs. It found that consultation with the states should have started earlier and that targets tended to be a little overambitious. Reporting was not sufficiently detailed and there was evidence that in many cases reports had not even been read&mdash;which I find amazing at this stage of the audit cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With monitoring, the Auditor-General's report found insufficient attention was given to the need for monitoring by the CES of LEAP programs. We have seen major changes in the CES because of its inadequacies in major areas. Again, there seem to have been inadequacies in terms of the LEAP program. Overall, the report is saying that what is being done in LEAP is a good start, but that insufficient resources are being applied to it. Some of the processes certainly need sharpening up. Probably the process that needs sharpening up most of all is the fact that these are programs of a one-year cycle. If we get them onto a longer term cycle, we will find that we will get much more efficient outcomes. Things that are established and work will continue, and the youth of Australia will have the opportunity to get the experience they need for work. Finally, in a program like LEAP, the environment vote in the country and the urban areas will be much improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to speak on the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 34. The first part of the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The good management of the implementation of new programs is essential to give effect to Government policy intentions, to ensure funds are well used and to achieve the desired program outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Although there are good intentions with this program, it is not working as well as it should. In fact, there is ample indication that</PARA>
<PARA>the people who are allocating the funds to LEAP programs have no knowledge of land care and no understanding of what is involved in implementing any environmental programs. In the words of one LEAP coordinator, `It is just so obvious that the people who are deciding on who gets the continued funding have absolutely nil knowledge of what is involved.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a great shame because the Auditor-General also said that there are a number of aspects of LEAP implementations which could have been improved notwithstanding the program's achievements. Senator Tierney has made the point that it is good for employment in that it is getting people into employment, and nobody is against that whatsoever. But this program is about land care and environmental action. That is a part of the program that is not working as well as it should. Its main aim is to get employment and not to teach the young people irrelevant skills. I think that is a rather sad thing in this area where land care is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few weeks we have seen what has happened with 20-odd million tonnes of dust flying over our country. Something has to be done about the environment. Landcare is doing a great job as far as that is concerned, but it has some warts on it. I want to quote to the Senate from some evidence that the committee took in Queensland from a Ms O'Donnell. She is a LEAP coordinator and part-time teacher at the Cooloola and Sunshine Institute of TAFE at Gympie. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they are properly organised. One of the things that are not happening is continued funding.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is my big complaint about this program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide funding for students to plant trees and then not to provide funding for them to maintain them is a complete waste of time&mdash;that is what we had. We set up a program last year with verbal guarantee of three years funding. That did not come through so those trees that were planted are now six feet under weeds, literally, because we have had a five-month wait for the next course to start. We have now got another course which started two weeks ago. It is running and we will eventually have those students out clearing those sites. We expect that at least half those trees have died, if not all. They should be now two metres high and they are probably about 50 centimetres high, because they had only been in the ground a month or two before they were abandoned. If that is how LEAP is being funded across the state, then most of the funding is achieving nothing environmentally. It should be achieving something for the clients, the students, but it is not achieving anything for the environment, from our point of view.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is rather sad for those 50 centimetre high trees. Some $55 million is going into this program but only $102 million goes into the total landcare program. So it is a big slice of a budget that is meant to be doing something for the environment as well as getting people jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to get people working and to get them jobs. The Auditor-General goes on in his report to tell us the number of people who are employed on this scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the commencement of 5500 participants out of some 9000 contracted places (3000 places did not become available until June 1993, when additional program funding was approved)</PARA>
<PARA>But the funding of $55 million needs to be reconsidered. If LEAP is going to be funded and is to achieve the right thing for young unemployed people so that they will take an interest in the environment and will get them going, then I think that is great. But it is no good starting programs if they cannot be kept funded after the start-up period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak just briefly on the Auditor-General's report No. 34 on the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the landcare and environment action program, LEAP. The report picks up on several points which lie behind what both Senator Brownhill and Senator Tierney were saying earlier; that is, there is no doubt at all that we need to spend a great deal more on protecting and enhancing the environment. We have in many respects a very degraded environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill pointed to the fact that in my own state of South Australia just last Tuesday we lost some 20 million to 30 million tonnes of topsoil, which blew from South Australia across Victoria and New South Wales and finished up out in the Tasman Sea. The estimates of what that has cost the country run into many tens of millions of dollars but, of course, the cost is ongoing because that topsoil simply cannot be replaced. In terms of landcare, there is an enormous job still to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of reclamation of waterways, there is also an enormous job to be done. We have all seen the very heavy pollution of the Murray-Darling system. About 18 months ago a thousand kilometres of the Darling River was infected with blue-green algae, making it quite impossible to use for human consumption or even cattle. The same thing has happened lower down in the Lake Alexandrina and lower Murray region, where again an area that was normally used extensively for irrigation was quite incapable of supporting that form of use over a very extended period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point that Adelaide, my home city, is quite seriously in danger of totally losing its water supply. All we need in South Australia is the combination of an extremely dry winter where there is very little catchment in the Adelaide hills region behind Adelaide, combined with the onset of an early summer and the high nutrient loads in the Murray-Darling system, which would preclude the pumping of water from the Murray, and Adelaide would quite literally be without water. That is a real possibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very expensive solution. What I am saying is there is clearly a need to spend a great deal more on the environment. While in the main the Auditor-General praises the LEAP scheme, I would like to pick up on the points that lie behind what Senator Tierney and Senator Brownhill were saying. It is paradoxical that we achieve a great deal more employment&mdash;that was the intention of the LEAP scheme&mdash;if we aim to do something solid and lasting for the environment and, coincidentally, employ people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a criticism that needs to be made of this LEAP scheme, it is, primarily, to employ people and, secondarily, to do something for the environment along the way. I believe it was that mixed motivation which caused the sorts of problems that Senator Tierney and Senator Brownhill have pointed to. I refer to the starting of programs which have then been stopped before they have achieved their objectives; and associated with that, the fact that the people who were employed in these LEAP schemes for short periods&mdash;26 weeks in many cases&mdash;were not then able to go on with longer term employment. If the orientation had been toward long-term solid protection of the environment, building something of lasting value in environmental protection, coincidentally then providing employment, that employment would also have been of longer lasting and greater benefit to the people who were involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should spend a great deal more on environmental protection and in that way can employ many more people, particularly long-term unemployed, it can involve them in training and so on, but its orientation must be the overall social benefit. It must be the protection and enhancement of the environment. Through that I believe the government will achieve a better and longer term solution to the problem of unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I too would like to make some comments on Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 34. I want to pick up on the comments of my colleagues and also Senator Coulter. I particularly draw attention to page xiii, where one sees the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there should be an understanding by decision-makers of the dangers of not taking into account the essentiality of the factors which are critical to the good management of program implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Coulter's comments. One of the problems with the LEAP program was that in the initial stages not enough attention was paid to the programs and the benches that were to be addressed. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that, because they were such short-term operations, the chosen program was not selected carefully enough and that there has not been the required follow through, after that employment and training opportunity has been given, for the program to continue on and to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill and Senator Tierney both outlined a couple of similar programs. I have watched tree planting programs where trees were, in my view, and from the information that I collected from the experts, initially placed in the wrong place. After that program had finished, it was only a matter of time before the trees were overgrown by weeds and other things or where the trees died because the species that were planted on that soil type were not suitable for what was required. At the end of the day it is also important that the considerations of the effect and the long-term benefit of the LEAP program look beyond the training and the employment that was provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of points need to be highlighted. Certainly more care must be taken in the selection of sites. The second point to be highlighted is that 12 or 15 months down the track when a project fails it will not produce the type of ethic or the feeling of success amongst people that they have contributed to something really worthwhile. It will not result in something that they can look back on if trees have died through lack of care in selecting the site and tree type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that all the recommendations but one have written underneath them `Agreed in principle; already applies to LEAP'. I would challenge those comments by DEET. I do not believe it has implemented the recommendations properly or thoroughly. I agree with the vast majority of the recommendations. I think they are a practical way forward, and I would question the ease with which DEET responds to these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up my comments, it is necessary that more care be taken in the projects. In many instances it is necessary that the group of people who get involved follow up projects. This could be carried out by other unemployed people, or proper care and maintenance could be achieved under some other scheme Finally, I believe DEET&mdash;and of course the government because, after all, DEET is an arm of government&mdash;needs to pay a lot more attention to the recommendations contained in this report. It needs to implement them not just in principle but also in detail and application. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 35 1993-94</EMPHASIS> deals with an efficiency audit into the compliance function of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and is very interesting. The compliance function is an essential part of the maintenance of the integrity of Australia's immigration system. We are very fortunate in Australia to have a country which is surrounded by water. We have no adjoining land borders with other countries. That makes the surveillance and monitoring of our immigration program, or the intake of migrants into Australia, that much easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, as we have seen from long experience, our very long coastline makes the detection of unauthorised border arrivals more difficult than it would otherwise be. But the compliance function relates essentially to requiring people who arrive in Australia legally and then become illegal to comply with the law and therefore leave when they are detected. The overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants in Australia have come in legally and overstayed. Essentially, that is the case with people who come in on a tourist or visitor visa, a short-term visa, and overstay their entry, therefore becoming illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there are about 80,000 illegal immigrants in Australia. That is a very large figure although it has to be kept in perspective when we consider that, nowadays, there are 5.2 million arrivals in Australia each year of people who come in as visitors, permanent immigrants or for other reasons, and of those 5.2 million arrivals, approximately 20,000 overstay each year. That is a large number, but it is less than half of one per cent of the total annual arrivals, and needs to be kept in context in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, each year we are getting 20,000 illegal entrants in the form of overstayers and the compliance function, which essentially is to detect those illegal entrants and to ensure that they leave Australia, is very important because if it is not carried out the integrity of the whole of our migration program is undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of compliance in Australia is estimated by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs today to be of the order of $30 million. That is a not insignificant drain on taxpayers' funds. It is encouraging to see that the number of illegal entrants is declining marginally year by year. In the last year or so the total has fallen by about 2,000. In 1992-93, 15,000 illegal overstayers were located and most of those, of course, were required to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there were 20,000 new illegal entrants. The reason the total number is falling is that some of those who do overstay subsequently leave of their own volition, without having to be required by the department to comply. The efficiency audit by the audit office does, I am pleased to say, reach the conclusion that the department is addressing the challenges associated with the proper management of this compliance function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office adds that improvements can come with better coordination of activities and greater attention to ensuring that data used to support operations is timely and accurate. There are some useful recommendations by the audit office, most of which the department appears to agree with. I hope that as a result of the efficiency audit and the department's consideration of it, we will see further improvements in the compliance function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one point in particular that I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate; that is, the question of illegal entrants working whilst in Australia. The rule is that people who are illegally in Australia are not permitted to work. One of the interesting and significant findings, and a finding of concern by the audit office, was that the procedures followed by the Commonwealth Employment Service do not require its staff to screen applicants to establish that they have the right to work in Australia. On page 41 the audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the checks are not performed and an individual who is not entitled to work is referred by CES to an employer, employers could be placed in the position where they employ, train and become reliant upon staff provided by the CES and then see the staff taken into custody by DIEA, another arm of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>The audit report makes the following very proper point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination of an individual's right to work is not only a task for the employers. At an individual office level, staff of the CES are also encouraged by some DIEA offices to examine the right to work of individuals prior to referring them to potential employers. CES procedures do not involve such checks unless staff have reason to suspect that jobseekers may be overseas visitors, in which case staff can ask to see a valid passport or a valid visa before referring them to vacancies. Therefore, in some cases, it was referring to employers jobseekers who could not legally work.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of concern. It is ridiculous to have a situation where one Commonwealth agency, in this case the CES, is referring potential employees to employers, despite the fact that those employees are not legally entitled to work in Australia. I strongly believe, as does the audit report and indeed the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, that the CES should have greater responsibility in establishing that its clients have authority to work in Australia. Here we are spending $30 million on the compliance function through the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, yet in contravention of that compliance function illegal entrants are being referred for work by the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO's recommendation 14 is that the CES and DIEA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should strengthen their stance on entitlement to work, with complementary action by the CES to ensure that its services are provided only to those entitled to them.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs agrees with the thrust of that recommendation and says in its response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is currently no national arrangement between the DIEA and the CES in this regard, most DIEA compliance offices have an arrangement at local level whereby CES officers may contact DIEA for guidance on how to establish a person's immigration status with respect to work.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand the response of the Department of Employment, Education and Training is less than enthusiastic and is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted. In DEET's view that the use of CES job brokerage services by illegal entrants is minor and the problem may be overstated by the DIEA. In particular, the vast majority of CES registrants are Department of Social Security beneficiaries and are subject to a rigorous identity and residency check by that Department.</PARA>
<PARA>The DEET response adds, I am pleased to note, that it is: . . . currently giving priority to the development of procedures for verifying applicants' identity and residency status as a prerequisite for access to labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that should be a priority on the part of the CES. Obviously there are cost factors involved for the CES in undertaking a more rigorous checking of the eligibility for employment by its clients. Nevertheless, if we are really serious about having an immigration program which respects the integrity that we all want that program to have, the cost obviously will not be excessive in ensuring that all agencies of government work with that common aim in mind&mdash;namely, the integrity of the program. That is an important point of principle as well as of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other recommendations in the report that I will not go into now. I commend the Australian National Audit Office on the report which is very helpful. I am pleased that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs gets a pretty clean bill of health in terms of compliance functions. I hope that it will get an even cleaner bill of health as a result of its positive response to the Auditor-General's recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to delay the Senate for very long, but I would like to speak to this report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Project Audit&mdash;Australian National Maritime Museum Commercial Operations</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for a variety of reasons. One reason is that I am a strong supporter of the National Maritime Museum. I am proud to be member No. 44 and indeed I joined on the day it opened when I was shadow minister for the arts. I have a strong feeling of pleasure in the achievements of the museum but also a feeling of regret that the saga of basic problems surrounding the concept still continue, as is revealed in the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will remember that the project was born as a result of a most extraordinary arrangement done by Mr Brereton when he was a minister in the New South Wales state Labor government. The project involved that government in a building commitment that resulted, as I recall, in the building costing twice as much as the state government had been advised it would cost. The state government was required to pick up the rest of the tab. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened since then has been another series of grievous miscalculations. As the Auditor-General notes, the expectations of revenue by this museum&mdash;which is a high quality museum that is well worth visiting, and I encourage any senators who have not yet visited it yet to do so and indeed to become members&mdash;at the time it was opened were massively higher than could possibly be achieved. As the Auditor-General points out, in 1992-93 revenue from the museum was estimated at $4 million; it was 28 per cent of the expenditure budget of $14.8 million. But in fact revenue achieved in that year was only $1.64 million&mdash;in other words, only 10.7 per cent of final expenditure. In the current financial year revenue estimates were reduced to about $2 million, which is 13 per cent of the expected expenditure budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who one can blame for the non-achievement of those targets. The Auditor-General clearly says that there are ways of improving the financial situation. In the current financial year the government is having to supplement the income of the Maritime Museum by $13.5 million, which is up about $800,000. But the fact is that this is some $4.6 million higher than the pre-opening forecast of the government. This clearly means that this museum is a financial disaster. That is a great shame. I do not know whether one should say that the original calculations were ludicrous and therefore it is not fair to criticise the museum, or that the museum should be doing better. However, the Auditor-General clearly outlines some improvements that he believes are capable of being introduced to the museum's procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it should be noted that the museum itself in its response to the Auditor-General contends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the audit has, in a number of instances, identified the need to progress areas of commercial management that the Museum was evolving towards through its own experience and identified needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the Museum accepts that it can improve on its commercial performance to date. However, from any comparative analysis of its competitors, and given the modest nature of its own budgets, the Museum believes it is unlikely such improvements will result in more than marginal increases in net revenue or returns.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the key question in these kinds of government enterprises. The question is whether an alert, lively promotional campaign, had the funds been available for it, would have sufficiently increased revenues; whether the changes in the procedures recommended by the Auditor-General would sufficiently improve revenues to make it worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that what the Auditor-General is recommending is absolutely and totally right&mdash;as we are accustomed to, as this government is so accustomed to that it is now setting out to cut the Auditor-General's revenue, because it does not want the Auditor-General pointing out so accurately the failures of the government. However, in this case, I think it may be true that the benefits to be obtained at the moment may well not merit an enormous expenditure on improved structures, but there is clearly a case, which I think the museum has totally accepted, that there can be improvements made. There must be improvements made because this kind of subsidy simply cannot continue, this proportionate failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the new casino project, which will be its neighbour at Pyrmont, will attract more customers, because at this stage the museum is at the end of the walkways, at the end of all of this redevelopment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report causes me a great deal of concern, and I have only three minutes in which to express that concern. I just looked at this report and the statement by Councillor Samaras denies allegations that I did not make about him. This is an absolute nonsense. The fact is that in a notice of motion I had talked about the involvement in a fraud. In other words, there was a fraud case in which Mr Gino Mandarino, President of the Illawarra Branch of Young Labor, was fined $800 for his involvement in forging an electoral form. I said that there was no doubt that Councillor Michael Samaras was involved in this whole procedure. We can see that from the Australian Federal Police evidence. Councillor Samaras, a prospective left wing Labor candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Council, at the time was also a staffer of a former left wing member for Cunningham, Mr Stewart West&mdash;we should note that&mdash;whose office was advised of the completion of this fraudulent form, a copy of which was sent by facsimile.</PARA></TALK.START>

Councillor Samaras was advised that no form had been received, the Federal Police said. Later that morning the form was found in the mail. In the meantime, a false forged return was put in. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will make some initial comments and perhaps reserve some more detailed comments for a later time. I and others in the Senate estimates committees process that has just taken place felt rather annoyed, frustrated and at times distressed at the lack of information that was presented and with the new budget format in the portfolio budget measures statements. I did try to take the opportunity of finding out about the new format that these particular reports would take before the process began so that I and my staff would know as much as possible about the implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got hold of the video that was taken during the Senate briefing with regard to these reports. I think if it were a commercial operation one might have trouble under the Trade Practices Act because during that particular briefing it was mentioned that, apart from the fact that we were dealing with nine months of actuals and three months of estimates, the idea of the new format was to make the information more accessible and provide more information upon which decisions and judgments could be made. In my and my staff's estimation it was neither. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half way down the first page of this particular report, under the heading `Requirements for Departmental Annual Reports', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between them, these documents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the portfolio budget measures statements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide the government and the parliament with detailed information about the operation and performance of government programs, assessments of results and forecasts of future needs and expectations.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned before, they were hardly particularly detailed and often they were presented in such a way that it was extremely difficult to gain any real indication of this year's spending, last year's spending, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little further down on this first page of the introduction, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These annual reporting requirements have been designed in particular to emphasise program performance and in the achievements of program objectives, i.e. a focus on results. They are intended to provide sufficient information for the parliament to make a fully informed judgment on departmental performance, while avoiding excessive and extraneous detail.</PARA>
<PARA>Such things as an $11 million subsidy to Transfield Shipping to promote the development of military related industry in Malaysia was considered to be information excessive to the parliament's requirements. My first question is: in whose opinion? In at least one of those estimates committees I asked this question, `Who made the judgment as to what was to be cut out of this year's particular programs?' The response was, `Well, it was a decision of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and it was also a decision from the Department of Finance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted some level of concern and distress on the faces of people whose job it was in those estimates committees to try to explain those things that we had a lot of difficulty gaining from those reports. There were a lot of requirements to supply a lot more detail than was available through those reports. I think it backfires on any government when it sometimes looks as if it is trying to hide something. Reports should not be presented in such a way that one year cannot easily be compared with the last; I understand the difference in the year structure but I do have a problem with the changing of the format of the documents at the same time that all this took place. So it was extremely difficult to gain that information. In many cases we often knew to ask about what it was we could not know from the report when we stumbled across it by accident, almost&mdash;through the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we know what it is we ought to be asking about if we are told by ministers or some members of departments that the information is available in some other form somewhere. We might be directed towards it, but we have to stumble across that problem in order to be able to ask the questions. So I think it was thoroughly dissatisfying. I believe it has reflected badly on the government, because it looks like it is trying to hide something, rather than trying to be transparent in its presentation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The document which is entitled `Access to Justice Advisory Committee', otherwise known as the Sackville report, is a very welcome contribution to the ongoing cost of justice debate. That is not to say that I agree with everything in it, or think that it has everything in it that it ought to have. Nonetheless, it is one more report and part of what I want to say today is that I hope it does not stay as just one more report, that we actually start to see some action with respect to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for people in a front bar to look up on  Skychannel and see pictures of Bosnia and a whole range of other places where people do not have the same rights that we have here and to feel somehow smugly confident about that. Of course they should, because we do have rights that a lot of people in other countries do not have. But it comes to not much if people cannot afford to access them, and that is the situation at the moment. People simply cannot afford to access their rights, and, worse still, a lot of people do not know what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sackville report, raising yet again the cost of justice issues, was probably the straw that broke the camel's back and led to at least one, that I know of, achievement in respect of this area. Other straws that went towards breaking the camel's back started in estimates committees several years ago, where senators&mdash;primarily myself but others joining in&mdash;wanted to break the secrecy surrounding the distribution of an enormous amount of money, about $11 million worth of fees, paid to private counsel by the Attorney-General's Department. When it could not handle the workload or it wanted a specialist it briefed that work out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone has a consultant, or a carpenter, to do a job that is paid for by taxpayers money, estimates committees are entitled to get to the bottom of what that was about, to make sure the carpenter or the consultant was not improperly paid, to ascertain what work they were paid to do and whether the rates were fair; all of those sorts of things that go to the administration of any particular portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow, in the Attorney-General's department, there was a view that the legal profession was different, that it was somehow immune from parliamentary scrutiny, and that the legal profession and the Attorney-General's Department could privately decide how much information they would give to parliament. It is ridiculous to accept such a notion. But nonetheless the Attorney-General's Department accepted it, year in and year out, for years. The reply we were given was that it was commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We realise that the mere mouthing of those words, were we to allow them to be effective, would allow no proper scrutiny of how the government spends taxpayers' money. Contracts for pencils could have a confidentiality clause. We had a run-in some time ago with the ABC when it put confidentiality clauses in contracts for staff that it employed. It just is not on. If it is taxpayers' money, parliament is entitled to know what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked about the Sackville report being the straw that broke the camel's back, and I indicated that there were other straws raised at the Senate estimates committee. I also give credit to the legal profession in this respect. I wrote to the bar associations recently and said, `Look, the view is being put to parliament that one of the reasons we do not have access to what barristers are paid by the Commonwealth in this $11 million is that they are entitled to some sort of special privilege. We are told that it is a market confidentiality agreement. Therefore, will you please advise me if your association has a view as to whether that ought to be allowed?' Thus far all the replies I have had from the bar associations have said, `Of course not; we have no view that we ought to be able to keep that matter from parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney, having discovered through reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that I had those letters and that that was the view of the bar associations, may have tried to tough it out. The release of the Sackville report said that there has to be more openness in fees for better competition, enabling better competition for the taxpayers' dollar and the taxpayer to get better value in legal services. Now that the Attorney has seen the barrel looking at him and has given in, he has finally said, `Yes, we will release the amounts that we pay to barristers. We will reveal the hourly and daily rates.' Now we will see some real competition for that $11 million and probably see some of the work shift out of Sydney to other states, which of course will be welcomed.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on the Sackville report which the Senate is addressing today. The Sackville report pulls together a whole range of recommendations, many of which have been previously contained in other reports&mdash;for instance, in the report on the cost of justice inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; in the report by the inquiry on the operation of the Family Law Act; in the report by the TPC on its recent investigation of the legal profession, as well as in the Hilmer report on competition policy. But I believe the Sackville report is a very timely, comprehensive assessment of a very large range of measures that needs to be taken to reduce the cost of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the Australian Democrats welcome the proposals contained in the report. In particular, we welcome the recommendations for increased funds for legal aid and community legal centres, more mediation and arbitration programs, more deliberate case management by judges, more mediation in specific areas such as the family law jurisdiction, a review of court fees and procedures, removal of the remaining restrictions on advertising and the establishment of an independent complaints mechanism for the legal profession which is long overdue. As I said, these have been part of numerous recommendations on the reform of the legal system which have been made before. It is, however, a measure of the magnitude and complexity of the task that some concerns remain, despite this very comprehensive range of measures suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get onto our concerns, I would like to say that it is to be hoped that the Commonwealth government will now find, at long last, the political will to overcome the institutional inertia of the legal system as well as the clout of those in the profession who seek to maintain their privileged and lucrative position and indeed implement the majority of the reforms suggested. The concerns that we have about the proposals concern mainly the level of lawyers' fees. It is proposed to allow market forces to operate by abolishing fee scales and allow solicitors and barristers to advertise their services and their fees. As well it is proposed to provide market knowledge for prospective clients by publishing regular statistical surveys of fees charged by the profession to enable those seeking advice to judge whether they should agree to the fees offered by the solicitor or barrister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recommendations assume that clients and lawyers are negotiating from a position of equality. In fact, lawyers have succeeded in maintaining an aura of mystique and authority and in most cases will be dealing with people from lower socio-economic strata with lower levels of education than those in the profession. Together with a better information base lawyers will therefore usually be in a position of superior market strength which must be balanced if lower costs are to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Sackville points to the independent complaints authority&mdash;and, as I have said, that will certainly be most welcome&mdash;and the fast track review mechanism for disputes less than $20,000. However, all this occurs after the event, and making a complaint and obtaining statistical information requires an act of will and resources of some time and money, even though efforts have been made to reduce that, and many clients could not muster those resources and should not be asked to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if lawyers were obliged to provide prospective clients with the latest relevant statistics when they make the first inquiry, the average or median costs will still be derived from the aggregate fees charged which are determined by practising members of the profession. If we are serious about creating a contract between equals then we should empower the Prices Surveillance Authority to supervise the profession and to provide guidelines on maximum acceptable charges. Since we are looking for market solutions we should generate some real competition and provide a funding boost for community legal centres.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As we are talking on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report, and as a practising legal practitioner, I know only too well the unfortunate cost and delay associated with the provision of justice in our country. Legal aid clearly as an institution or as a public service body I believe is embarking on an empire-building exercise in continually restricting private practitioners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very well aware of the role that big bureaucracy and big government can play in seeking to deny justice to ordinary Australians.

What had occurred was that the department had accidentally undercharged for the lease and was seeking to retrospectively reclaim the money by docking wages. </PARA>

The account was for $1,200 and that was received about halfway through the protracted negotiations which ended up by my client not being required to pay a single cent. I remind the Senate that the matter involved a $1,500 account and that, at about halfway through, the Attorney-General's Department had already run up a bill of $1,200. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the Department of Defence is one of the largest users of legal services in the Commonwealth.

<PARA>This is the final report of the Australian Wool Corporation, which recently oversaw a volatile chapter in the history of the Australian wool industry. The recent wool crisis offered the Australia Wool Corporation the opportunity to take a more competitive and aggressive role in the development of the Australian wool industry&mdash;an opportunity that it attempted to take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Corporation's main priority in its final period was to increase domestic and international demand for Australian wool. The government, manufacturers, woolgrowers and representatives of industry bodies also realised that they were all responsible for a clear reduction in the wool bale stockpile. Each segment had a role to play in the initiatives and affairs of marketing, research and industry stability. Hence the corporation, in cooperation with these groups, began to reconstruct the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where there was much work and initiative was in the development of trade with what is now our major wool importer&mdash;China. The corporation worked alongside such organisations as its subsidiary the International Wool Secretariat, AIDAB and Austrade to develop international demand for Australian wool. This included joint ventures with Chinese companies, technical assistance and guidance for rural wool processing, and specific training courses in the Australian wool market for groups of wool technicians. All of these initiatives were designed to improve demand for Australian wool in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives of the corporation have provided the opportunity for its replacement bodies&mdash;the Wool Realisation and Promotion organisation and Wool International&mdash;to ensure the long-term growth of a competitive Australian Wool Industry. Of major significance will be ATIP. It is hoped that these will develop beyond the mere identification of primary targets to comprehensive packages to improve international demand for Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the reconstruction of the Australian wool industry has been dominated by the need to increase demand for Australian wool, the corporation always recognised the importance of improving the quality of supply. Quality control of the Australian clip remains essential, and I commend the move by the major wool broking houses to maintain a high standard of clip preparation by encouraging wool growers to do it themselves through the obvious incentive of increased returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large chapter of the wool history has closed with this final report. The wool industry is up and running with new industry structures. I wish the industry well and thank the Australian Wool Corporation for the constructive role that it has played over the last 20 years, particularly in difficult times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise tonight following an answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, to a question today on CSIRO research funding. Clearly, severe funding cuts to primary industry research within the CSIRO are threatening the future competitiveness of our agricultural export sector. This sector provides a quarter of our export dollars. It is a clear indication of the government's rhetoric about increasing our export markets and subsequently reducing our current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appears to believe that agriculture is an industry on the way out. This view is certainly reflected in the reckless cost-cutting exercise that has taken place with CSIRO funding. Overall the CSIRO funding cuts of $20 million per year announced in the Working Nation white paper have been biased away from primary industry. This has been compounded by reduced external industry funding resulting from the rural recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An internal memo to staff of the CSIRO Institute of Animal Production and Processing is very telling indeed. With 138 jobs to be shed, it shows the extent to which primary industry will suffer. This occurs even after significant asset sales. While there may be some merit in the rationalisation of research sites, it is not appropriate to countenance  wholesale cuts to research staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, a drop in the quality of the research conducted by those who remain is obvious. The internal memo also indicated that the organisation is attempting to save Labor's hide by blaming the cuts on a drop in agricultural funding from external sources. Not one mention is made of the reduction in government funding for the CSIRO. I apprehensively await an announcement on how the inevitable budget cuts for the Institute of Plant Production and Processing will be implemented. Similarly, I worry about what will happen to the Wool Technology Division. Unlike mining, telecommunications and information technology, agriculture is not a priority funding area for the CSIRO. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht is part of the government, and the government has its hands on the levers and makes the decisions about funding. Therefore, the government is responsible. If funding matched the industry's export status, the eight primary industry research divisions would have had their budgets increased. This extra cash would have come from the special pool of funds maintained by the CSIRO for priority projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO's approach to primary industry research is, I believe, short-sighted. Ultimately it will undermine the future competitiveness of our farmers. It should be noted that we are amongst the most efficient and hard-working agricultural producers in the world. If field stations are closed and their production orientated research abandoned, it will have very disastrous consequences for the total economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO is sending out the wrong message to the various research and development corporations in the primary industry sector. These corporations are responsible for a large part of the CSIRO's external funding. If the CSIRO continues to downgrade agricultural research, it is quite likely that the R&amp;D corporations will pack up their bat and ball and go somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the minister said that the CSIRO's budget is a one-line budget allocation. I think that is probably a little bit too simplistic. The government is responsible for setting priorities for funding. As Senator Schacht interjected earlier, the CSIRO makes up its own mind. I guess that is true, but it is really the government that is ultimately responsible because it is our money and the government is responsible for spending it. We should never forget that. I should close on the point that I fully support Senator Panizza's motion that CSIRO's funding be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the time taken up by an earlier debate today I did not have an opportunity to take note of an answer from Senator Ray, so I take the opportunity now to put it on the public record. The question I asked concerned the closure of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> in Hobart. It may be a small event to those on the government side, and it may not be a great moment in Australia's history, but it certainly means a lot to the people of Hobart&mdash;so much so that some 20,000 signatures have been collected on a petition, which is no mean feat in a population of 158,000-odd. The facility has great historical value for Hobart. Lots of events are occurring and are yet to occur on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the minister's answer today that he is still immovable in his decision to close the facility&mdash;a facility steeped in history. Nevertheless, I suggest to the Senate that I do not believe that the minister has been properly briefed on this matter. He was led to understand that there are going to be savings of $746,000 a year. That is absolutely true; that figure has been quoted often enough. But, as Senator MacGibbon found out in estimates last week, when the services are broken up&mdash;as admitted by Rear Admiral Campbell&mdash;most of the savings are achieved by reducing the number of staff. Out of the savings of $746,000, some $600,000 is tied up with civil and service salaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numbers could have been reduced and the facility still retained. The net cost would have been somewhere around $118,000 to $140,000 a year. The government wants to move certain parts of the facility to Anglesea barracks at a cost of something like $250,000&mdash;a one-off cost. That takes up two years of the $140,000 cost of retention. In three years time the projected $140,000 saving could be reduced by using the provisions of the new Working Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main component of the $140,000 is maintenance on the building. That maintenance could be done as part of a training program. The navy would still have had a presence with HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> on the beautiful Derwent, sitting where it has done for so many years. The minister has already admitted that the diving station and the wharf are going to be retained. So part of the naval operations will be retained anyway and will have to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is going to all this trouble to move HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> up to Anglesea barracks to integrate it with the army and the air force. It has been a sad event as far as the navy personnel in Hobart are concerned. There has been a lot of heartache and a lot of concern, not only from the naval personnel, but from people who have been involved with the navy for many years. The committee to save the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> has been working very hard and is receiving unprecedented community support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone will have to look after the current building. The Department of Employment, Education and Training was mooted as one of the authorities that was going to do so but it has now rejected that and given it the thumbs down. This great, old building is on the state national trust list, which means its retainment is preferable. Someone will have to pay for it. Obviously it will not be the federal government because it has washed its hands of the matter. What a waste of money!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence budget runs into many hundreds of millions of dollars. It is ridiculous that there is all this heartache and dislocation for the sake of $140,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we go to the movies we see advertisements trying to recruit people into the navy. Obviously the need to advertise for recruitment purposes is high on the navy's list of priorities. I guess that the navy spends many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year trying to get young people to enlist. In fact, I have a young nephew who is a lieutenant commander in the navy now who did medicine by using the naval facilities. I have no problem with all that because the senior service is a very fine service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on advertising. It should be realised that per capita Tasmania, and particularly Hobart, has been the biggest and best recruiting ground for the navy over decades. The quality of recruits coming out of there has always been of a very high standard. I think Tasmania's most famous son is Admiral Collins. </PARA>

We have this other cost of $250,000 to transfer to Anglesea barracks, which all pales into insignificance in the total defence budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me commence my remarks this evening by fully endorsing and supporting the comments of my colleague Senator Calvert. As he said, the thing that stands out about the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> issue is the fact that the Australian Labor Party members of the House of Representatives and the Senate are strangely quiet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in joining the adjournment debate tonight is to make further comment in relation to Senator Robert Ray's appallingly pathetic defence of Ms Wood in his answer earlier today. Indeed, Senator Ray's defence of Ms Wood is proof positive of how the ALP dances to the trade union tune. Any government, any minister worthy of the trust placed in him by the Australian people, should be demanding Ms Wood's resignation immediately. To allow her to continue is to condone conduct which can only be described as politically corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia may not be aware that the Trade Union Training Authority is a publicly-funded statutory authority and has an 11-member board, six of whom&mdash;a majority&mdash;are nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In other words, at all times the ACTU has a controlling majority or interest in the Trade Union Training Authority. To use the words of the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, TUTA is an `acolyte' of the ACTU but funded by the taxpayer. That, of course, is a very transparent situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between the ACTU and TUTA is so close that they conspired two weeks prior to the last election to rid Clyde Cameron College of its important library facilities. This gutting of the library facilities was undertaken by Ms Wood without consultation with the library staff. She announced the decision to them on 26 February 1993. Yet she has the audacity to parade as the executive officer of an institution devoted to industrial relations training. By her own conduct TUTA has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Wood, during Senate Estimates Committee B hearings, admitted that she signed the joint venture the day before the last federal election, namely 12 March 1994. The deed was such a ratty document that the solicitors who drew it up, I believe, could well be held responsible but for the fact that undoubtedly they were not given proper and detailed instructions by their clients because it was all done in such a rush. And, as a result, it was revealed that an amending deed was required to make up for the vast number of deficiencies in the original document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Wood admitted that she told the staff about this move, without consultation, 14 days before the election and said that the move was to take place within two weeks. Why two weeks? To circumvent coalition policy which was clearly stated as selling the assets of Clyde Cameron College. She signed an agreement which allowed the ACTU to be an equal partner with TUTA in a business enterprise to which the ACTU only contributed one-sixth of the assets. The taxpayers of Australia brought in five-sixths of the assets. Any common business sense would dictate that that would not be the ground for an equal partnership. However, it does serve to show that there has been blatant political corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the restructuring that TUTA has undergone in recent times has also meant the closure of all state offices except those, surprisingly, located in trade union-owned buildings. If the trade union was the beneficiary of TUTA funds for leases, those offices were retained; any others were, of course, terminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just another example of taxpayer's money going into union coffers which, in turn, sponsor the corrupt Labor government under which this country is suffering. Indeed, during the last election, the director of Clyde Cameron College also happened to be the endorsed Labor candidate for the seat of Indi, a Ms Luck. As justice would have it, she did not win the seat. But this is what the local <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Mail</EMPHASIS> said on 2 March 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Luck hotly denied the claim that the union movement was downgrading the college.</PARA>
<PARA>In anybody's language, taking the library facility away from the training college must have been a downgrading. She said that it was part of the rationalisation that meant that the books, reports and files would be placed in the Trade Union Training Authority's head office in Melbourne. That is another lie. It placed it in the ACTU headquarters, not in TUTA's head office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She then said that the move had been approved by the authority council. That is another lie, which was exposed at Estimates Committee B when Kate Wood acknowledged under questioning that she had not sought the approval of the executive council prior to making the decision, prior to implementing the decision, and prior to signing the deed on 12 March 1993. It was only after the election that the executive council&mdash;which has a majority of ACTU members on it&mdash;retrospectively ratified the agreement. So, once again, Ms Luck, a Labor candidate associated with the ACTU and the Trade Union Training Authority, mislead the people of Indi in the last federal election and therefore mislead the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole situation is just part of the litany of lies the people of Australia have had to put up with from the triumvirate of TUTA, the ACTU and the ALP. I can assure the minister, Senator Ray, and Ms Wood, that they will be hearing a lot more about the political corruption that was engaged in by TUTA at Clyde Cameron College, aided and abetted by the ACTU, because for me to be silent and not pursue it would mean that I would be justifying and condoning their actions of complete deceit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this opportunity to refer to a matter that I raised with the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, today in question time, and that was the quite extraordinary attack on federal government policy in relation to family support programs by people within the government's own ranks, to wit the ACTU President, Martin Ferguson, and the head of the government's Council for the International Year of the Family, Professor Cass, who both questioned and criticised the government's family support programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the minister could give me was a complete non-answer. All she had to say was that there could be a problem, adding, `What we are going to do is do a lot more advertising.' It is absolutely typical of Labor governments that when they have a problem created by their own doing&mdash;in this case, the most complex system of family payments imaginable&mdash;the answer is to throw more taxpayers' money at the problem. `Let us spend a bit more on advertising'&mdash;when the government is running an $11 billion or $12 billion deficit, what is another $1 million or two of taxpayers' money on advertising in the hope that the poor confused voter will understand what it is all about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Advertiser</EMPHASIS> an example of the sort of thing on which the government is spending our money in order to help Australians understand this complex scheme. It is a full page advertisement sponsored by the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;in other words, paid for by the taxpayers. It is really one of a whole series of articles in which the government pats itself on the back for being so wonderful, throwing money around with gay abandon. Interestingly, there is a picture of Rosemary Crowley in the middle of the advertisement. This is just taxpayers' money being used to pay for advertising Labor people&mdash;and my recollection from my campaigning days is that it would have cost about $12,000 a page</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, I would have thought that Senator Schacht, who is sitting opposite, might have a bit of a problem with it because Senator Crowley is using taxpayers' money to promote herself. In South Australia there will be two Centre Left Labor senators on the same ticket&mdash;Senator Schacht and Senator Crowley. With the introduction of PR in South Australia and the big push to have women on Senate tickets, Senator Schacht might have a problem the next time we get around to selecting Labor senators. I guess we will see full page advertisements with Senator Schacht's face so that he can compete with Senator Crowley&mdash;all at our expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government does have an extraordinarily complex system which nobody can understand, as Martin Ferguson quite rightly said. It is starting to look like the infamous Ettamogah Pub&mdash;this most incredible, complex system with everything piled on top of the other, looking like it is going to fall over one day. All the government is doing is piling benefit on benefit and nobody can understand the system. One would think that bureaucrats had deliberately designed it to make it as complex as it could possibly be in order to ensure that they keep their jobs. Perhaps it is really nothing more than a job creation scheme for the Public Service, with bureaucrats designing a system so thoroughly complex that more and more bureaucrats are needed to keep tabs on it and to explain how it will work by writing the advertising copy on which taxpayers' money is also being spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Crowley seems to miss is that it is not only the opposition criticising this incredible, bureaucratic mess; the criticism is coming from within Labor's ranks. We are talking about the ACTU president and the head of the International Year of the Family Council. I want to remind those opposite of what Martin Ferguson said: `One of the problems out in the community is a lack of understanding. You almost need a doctorate in this day and age to understand the different child-care initiatives let alone to see how they can be implemented from household to household.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bettina Cass said, `We need to re-examine the whole complex array of children's payments currently in place with a view to the integration, simplification and strengthening of payments for families with children under school age. The time has come to re-examine the redistributive outcomes of the entire system and to design the most equitable arrangement of family income support when children are under five years.' Bettina Cass seems to be saying that the whole thing is a mess and that we need to toss it out and start again. I think that is probably right. No wonder the government is highly embarrassed by these attacks upon it. These attacks are really quite extraordinary. These are public statements made by people locked into the Labor wheel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is what they are saying publicly, I would hate to think what they are saying privately, and I hate to think what Labor members, trying to wade their way through this, are saying privately. It represents a fairly gross example of failure on the part of the government to have a system like this. The worst part of it, and the reason I raise it, is that it must mean that people in need and people who would otherwise be eligible for some of these benefits are missing out simply because they have no hope of understanding what the requirements and the eligibility rules are. It is a classic case of one of the problems this government has, namely, that it is rapidly losing touch with the voters and with the marketplace&mdash;the people it is there to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the themes we will be pursuing relentlessly as we approach the next election. This government has been in office a very long time, and it is really starting to show. We are talking about a government in office 12 years too long. It is just being taken over by the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats have clearly got hold of this area of policy. Senator Crowley is literally simply presiding over it while the bureaucrats run it in the way that suits their purposes. In this International Year of the Family it is about time the government grasped the opportunity to do something about this incredible mess and sorted it out for Australia's sake and the sake of Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a much simpler way of approaching it. There are many ideas floating around on our side of the fence and, I imagine, probably even on the government's side. I congratulate Tony Abbott, the new member for Warringah on his maiden speech tonight in which he addressed this very issue and called for a family wage to address this very problem&mdash;a universal payment based on the number of children in the family which is paid directly to the primary carer whether or not that person is seeking work in the paid work force. That gives them choice, certainty and security. It is an issue that we must look at on this side of the fence because the government has highlighted in its own words, through Martin Ferguson, the extent of the problem. We will come up with a policy solution, but it would be nice in this International Year of the Family if the government, with all its resources and all its bureaucrats, could finally get it right. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these issues certainly need to be addressed, and this election, therefore, poses that very important point. As the demography of the Northern Territory has changed, and as young people grow and people settle in a community, it is the mining industry, the pastoral industry, the tourist industry, the private sector and also the public service which make a fantastic contribution to what is happening in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current election campaign is very much a nutshell of a decision about a style of life for both the Aboriginal territorians and for territorians generally; a decision about where they want to go for the next 20 years. It certainly invites us to be very critical and poses major problems for voters this year in addressing the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the last decade of Labor's administration in Canberra we are all aware of Labor's hidden agendas. We see the tax on lifestyle and we know the effect it has on people's lives, their urban plans, their jobs and on so many areas that impact on their lives. There are issues on which the Labor Party needs to be challenged. At this stage I have no wish to see any of Labor's priorities or policies transposed into the Northern Territory. They would constrain and hold back the entire development of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very well aware that the Australian Labor Party pledges that a Labor Party government in the Northern Territory would impose on business owners new regulations insisting that they operate within clear social guidelines. What does that mean? It would bring in change for public servants by forcing them to obey strict new judicial review procedures for the public service actions. I will return to that point in a moment. The Labor Party would insist that the first and primary objective of all Labor government policies would be to serve the objective of what is called social justice. We get hung up far too much on those words `social justice'. The Labor Party has made a real dichotomy and a mockery of what that really means in the community by hiding behind adjectives rather than measuring them on the social and the economic advantages of any group of people and how they would operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory does not need significant change in the areas of its social or economic agenda. The fact is that the Northern Territory has had such a very special relationship with Asia and will continue to show the way for the entire Australian continent. I recall a discussion at lunchtime today with my colleague Senator O'Chee who talked about the landmark international decisions, arrangements and treaties that have been made between the Northern Territory and Indonesia, our nearest neighbour. These stand as a credit to the Northern Territory. What does the Labor Party do? It confuses the argument by constantly wanting to do special deals on East Timor and disrupt such important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the main area that worries me most profoundly about Labor Party policies and initiatives for the Northern Territory is what would happen to the very independent, special and proud public service of the Northern Territory. For over a decade in Canberra we have seen evidence of Labor's reputation of jobs for the boys in the Public Service. That should serve as a special warning for territorians. The federal Public Service, in both Canberra and the Northern Territory, is stacked&mdash;this has become much more recently accommodated&mdash;with political appointees and this is evidence of Labor's heavy-handed approach to the Public Service. I am fearful that if Labor was to win government in the Northern Territory that same heavy hand of Labor would come down on the Northern Territory's own public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently investigated two very special incidents in this parliament. Senator Schacht will recall some questions that were placed on notice concerning the federal Department of Employment, Education and Training the other day with regard to the appointment of the director of the Northern Territory area office. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Snowdon, who happens to be the federal member for the Northern Territory, has very obviously overridden the selection processes. It is alleged that staff selection processes were tampered with in both the Northern Territory and our first cousin at Christmas Island in order to develop a Labor network of mates in the Public Service. It has been alleged to me that in the two specific cases that I have been reviewing these selection processes were manipulated in favour of more politically suitable candidates. At the Senate estimates committee I called that into question in the DEET area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of employment, sport and territories, we have seen the appointment of Mr Danny Gillespie as the administrator of Christmas Island without any recourse whatsoever to advertising or the normal processes. Mr Gillespie is well known for his activities in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and, more recently, in the Shoalwater Bay inquiry in Queensland. Obviously Mr Snowdon picked him up without recourse to any area. I question this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today there are thousands of young territorians who have, in the last 20 years, invested their time in university studies and career paths. They should not be threatened by Labor's deliberate policy of recruiting out of work mates from failed Labor regimes in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria or Canberra. At the same time, let me give credit to the majority of very hardworking federal public servants in the Northern Territory. There are a number of them, but I am fearful that this habit of special placement will have an impact on so many young careers in the Northern Territory. Our own public service has a proud and independent record&mdash;one that cannot be risked under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also astounded that the Public Service Union secretary, Janet Crews, accused me in the media last weekend of public service bashing when what she is doing is failing to represent the interests of her Northern Territory members. I suggest that she takes a very close look at the issues that I pursue in this place, such as the waste of taxpayers' money, the DEET housing sale scandal that blew up recently in the face of the Labor government, and any breaches of government recruitment guidelines and ethics, such as those that have now become so transparent by what Mr Snowdon has done. This is a case of the PSU lying doggo as a matter of Labor convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is an important election for the Northern Territory. There are important issues at stake. The most important issue is for young territorians to be confident that in the next 20 years they can enjoy the same social and economic progress as they have enjoyed for the last 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I have received a number of letters and copies of letters to my predecessors from the Friends of the Earth, including to the letter addressed to Minister Kelly dated 16 February 1994 and the accompanying press release.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The conditions placed on the development of the mine and its ongoing management were the responsibility of the South Australian Government under the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) (a) Yes. The Department has received the Olympic Dam Operations&mdash;Environmental Management Programme Annual Report&mdash;01/03/89 to 28/02/90 dated March 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Report indicated that except for some anomalous readings, a lowering of water levels from the mine to the outside peripheral bores was observed during the year. The anomalous readings included bores north and southeast of the tailings retention system. The report states that heavy rainfall in March 1989 caused the water level in many of the observation bores, especially the peripheral bores, to rise as compared to levels recorded in April 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The design and operation of the tailings retention system at Olympic Dam mine has clearly been inadequate. On 15 February 1994 the previous Minister wrote to the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy requesting a full report on the problem of water seepage from the tailings retention system and how it was being addressed. On 16 March 1994 the previous Minister invited the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy to report on matters not addressed in the previous report he had provided. On 3 May the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and I wrote again to the South Australian Minister welcoming the advice he had given to Senator Collins that we would be provided with a full report by the South Australian Government within two weeks. Further information has not yet been received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The responsibility for environmental standards and supervision of the mine rests with the South Australian Government under the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. In my statement of 14 March, I said " . . . all these questions of nomenclature will, of course, have to be revisited when the name issue is finally resolved, as we all hope it soon will be, in negotiations between the FYROM and Greece".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) UNSC Resolution 817 of 7 April 1993 approved the admission to the UN of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under that temporary name. Resolution 845 of 18 June 1993 urged the Governments of Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to continue their efforts under the auspices of the Secretary General to arrive at a speedy settlement of the remaining issues between them. On 15 February 1994, Australia recognised the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) under that temporary name. Australia's recognition followed that of 58 other countries, including every other member of the European Union and the United States, the majority of which recognised the Republic under the temporary name of the FYROM, the name under which it was admitted to the UN. As I indicated in my statement of 14 March, since the Government did not accept the name "Republic of Macedonia" as an appropriate one for the country itself, it simply was not appropriate to refer to its people as "Macedonians". But it was made equally clear that all these questions of nomenclature would have to be revisited when the issue was finally resolved, as we all hope it soon will be, in negotiations between the FYROM and Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) To my knowledge, no other government has issued such a directive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) None, other than from the FYROM itself which considered the decision discriminatory and regretted the possible effects it could have on relations between the two communities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) To my knowledge, the answer is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No comparison can be drawn between the Government's decision and the situation of minority groups in Greece. All ethnic communities in Australia benefit and will continue to benefit under the Government's policy of multiculturalism, including the right to self-identification, irrespective of the internal political or human rights situations in their countries of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Prime Minister, Senator Bolkus and I met representatives from the Slav-Macedonian and associated organisations and individuals prior to the Government's announcement that a directive would be issued. The Government did not consult the Government of the FYROM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The decision to issue an operational directive on administrative matters does not require public debate, discussion or consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) As outlined in (2) above, as the Government did not accept the name "Republic of Macedonia" as an appropriate name for the country, it was simply not appropriate to refer to its people as "Macedonians". I noted in my statement of 14 March, that the term `Slav Macedonian' was a shorthand reference for the country's temporary name, the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia". It is not designed as an ethnic reference. How ordinary members of the respective communities choose to describe their ethnicity, in a census, or anywhere else, will remain up to those individuals and communities themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) See (2) and (9).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The term "Slav Macedonian" is one that is used in historical and scholarly literature in a neutral way. The Government's use of the term is not meant to be considered as an ethnic identifier, nor is not designed to have any offensive connotation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) See (2), (9) and (11).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The costs are unknown, but it is expected that they will be minimal and will be absorbed in the budgets of relevant Departments and Agencies as part of their normal administrative expenses like all other administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The decision establishes an unambiguous descriptor for people living in, or coming from, the FYROM&mdash;until the name issue is resolved between the Governments in Athens and Skopje.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) I am not aware of claims that aspects of the bureaucracy have had a negative impact on the Slav-Macedonian community.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) In preparation of my announcement on 14 March in the Senate of the Government's decision to direct Government Departments and Agencies to refer, for the time being, to the country as "the FYROM" and to people living in or originating from it as "Slav-Macedonians" the Government received oral advice from its legal advisers that this decision would not contravene the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) None. See also (18).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) No legislation will be enacted to compel any particular usage, by Government Departments and Agencies, or anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the assumption that the Secretary of a Department has issued a lawful and reasonable directive, officers of that Department are obliged to comply. Failure to comply with such a directive may lead to formal disciplinary proceedings against an officer under the Public Service Act. Whether formal disciplinary proceedings were instituted would depend on the nature of the officer's actions and the context in which those actions were taken. It may be, for instance, that the matter would be more appropriately dealt with by informal counselling rather than formal disciplinary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) Provision is made in the Public Service Commission's Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants for an officer to refuse to comply with a lawful directive on the grounds of conscientious objection. In these circumstances, the officer concerned should approach his or her supervisor with a view to being exempted of the duties requiring compliance with the directive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) No. However, the Prime Minister, Senator Bolkus and I met with representatives from the Greek community and, subsequently, representatives of the Slav Macedonian and associated organisations and individuals prior to the announcement of the Government's decision. No other Government was approached on the content of the directive or the decision to issue it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) The form DA 560 is used currently as an application for an exemption against an Airworthiness Directive, Civil Aviation Order (CAO), or as an application for equivalent safety. Equivalent safety refers to, for example, carrying out maintenance of an aircraft in a different manner to that prescribed in the CAOs, but achieving the same level of safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(b) &amp; (c) The only DA 560 concession in respect of aircraft VH-NDU was issued on 12 October 1990. A copy, which explains the details of the concession, has been provided to the honourable senator and additional copies are available from the Tables Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(d) to (i) The information sought by Senator Macdonald on the specific details of investigations in relation to Monarch Airlines Limited clearly forms part of the investigation being conducted by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and the work to be carried out during the coronial inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore inappropriate at this stage to provide this material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view was supported by the advice from the Clerk of the Senate to the Chair of Senate Estimates Committee E on 1 November 1993. He noted that there is a problem of inquiries by investigatory agencies being prejudiced by parliamentary debate or inquiry. He also noted that there was the possibility of prejudice to proceedings arising in relation to (coronial) inquests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has recently issued a final draft report on the crash of the Monarch Airlines aircraft to designated interested parties directly involved in the accident and/or its immediate aftermath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the Air Navigation Regulations this is not a public release document. Interested parties have 21 days to make comment to the Bureau on the content and findings of the draft accident report. Those comments may lead to modification of the draft  report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A copy of the final draft report was made available to the Shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp after Mr Sharp provided a written undertaking that he would treat the draft report on a confidential basis and for his information only. It should be noted that any public disclosure, or passing the document on to anyone else, constitutes a breach of Air Navigation Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that the final report will be publicly released in July. A copy will be provided to Senator Macdonald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coronial inquiry is scheduled to commence in August this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) An application for permissible unserviceability is required by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to be made in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(b) The Authority would ask the operator to supply information as to the effect of removal of the components on the aircraft and its systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response would then have been verified by reference to any approved data held on the respective aircraft, and/or by checking the components and the effect of removal of these on the aircraft and its systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If no access to the aircraft was available, confirmation of the operator's information, as supplied, would have been sought from a Licensed Engineer rated on the aircraft and its systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What conditions might be imposed depends on the circumstances surrounding the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) In the case of this particular Qantas Boeing 747 aircraft, there was no impact on the safety of the aircraft operation, because no other electrical systems failed. If there had been electrical failures, the standby inverter would have been required to provide electrical power essential for the safe operation of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(b) &amp; (c) In Sydney, the aircraft remained on ground power. Therefore, the pre flight checks were commenced at a point where the missing inverter was not detected. Unlike Sydney, in Los Angeles the aircraft was not connected to ground power and the missing inverter was detected during the pre flight checks. The operator was advised of the deficiency and the flight crew have been provided with retraining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(d) The Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME), who certified for the replacement of the inverter in Australia, was asked by the CAA to show cause why his LAME licence should not be varied or cancelled. He was interviewed by the CAA, and then made a further statement in relation to the incident. His LAME file records the incident. No further action was considered necessary by the CAA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) The LAME acknowledged that he'd carried out the maintenance without reference to any data. As such he could see no reason to adjust the "weight on wheels" switches. After appraisal of the ramifications of his actions he realised the seriousness of the incident. He has been counselled and his LAME file annotated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second part of this question concerning procedures being adopted to ensure that similar incidences do not occur again, the operator's maintenance records now refer to the requirement to check the switches, and a signature is now required to confirm attention to the maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(b) Yes. There is a "weight on wheels" malfunction procedure, and the correct procedure was followed by the pilots on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) In deciding to locate the safety regulatory function within the CAA, the Government took the view that the task of regulating safety must be regarded as an integrated system in which all elements are coordinated to achieve maximum reliability and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the findings of the Terrell Report, the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation is presently implementing a range of initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the CAA's safety regulatory role. These initiatives received the support of industry and unions at a round table meeting held on 1 September 1993. The effectiveness of these changes should be given the opportunity to be tested before further changes are contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(a) The classification of an occurrence into a particular category is primarily an assessment of the resources the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) is prepared to put into the investigation of the specific occurrence. The assessment is based primarily, but not exclusively on the degree of threat posed by the occurrence to the safety of fare paying passengers and the general public. An occurrence classified as a category 1 investigation can generally be considered to have posed a significant threat to safety. A category 1 investigation will involve a full international standard investigation. An occurrence classified as a category 5 investigation can generally be considered to have posed a minimum threat to safety. A category 5 investigation will involve the minimum degree of effort to register the fact that the specific occurrence has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Category 3 is the mid point between Category 1 and Category 5 and as such, a category 3 classification serves two purpose. Firstly it is used as a holding classification whereby preliminary investigation may result in the upgrading or downgrading of the classification. Secondly a classification of category 3 is a classification in its own right under which many investigations are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, category 1 and 2 classification are subject to full investigations while category 4 and 5 occurrences are not subject to any detailed investigation. Category 3 occurrences are generally only subject to partial investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matrix of investigation classifications is used to determine which type of occurrences get classified into which category. A copy of the matrix is at Table 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(b) The increase in the number of category 3 occurrences is attributable to a subtle change in the manner of occurrence classification described in the answer to the honourable senator's previous question ((a) question 1290). The increase does not represent any change in the overall number of occurrences or the broad status of aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the answer to the previous question, the classification of "category 3" was described as having two roles. That is, a holding category for subsequent upgrading or downgrading, and also as a response category in its own right. This use of the categories was implemented in the latter part of 1992. Prior to 1992, category 2 was used as the holding category. By virtue of the fact that most of the occurrences assigned to a holding category are finalised within that category the subtle change referred to above leads to a situation where occurrences that would have been classified as category 2 occurrences in 1991 were in 1993 categorised as category 3 occurrences. From the figures provided to the honourable senator in response to Question 833 (see Table 2) it can be seen that between 1991 and 1993 the number of category 2 occurrences decreased as the number of category 3 occurrences increased. Summation of the category 2 and 3 occurrences indicates that for 1991, 1992 and 1993, there was no significant change in the combined number of occurrences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not bringing the change in classification treatment to the honourable senator's notice at the time of providing him with the information in answer to Question 833 was an oversight by BASI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(c) The Bureau is unable to provide any meaningful answer to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) To further clarify the previous response, the CAA restructuring policy was predicated upon having District Offices close to where the surveillance activity is required. There are two major disciplines requiring surveillance in an airline&mdash;Airworthiness (engineering) and Flight Operations (flight deck, flight attendants and the operator's organisation and facilities).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airworthiness/engineering is a ground-based activity and can, therefore, be surveilled by the nearest CAA District Office. Eastern Airlines has their major engineering and maintenance activities at Tamworth, and thus it is more appropriate to have these activities oversighted by the CAA's Airworthiness staff located at Tamworth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of flight operations activities, these are centred at Kingsford Smith Airport, and are, therefore, oversighted by the CAA's Flight Operations staff at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(b) No, it is not a fact. The CAA's restructuring policy was based upon all activities in the Tamworth area, which number some 60 aviation companies and some 500 registered aircraft. Eastern Airlines is only one such organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(c) Flight Operations surveillance is aimed at ensuring that Flight Crew standards are in accordance with all Civil Aviation Regulations and Civil Aviation Orders applying to Flight Operations. This includes not only the oversight of pilots/flight engineers, but also the flight attendants' activities, together with the operator's facilities and organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airworthiness surveillance refers to the oversight of the aircraft systems, engineering and ground support functions in accordance with all Civil Aviation Regulations and Civil Aviation Orders applying to Airworthiness.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a)-(d) The Honourable Senator's question relates in the main to the alleged irregularities at the Qantas Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME) Training School in Sydney. However, part (b) refers to a letter from Mr Alldis, Technical Manager, Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA), about "leaked exam papers and possible cheating in July 1993". This particular matter raised by Mr Alldis was, in fact, referring to a Boeing 747-400 engine/airframe training course, which was being run in Melbourne for Qantas engineering staff and engineering staff from the newly merged Australian Airlines, not the Qantas AME Training School in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to clarify the situation for the Honourable Senator, this response details both matters, and the action taken by the CAA to address both matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 July 1993, Mr Alldis telephoned Mr Richard Purdie, Manager, AME Personnel Licensing, at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), to advise him of alleged irregularities with the Boeing 747-400 training course in Melbourne. Mr Alldis followed up with a facsimile letter to Mr Purdie on 26 July 1993 alleging that examination question papers were being circulated amongst trainees attending the Melbourne training course. A copy of this letter is provided, as requested by the Honourable Senator and additional copies are available from the Tables Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 July 1993, Mr Purdie wrote to the Qantas Quality Assurance Manager requiring Qantas to produce new examinations for the Boeing 747-400 training course in Melbourne, and to reformat the existing questions in the examination library.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA became aware during late December that the ALAEA and Qantas had met to discuss alleged irregularities at the Qantas AME Training School in Sydney. On 22 December 1993, Qantas advised the CAA of a possible breach of AME examination security, following the meeting. Mr Alldis also wrote to the CAA concerning the matters that had arisen at the meeting. A copy of the minutes of the meeting were not obtained until mid-January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January 1994, Mr Beaver commenced a formal inquiry into the alleged irregularities involving examinations at the Qantas AME Training School.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has had in place a Ballast Water Monitoring and Testing Program since 1991. This program has been aimed primarily at identifying toxic dinoflagellates, which have to date been considered the most serious threat to Australia as they can affect human health and seafood production.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The forestry policy of the Myanmar Government does not provide for the sale of timber concessions and, with the exception of the Thai/Myanmar border area, no foreign entity has been authorised to harvest forest resources inside Myanmar.  The practice of private sector tendering  for approved harvesting of timber other than teak, which was reintroduced in 1988 following exclusion of the private sector from exploitation of forest resources for many years, was brought to an end in 1993 pending further review of policy and restructuring in the timber extraction industry.  The Myanmar Timber Enterprise is currently the sole agency authorised to extract commercial timber resources throughout Myanmar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following consultations with the Thai Government in 1990 on measures to combat the problem of illegal poaching of timber in the border areas, the Myanmar Government allocated approximately 50 Thai companies the right to extract fixed quotas of timber in accordance with official  forest rules in specified zones on the Thai/Myanmar border. Unsatisfactory compliance with the terms of these concessions led the Myanmar Government to terminate all such concessions with effect from the end of 1993. The Myanmar Government is currently reviewing forestry policy in the border areas in the context of border area development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Only Thai companies were authorised to extract timber under the arrangements outlined in the response to part (1) above. Although some of the Thai companies reportedly subcontracted their permits, we are not aware of any Australian companies having been involved in the extraction of timber in the border areas under those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The zones in which Thai companies were authorised to operate were all located along the 1300 miles of common border between Myanmar and Thailand. We do not know the size of these zones. According to Myanmar authorities, no area was subject to clear felling, as the abundance of prime quality timber from mainly virgin forest made this practice both unnecessary and uneconomical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) We are aware of claims that there have been forced relocations of ethnic groups in the border region. While our information on border areas which are only now coming under the control of the Myanmar Government is not complete, so far we do not have evidence that relocations have been directly related to logging activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) On the basis of information available, including from international organisations working in Myanmar, the Government is not aware of the extent of the impact on the natural environment of Myanmar resulting in particular from logging practices in the border areas. The environmental problems in Myanmar arising from forest degradation and loss of forest cover are nonetheless severe. They appear to be most pronounced in those areas affected by population pressure, which are subject to increased fuel wood requirements, the encroachment of agriculture and "slash and burn" cultivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In the absence of first hand information the Government has no means of assessing the effect of logging in the border regions on the viability of village life for ethnic communities in those areas.  While there are over 72,000 displaced people from Myanmar in camps along the border, most displaced people cite forced labour or porterage, rather than illegal logging, as the reason for leaving their villages. The priority attached by the Myanmar Government to reafforestation and the development of domestic fuel wood supply plantations suggests that the Myanmar authorities are seized of the urgency of arresting the loss of forest cover, which currently stands at approximately 32.4 million hectares or approximately 50 per cent of the total land surface area of Myanmar.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Plans to develop dams along the Salween River to augment energy and water supplies available to Northern Thailand and Myanmar have been canvassed for many years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) We have no hard evidence to support claims that ethnic Burmese refugees within Thailand have been relocated to accommodate the proposed route of the pipeline. The Australian Embassies in Bangkok and Yangon are following up claims by the "National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma" that a number of villages in Myanmar's Tenasserim Division have been relocated because of the pipeline construction project.

Use of off-island facilities generates a range of disadvantages, not the least being security of expensive sensitive equipment and increased flying times over built-up areas. An overall assessment of these and other disadvantages, lead to the selection of Garden Island for the site of the facility, in accordance with the plans previously subjected to public environmental assessment in 1989.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) The labels of heptachlor and chlordane products include a statement to the effect that sale or supply and use is for licenced pest control operators only. Although, in some circumstances State Authorities have the power to permit their use by a person who can demonstrate equal competency to use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (Council) agreed at its April 1994 meeting that the use of organochlorine chemicals for termite control in all States and Territories except the Northern Territory should cease on 30 June 1995. The target date for discontinuing their use in the Northern Territory is 30 June 1997. An extension of time has been allowed in the Northern Territory to allow alternative methods of control to be developed to suit local environmental conditions and building practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision affects the chemicals heptachlor and chlordane as aldrin and dieldrin were withdrawn from the Australian market some years ago.</PARA>
