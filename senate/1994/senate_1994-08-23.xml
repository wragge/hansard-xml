<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and relates to drought. Can the minister explain the Prime Minister's inconsistencies and the government's lack of understanding of the extent of severe drought in Australia? Why did Mr Keating last month state that the current severe drought is almost part of managing rural enterprise, is not an intermittent disaster and is a normal recurrence of rural life? If Senator Evans agrees with the Prime Minister when he said that crying crocodile tears about drought affected areas is not going to help people, how will the paltry assistance so far announced by the government provide genuine relief assistance for the entire communities and the rural families affected by the severe drought and not be merely bandaid measures?</PARA></TALK.START>

I might add that that assistance was promptly forthcoming and warmly welcomed by the primary industry sector. In fact, the newly elected President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr McGauchie, was quoted on the front page of the same newspaper welcoming the Prime Minister's statement. The Prime Minister, in fact, was responding to a question about whether drought should be removed from the current arrangements in the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme and go back to the old procedure of simply defining it as a natural disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane has waved around to my astonishment, presumably in support of this question, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs on a national drought policy, which report positively recommends that drought not be returned to the natural disasters category. Instead of waving these things around, why does he not read them? It is a big ask, I agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement that drought, along with fires and floods, is a natural and normal part of the cycles of the Australian pastoral landscape is unarguably correct.

It can be the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who throws around all his foreign aid on bridges across the rivers in the Mekong, which bears no comparison in financial terms to the amount of money that is being given to drought situations. My question, which was not answered, is: how will the paltry assistance&mdash;give us some figures; compare it to the Mekong bridge, if you like&mdash;so far announced give genuine relief for the entire communities and rural families affected by drought relief and not be merely a bandaid measure? Does the minister support the Prime Minister, or does he support the thousands of struggling farmers who know first-hand of this drought and of the catastrophic effects it is having on the farming community?

Let me tell Senator Tambling this: trade is a two-way street. Senator Tambling may be interested to know that China is currently the biggest single customer for Australian wool in the world. Our trade with Asia is currently the most important trade that Australia has in agriculture and primary industry. A large number of ministers are engaged at the moment in extremely important dialogue with ministers from Indonesia about that trade. Trade is a two-way street, not a one-way street.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Given the recent indication of the strength of economic recovery in Australia, will the government review its economic targets, particularly for employment and business growth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we will not review those targets. What should be said is that the Australian economy is performing extremely well. We are now having a self-sustaining recovery in Australia which bodes well for everyone in this country. According to the March quarter statistics, the last available statistics for GDP growth, we are growing at five per cent. Importantly, on the last available statistics, that is a 1.7 per cent inflation rate, so we have high growth and low inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, having talked to a number of economic ministers in OECD countries over the past month, that we are the envy of the OECD in terms of our economic fundamentals. In fact, Australia's average GDP growth of 3.3 per cent over the past 10 years is considerably higher than the OECD average of 2.8 per cent for the same period; and forecasts of growth in the coming years for Australia are well above the OECD average for that term as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the lags in the operation of monetary policy, the increase in official cash rates last week was necessary to help underlying inflation and to keep underlying inflation at between two and three per cent over the course of the cycle in order to sustain the growth over the medium term. It will also ensure that the inflation stick, which we broke in this country three years ago, will remain broken and that inflation will remain low as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add that factor to some of the other economic fundamentals, we see that the profit share as a percentage of GDP is high in Australia; that industrial disputes in Australia are at Depression period levels, that is, pre-Second World War levels&mdash;very low indeed, and going south as we speak; that business and consumer confidence equally in this country is very high; and that investment is on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important consequence of the strong economic growth is strong employment creation. More people are employed now in jobs in Australia than ever before. That is an important statistic to be recognised. The labour force data in July showed an exceptionally large increase in employment with a corresponding drop in the unemployment rate to 9.5 per cent. One would always say on month-to-month figures that there is some volatility which must be taken into account and that one should pay attention to the trends here, but in trend terms employment has grown very strongly and is 3.3 per cent higher than in July 1993. Nearly 320,000 jobs have been created since March 1993. This is well on the way towards achieving the government's objective of half a million jobs in the three years from the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good news about the economy is often translated by the opposition into bad news. The 17 per cent fall in Mr Downer's approval rating during the recess is a mirror to that type of bad news. When one looks at the opposition's economic policies, one sees that it has a policy of seeking to be all things to all people&mdash;high expenditure to the interest group it is talking to, tax cuts for everyone, and a reduced deficit as well, a totally unachievable scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the opposition has been running its political line on the economy is opportunist in the extreme. When we know that this comes from someone such as Mr Downer, who was an adviser to the Fraser government which concluded its term with the trifecta of double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and negative economic growth, and when we look at the opposition's position on the economy, it can be seen that its policy could only devastate the advantages that we have so carefully built up.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the government's decision to alter the prudential arrangements for home borrowing so as effectively to require now a minimum 20 per cent deposit, and hence therefore deny most first home buyers the opportunity to purchase a family home. Why has the government sought to single out first home buyers by this savage move to ration home lending? What will be the interest rate cost of this move for mortgagees with less than 20 per cent equity? How many borrowers will be affected by it? Finally, when the Treasurer said last Sunday that anything less than a 20 per cent deposit was risky, was he referring to the risk being a fall in the home buyers' earnings or a collapse in asset prices, or&mdash;perhaps the most likely of all&mdash;a further rapid rise in interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say about this that the change in the prudential ratio that has been adopted by the banks is a perfectly understandable and sensible precaution in a situation where it just is the known case that too many home borrowers, home loan seekers, have been over-extending themselves. The result of the banking experience in recent years has been such that it makes perfect sense from the banks' point of view and from the government's point of view to ensure that that does not occur on the same scale in future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not mean that we are anticipating any flowthrough of the current interest rate increase to home loan lending. There is absolutely no reason to believe that that should occur in the foreseeable future, given the competitive pressures that are at work in the housing market and given that the margins that presently exist between the borrowing rates and the lending rates are still so comfortable for the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sense, of course, in which it is important for the larger management of the economy that some moneys in the banking system be directed to productive business investment rather than being concentrated as intensely in the housing market as they have been in the past. I guess to that extent also there is a policy rationale for introducing some element of caution in that prudential ratio issue. But beyond that, the interest rate consequences for first home buyers obviously will not be great so long as the expectations are&mdash;and I have indicated that it is proper to expect this will be the case&mdash;that home loan interest rates will remain low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steps that the government has taken to increase the official cash rates do, of course, have their own economic rationale: it is good, sensible monetary management to anticipate the 12- to 18-month surge in the business cycle. We have experienced that often enough in the past. We have not acted early enough in the past to anticipate that and to seek to smooth it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about acting as we have is to create an economic environment in which the present level of inflation will be sustainable at a low level and we will not get interest rates rising across the banking sector generally and the housing market in particular to anything like the same extent that we have experienced in the past. So the prudential thing should be seen just as a small part of a larger interrelated strategy with all those different elements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister seriously saying&mdash;because that is the effect of the policy&mdash;that the change in the prudential arrangements to require purchasers of homes to have a minimum 20 per cent deposit will not make it extremely difficult, particularly for young first home buyers, to raise the money necessary to get a housing loan in the first instance? Does the minister accept or not accept that home owners, particularly first home owners, are going to be hurt by this policy decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It just is the case that in the past, as all too many of us are unhappily aware from information available or constituency cases we have had to look after, people have overreached themselves by borrowing too much money on much too small an initial deposit. Banks in the past have been all too happy to accommodate what have not been very prudential borrowing expeditions by the home borrowers in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point remains that, with the present rate of housing loans averaging 8 1/2 per cent or something of that order of magnitude at the moment, with the economy in its present condition with the fundamentals as sound as they are, with steps having been taken, as they have been taken by the government, to anticipate an increase in inflationary and interest rate pressures in the future, to spread it out over time in the way that I have indicated we are doing, there is every reason to expect that those low levels of interest rates will be maintained. And that is the benefit that really matters so far as first home buyers are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial deposit is one element, obviously, in the buying equation. But a much bigger element is the basic rate of interest and in that respect the opposition ought to be reasonably confident&mdash;we are.</PARA>

It will incorporate a major TAFE college, a campus for the University of Western Sydney and two separate senior high schools to be run by the New South Wales government and the Catholic Education Commission.

Can the minister advise the Senate what action the government has taken to safeguard the health and wellbeing of women participating in the RU486 trials?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question. The government is particularly concerned to maintain levels of standards about women's health, and particularly the safety and wellbeing of women and all services provided for them in this country. Three clinical trials of the drug RU486 are being conducted. The drug is being examined as a post-coital contraceptive and as an abortifacient. Those trials have been scrutinised by the ethics committees of Family Planning, New South Wales, and Family Planning, Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been expressions of concern from the community about the trials and, as a result of their being raised, the government has obtained copies of the informed consent documentation and information on the procedures for clearing the trials with the institutions' ethics committees. The department has also obtained advice about whether the requirements set down in law have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Attorney-General's Department has confirmed that the legal requirements in all respects have been met in the conduct of these trials. But in examining the material provided to government, it became clear that the patient information for the abortifacient trial could have been clearer to lay readers and contained more information. Secondly, while the ethics committees were properly constituted and behaved entirely within the law, as required, it is true that one member of the Victorian committee, a minister of religion, did not attend meetings when the decisions about RU486 trials were made and had no input in any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of that information, the government has moved very quickly to act in this matter. It has secured the agreement of Family Planning, Victoria, first of all, to conduct an independent review of the whole consent process; secondly, to contact women who have so far been part of the trial and offer them counselling; and, thirdly, to suspend any further recruitment of women for the trial until the review is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter has been sent to all ethics committees supervising trials, reminding them of the need to ensure that the trials are strictly in accordance with the NHMRC guidelines. The letter emphasises the importance of user-friendly information, particularly in the consent form area, and the requirement that all consent be totally voluntary. There is no evidence that it has not been voluntary, but these are two areas of major concern in relation to consent and the letter highlights both of these points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health has recently announced a wide-ranging review of the NHMRC guidelines for ethics committees to ensure that they also adequately protect the safety of participants in trials and to ensure that genuinely informed consent is obtained in all cases. We have required that ethics committees be established in all institutions. What is important now is to ensure that the monitoring of the processes and behaviour of those ethics committees is as up to scratch as it can be. In particular, as I say, we need to highlight the area of concern that has been most importantly raised, and that is genuinely informed consent from people involved in any of the trials. As well, that review will look at the Australian Health Ethics Committee's arrangements for monitoring and enforcing those ethics committees' behaviours and performances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are particularly concerned that the health of Australian women, particularly those involved in trials to do with reproductive health, is the best it can be; that they are offered information and assurance to participate in these trials; and that they have an opportunity to give fully informed consent to participate. Secondly, the review is part of our ongoing and continuing concern for the safety and wellbeing of all Australian women. Trials like this have a part in contributing to access to other procedures for further safety. We must be absolutely sure that all processes in trying to find out information as part of these trials also support the safety and wellbeing of Australian women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As Senator Evans seemed to be asking for a question on the government's policy of pushing up interest rates again, I ask: did he and his government not learn the lesson last time that rising interest rates particularly hurt small business through rising overdrafts, and medium to low income earners through rising housing loan interest? Did the government not learn that lesson on the last occasion? What evidence of inflationary pressure did the government rely upon in the light of the Master Builders Association's quarterly economic review which has found that residential building is expected to slump by 11 per cent, or almost $2 billion, during the coming year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="8" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case in relation to residential building, it indicates that the demand on housing stock has passed its peak and so we are highly unlikely to run into particular difficulties in that respect with the kind of issue that Senator Short was talking about before. More generally on the question of interest rates, it is not a matter of the government seeking or working to push up interest rates. It is a matter of the government engaging in sensible, prudential, long-term economic management of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that interest rates are still at relatively low levels, with the official cash rate only three-quarters of a percentage point now above what it has been at its lowest level for 20 years. Three-month bill rates are also close to their lowest level for 20 years. The 10-year bond rates are well below their levels which prevailed right through the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is involved in all of this is an effort to anticipate what is going to happen with the economic cycle. We all know that these cycles in the past have had 12 to 18 months to take their effect&mdash;that interest rate increases of any kind have an effect only 12 to 18 months out. What we have to do is try to anticipate where the cycle is going to be. It is a reasonable expectation, given present rates of growth and all that we anticipate about likely surges of investment and so on over the next few months, that there will be some pressure on the supply side. Supply constraints will be showing up over that particular time frame, needing accordingly some adjustment&mdash;an adjustment that has to be made now because of the lags that are involved&mdash;to smooth the peak rate of that particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is all about. What we want to do is ensure that growth in this country is sustainable at high levels and that we do not move up to excessively high peaks and, as a result, the excessively low troughs that follow. It is always a matter of judgment what the particular rate increase is going to be. It seems that the 0.75 per cent increase in the official cash rates announced a little while ago slightly exceeded market expectations. That means that all the heat has gone out of any current expectations about further increases for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market has responded well. The commentators have responded well. It has been seen to be a prudential, sensible exercise in economic management. Of course, it takes place against an environment in which the economic fundamentals in this country are such as to give us all enormous confidence that this situation can be sustained. We have an economy growing at five per cent at the moment&mdash;and certainly going to exceed the budget expectations for growth; we have inflation running at 1.7 per cent; we have unemployment down to 9.5 per cent. We have job growth&mdash;376,000 jobs since we were re-elected 15 months ago. We have a four per cent job growth rate, the second fastest in the OECD.</PARA>

The truth of the matter is that in this country, for as long as anyone can remember&mdash;including through all the dark years of the management of those opposite&mdash;interest rates have always been significantly higher than in many other countries because we have always been a mainstream significant capital importer; and it has been part of the structure of the economy to require that at base levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the actions of Senator Crane today at question time it is obvious they have forgotten. Drought was removed from the NDRA in 1989. That decision was endorsed subsequently by a drought policy review task force comprising Commonwealth, state and industry representatives. It was finally implemented by a decision of ACANZ in 1992. That unanimous decision was reached by all state and federal ministers in 1992. There was no dissent. The Senate also examined the matter in a bipartisan way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflect on what the Prime Minister said in Queensland and listen to what the report that Senator Crane is waving around says about drought. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs report recommended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . drought should not be reinstated within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements as this would compromise the development of a self-reliant,  risk management approach to drought.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It did not really matter whether drought fell within the natural disaster relief arrangements or not, as long as the Commonwealth government realised that it has to give some assistance once the economic capabilities of individuals were unable to cope with a drought.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Senator Brownhill's statement, which was uttered only a short time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point is that the essence of the national drought policy, which was endorsed by all federal and state ministers for agriculture in July 1992, is that the government has a role when drought exceeds that which a farmer can be expected to manage&mdash;that is normal drought. The policy explicitly acknowledges the role of RAS in supplying support in times of severe drought through the exceptional circumstances provisions of RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the MPI that is being run this afternoon, I might add that the Premier of New South Wales, after a tour of drought affected areas of New South Wales, called for the extension of the exceptional circumstances help from the Commonwealth government, which was immediately provided. In recognition of the fact that many of the problems facing rural Australia are regionally based, the government has introduced a regional dimension to RAS. I recently announced the provision of a $9 million package for restructuring in south-west Queensland&mdash;most of which is drought affected&mdash;and I have made a similar offer to the north-west region of New South Wales, and I hope the New South Wales government accepts that. The recent $14 million which was promptly provided in additional assistance by the federal government immediately after I came back from Queensland brings direct federal government assistance to over $50 million that has been provided to drought affected farmers since 1992.</PARA>

But there are further structural problems&mdash;not simply the one that Senator Boswell just mentioned&mdash;that have been raised.

That is what I said in Queensland. It is interesting to look at this question of the assets test. I am fascinated by the Democrats' position on this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will point out the facts. The government has already made provision for a 50 per cent discount on the farm and business assets under Austudy.

It means that farmers can have unencumbered assets of almost $740,000 before they are ineligible under the assets test. Notwithstanding the criticism that has been received of Austudy&mdash;and I am discharging the obligations I gave Senator Boswell in examining this issue; and I asked for the information that Senator Schacht has referred to for the 1994 academic year of rejections of applications for Austudy&mdash;one per cent of those applications were rejected.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans categorically denied that the increase in interest rates last week and the change in the prudential arrangements for home borrowing, which in future will require a minimum 20 per cent deposit for home buyers, will have any negative impact on the housing industry, on first home owners or indeed on interest rates generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, quite frankly, is an ample demonstration of the absolute incompetence of the Leader of the Government in any matters relating to economics. What he said about the effect of those changes is simply incorrect and he was also blatantly wrong in many of the facts that he sought to present. He said, for example, that interest rates in Australia today are at their lowest for 20 years. That is simply not true when the correct interest rate perspective&mdash;the real interest rate&mdash;is considered. Taking account of the inflation rate, real interest rates in Australia today are amongst the highest in the world&mdash;certainly higher than they have been on many occasions in the past 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that Senator Evans conveniently ignored was the point that Senator Hill so rightly made, that one must compare the impact of interest rates by looking at the rates of other countries as well. As Senator Hill pointed out, rates in Australia today, in nominal terms let alone real terms, are also amongst the highest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed to explain why the Reserve Bank took the decision last week to increase official interest rates by three-quarters of a per cent, knowing that that would flow right through the interest rate structure&mdash;and that is the reason why these decisions are taken. This is happening at a time when farmers are on their knees bleeding to death as a result of the worst drought on record in many parts of Australia and where there is no significant pick-up in the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one asks people in small business how things are going out there in the real world&mdash;a world the government knows nothing about&mdash;they will say that life out there is still very tough indeed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of all that, the government is now not only affecting the interest rate structure but also the prudential arrangements for home buyers, who in future will be required to pay a 20 per cent deposit. How on earth will most young couples seeking to buy a home for the first time get the 20 per cent deposit that is required? For many of them that puts home ownership further out of reach than ever it was in the past, and the interest rate factor is another double whammy on top of that. But the sheer availability of credit for first home buyers, for young couples, will be a killer in the first instance. </PARA>

What risks was he talking about? Was he talking about the possibility of the borrower losing his or her job? Was he talking about the possibility of a further collapse in asset prices? Or was he talking about, as I think he probably was, the risk of a further rapid rise in interest rates because of the continuing incompetence of this government's financial management which has allowed budget deficits to blow out excessively and enormously? That is the real underpinning reason for the unholy mess that we now have with monetary policy in Australia&mdash;a mess for which the government is not prepared to accept responsibility and about which it obviously will do nothing. </PARA>

It is absolutely fantastic that Australia is achieving growth because it is offering some hope to some people that life may be better this year than it was during the years of the recession that we had to have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine of 6 August 1994 stated that one of the reasons for this is that even with the highest rate of growth in 1994 in Australia and a prediction for continuing strong growth in 1995&mdash;even though those growth figures are good&mdash;our current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is getting worse. We are entering a strong phase of growth as are countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Japan and USA, which are all recording strong growth in the four to 4 1/2 per cent range, but let us look at Australia's performance on current account as a percentage of GDP. It is minus 3.7 per cent for this financial year and will actually increase next financial year. Other nations are managing their economies more prudently than ours. Canada, for example, is reducing its current account deficit as a proportion of GDP from 3.5 per cent to 2.9 per cent. Germany is reducing its current account deficit from 0.9 to 0.6. I repeat that Germany, with its massive economic problems&mdash;having taken in Eastern Germany and while trying to pick up the economy of that area&mdash;is still able to reduce its current account deficit as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>

In the United States where growth is around 4 per cent to 3.6 per cent over the next two years, even under the Clinton administration that country is able to reduce its current account deficit. So we are in this boom period where one would think the government would be able to get its deficit under control, but the massive growth of GDP, our current account deficit is increasing. People who under this government are paying mortgages and increased interest rates must wonder why the government is prepared to spend their money and take that freedom away from them.

The government at present has a very expansionary fiscal policy, with massive deficits, and at the same time it is attempting to haul the economy back, as it did in the `recession we had to have', by lifting interest rates. So the government is driving the economy with very high deficit expenditure, which is why private consumption is going up, as was referred to by Senator Kernot, and at the same time, to counter some of the inflationary effects emerging from this, it now has to raise interest rates. </PARA>

I am very pleased to note that my colleague Senator David Brownhill has proposed a matter of public importance to come before this chamber shortly this afternoon that will go into this very issue. I know that my colleagues on this side of the chamber will detail all of the areas where the government has totally failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not get an answer today to the question about how the Prime Minister totally misunderstands the issue. I mentioned in my supplementary question, in which I again put the barbs straight at Senator Evans, the whole issue of the comparisons that are invited&mdash;the assistance given to a very needy part of the community, those people and communities that are being affected by this severe drought, compared with Senator Evans's largess and comprehensive giving away of lucky dip funds in his portfolio of foreign affairs. I mentioned the Mekong bridge, which obviously Senator Collins then got wrong in his answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp has also pointed out to me a similar area, and that is the area of the out of court settlement of over $100 million of funds to settle a court matter at Nauru. That particular issue has been raised by Senator Kemp on a number of occasions. When we talk about spending $80 million or $100 million on a project like that, let us compare it with the petty cash items that Senator Collins got when he lined up at the cabinet table, was patted on the head and told that the marginal seat strategy of the Labor Party obviously did not accommodate these areas that are affected by drought. It is nothing like Mrs Kelly's throwing around of money in particular areas off a white board last year. It is nothing like the distribution of funds that go through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, where it wants to patch up problems. The drought is the most severe problem. This dreadfully harsh and severe drought is affecting the productive sector of Australia. It is affecting entire communities throughout Australia. It is affecting thousands and thousands of families who make up the backbone of this very country. </PARA>

Some writers might say that some ministers are obviously saying at the present time that there is a need for tax increases while other ministers are saying that there should be no tax increases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prime Minister Keating stands condemned for his callous disregard of the rural sector and for his chronic failure to recognise the devastating personal and financial heartbreak of this exceptional drought. It has long been accepted in rural areas of Australia that the Australian Labor Party does not understand and does not care about the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 20 years the Labor Party has berated, bashed and abused farmers through policy and invective. We all remember former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's taunt to farmers who were facing record bankruptcies and a dramatic turnaround in their terms of trade in the 1970s when he told them: `You never had it so good.' By comparison with the grim reaper we have in the Lodge today, he was probably right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating as Prime Minister is merely a more arrogant and more callous version of Paul Keating as Treasurer. Today much of Australia faces drought, not in the sense of the description that Prime Minister Keating suggests&mdash;`climate changes that are with us almost every year' or `that no longer simply fall into disaster category'&mdash;but drought in the sense of an exceptional drought, the worst drought on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales drought covers 60 per cent of the state, and without significant rain in the next two weeks this figure will be revised upwards to 80 per cent. The Darling River flow has stopped for the first time in a decade. In terms of lost production it has already cost the state billions of dollars, including $480 million from cotton, $600 million from wheat, $77 million from barley and about $45 million from canola. The loss is irreparable to the beef and sheep industries, with the slaughter of the female animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland the drought currently covers 35 per cent of the state, with another third about to be included. In some areas such as Dalby on the Darling Downs&mdash;which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) visited just recently, as did I&mdash;it is the fifth year of drought. Farmers there have eight consecutive crop losses behind them. They have no income, but mounting losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins said in question time today that the government had given $50 million in drought aid and assistance since 1992. To that I say, `Big deal.' Compared to my figures, it is only a little piddle. In both states crop plantings are down 80 per cent and many of the crops already sown are likely to fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is now the worst drought on record. They are not my words, but the advice of meteorological experts. This is not a typical El Nino; it is an abnormal series of El Ninos. Significantly, those same weather experts say that they could not predict it, that they did not predict it, and that they cannot predict when it will end, although they suggest that it may not break until next March. Prime Minister Keating suggests&mdash;unlike the weather experts&mdash;that farmers ought to be able to predict drought, that they ought to be able to plan for drought, and that they certainly ought to be able to manage through this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the basis and sentiment behind the national drought policy adopted in 1992&mdash;significantly at a time when much of Australia was already two years into drought. The national drought strategy objectives were: to encourage primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing for climatic variability; to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of extreme climate stress; and to ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries consistent with long-term sustainable levels. Under this policy farmers would assume greater responsibility for managing risk, and inherent in that were increased financial and business management skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's obligations under this policy, and I quote from the national drought policy document, were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to create the overall environment which is conducive to this property management planning and risk management approach. We will encourage producers to adopt improved property management practices through a system of incentives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I underline the word `incentives'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">information transfer, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of farmers throughout Australia, I must ask: where are the incentives? Where is this information transfer? Where is the support that was implicit in that agreement which was formulated only two and a bit years ago? It is this same former Treasurer, now Prime Minister Keating, who has systematically bled the rural sector and guaranteed that in all but the most opportune of seasons farmers cannot succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me list a few of the so-called incentives the minister's government has given to Australian farmers. It has increased primary industry charges that have seen government revenue from this sector go from $25 million to $110 million. It has increased the fuel excise. That has impacted doubly on the rural sector because not only are farmers paying higher prices for on-farm and off-farm fuel, but the cost of most of their inputs has also risen because of transport costs. Fuel excise collections are currently $8.5 billion, when in the early 1980s they were only $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wholesale sales tax collections are now $12 billion. They were $3 billion 10 years ago when the minister's government came to power. The government has removed the investment allowance from 1 July this year, when rural Australia was already struggling from years of the recession we did not have to have. It has removed the exceptional circumstances provision for wool growers because it was deemed by Mr Keating that they no longer needed it. The government has refused to honour an election promise to remove the assets test for farm families for Austudy. It has imposed and extended the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and de facto death duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has gutted the successful income equalisation scheme. Today there is only $137 million in the equalisation scheme, and it is so unattractive that people are not rushing into it even if they have the money. The government has removed the wool floor price scheme, when Prime Minister Keating and the then minister for primary industries, Mr Kerin, promised that it would stay. We have high interest rates artificially engineered by the then Treasurer Keating because he wanted to stabilise the economy. Those same interest rates saw farm borrowings increase by $5 billion in five years to $16 billion, and today the indebtedness of the rural sector stands at $17.3 billion. Those interest rates moved rural loans from an average of 10 per cent to something like 24 per cent. The government has removed 8.3 per cent of farmers from their properties and, from the way it is going now, it wants to remove the rest of them because it does not care a damn about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those interest rates and all those inappropriate anti-rural policies are now impacting on the sector that is facing historic drought whilst it is being told that it is a mere climatic variability. The minister has been out there and has seen it. I hope he can knock some sense into the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to farmers across Australia, as has the minister, and the message I receive is the same: all that farmers want is a fair go. The minister has met them; I have met them. All that farmers want is a fair go. They want to be self-reliant but, when it gets beyond the ability of the individual to cope because of exceptional circumstances such as this drought, then it is time for the government to intervene and to play its part to a much greater extent than it thinks it is doing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But farmers could not do it when the starting point for this new self-reliant approach came at a time when many had already spent two years in an exceptional drought. Most were still reeling from the impact of 20 per cent interest rates, a collapse of the entire wool industry, and removal of tax incentives and investment incentives such as IEDs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one farmer told me only last week, `If you can't put food on the table, if you can't educate your kids as well as city people, surely then it is time for the government to take notice.' It is callous, it is cruel, that any Prime Minister ignore this plea. Mr Keating has ignored it and continues to ignore it. If he cared for rural Australia, why increase diesel fuel prices and propose an administration charge on farmers for lodging their rebate claims&mdash;a charge that would have generated far more income than the rebate scheme actually costs to administer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why encourage the Reserve Bank to push interest rates up another 0.75 per cent&mdash;a move that will cost the rural sector an additional $120 million? Why talk up the Australian dollar when every cent upwards costs the rural sector $160 million? And why wait until farmers are on their knees and begging before throwing them the equivalent of crumbs? The damage is chronic and massive; the assistance provided is begrudging and paltry. The New South Wales farmers called it `Canberra's conscience money'. It is once again too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister in the other place, Mr Anderson, suggested, it is vital that such schemes as fodder schemes be reintroduced because those farmers that do survive this drought will need to keep the nucleus of their herds and flocks intact to allow them to breed their way out of financial difficulties and help Australia's balance of payments. At the moment female cattle and sheep are having their heads knocked off. But we need more. We need long-term strategies that provide genuine incentives for farmers through the tax system. The government must examine assistance in terms of debt set aside, interest relief and genuine incentives for self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Mr Keating to claim that exceptional circumstances funding is available, but the reality is that 47 per cent of farmers were rejected for that assistance. This government has been inadequate and uncaring in its help. This Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in particular stands condemned for his callous attitude in handling the whole of this drought issue. It is up to the minister to knock some sense into him. I hope he can, because the Australian people will make sure the Prime Minister stands condemned for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Colston)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Before I call Senator Collins, I understand that agreement has been reached on the time allocated for speakers in this debate: Senator Brownhill 10 minutes; Senator Collins 20 minutes; Senator Woodley five minutes; Senator MacGibbon seven minutes; Senator Burns five minutes; Senator Crane eight minutes; and Senator Margetts five minutes.

He normally approaches these matters in a little more substantive fashion, as he did when he was deputy chair of the Senate committee that actually investigated the drought situation. I am disappointed that today Senator Brownhill has taken precisely the partisan position on this, condemning the Labor Party for its `rejection' of the bush&mdash;the natural constituency of the National Party. The very thing that industry leaders are asking the National Party not to do, he has done today on our first day back in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is as though one were sitting in here yesterday and the day before. Nothing ever changes from the other side.' Following that cabinet discussion, which would never have occurred without a formal submission, without the personal endorsement of the Prime Minister to get it in there under the line, the President of the Grains Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Collins gave us an undertaking that he would go to Cabinet with a request for further funding particularly in the area of exceptional circumstances. In fact he achieved more than we expected by not only getting exceptional circumstances, he added to that, money for drought employee support scheme. . .</PARA>
<PARA>There was not even a mention from Senator Brownhill this afternoon of that extremely valuable scheme that operates in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got $5 million worth of additional support for that scheme, more than doubling the original commitment to it, that actually subsidises with federal government funds the employment of on-farm labour.

That was acknowledged by the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude on the public comments that have been made, I direct the Senate's attention once again to the terms of this motion. It is not a motion concerning the drought, it is not a motion that is suggesting what the government should do about it, it is just a piece of grubby, political point scoring saying that the Prime Minister, because of statements that he made in Queensland, has ignored the drought and has given no assistance to those suffering from it. In just that little snapshot addressing the terms of Senator Brownhill's MPI&mdash;and there are plenty more, as I am sure he will know&mdash;there has been significant acknowledgment from respected industry leaders across Australia of the Prime Minister's support for further drought assistance. Just yesterday&mdash;22 August&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on page 2 had the headline, `Drought aid wins priority with PM.'</PARA>

I have made myself available, and continue to do so, to hear positive suggestions about how that delivery can be improved. But all that we have heard from Senator Brownhill this afternoon is partisan attacks on the Prime Minister that have been rebutted publicly by industry leaders across the board in Australia in their acknowledgment of the Prime Minister's understanding of the situation and the commitments that he has publicly given to provide assistance, which we have very quickly done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the myriad of transcripts of media interviews with those leaders to conclude that they all acknowledge that the Prime Minister firmly understands the gravity of the drought as it affects Queensland and New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the party political point scoring Senator Brownhill engaged in by his attacks on the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister saying in Queensland that drought was a normal part of the Australian landscape, I would remind Senator Brownhill again of the principal conclusion reached by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs of which he was the deputy chair. I have to acknowledge, particularly in view of the presence in the chamber of the shadow minister for rural Australia from the Democrats&mdash;I promise the Leader of the Democrats that I will not make this mistake again, and I will not use the expression `bipartisan support' again&mdash;the cross party support which was received because the Democrats were part of this committee. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read it in total. In respect of what the Prime Minister said in Queensland, Senator Brownhill should listen to what he as part of this committee said about it. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that drought should not be reinstated within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That was the context of the question that the Prime Minister was answering. Senator Brownhill should look at the full transcript, not just the edited bits of it that were run. The Prime Minister was asked if he would support the calls made then by the Premier of New South Wales for the removal of drought from RAS, which was the fundamental recommendation of this Senate committee of which Senator Brownhill was the deputy chair, and whether he would support its return to the natural disasters relief arrangements. That was the reply that he gave. It is almost word for word the same, interestingly enough, as the conclusions drawn by Senator Brownhill's committee that he endorsed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that drought should not be reinstated within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements as this would compromise the development of a self-reliant, risk management approach to drought. The Committee's conclusion on this matter also recognises that drought is a recurring feature of Australia's climate that must be prepared for and managed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the Prime Minister said when he was in Queensland. The Prime Minister has also acknowledged, as have industry leaders publicly acknowledged, that the drought in Queensland has gone beyond a normal drought in Australia in that, as was pointed out earlier by Senator Brownhill, places in Australia like the Darling Downs, which for years have been seen as some of the premier farming areas of Australia, have now suffered four continuous years of drought and in some cases seven or eight successive crop failures. The situation in Queensland has gone, and unfortunately is continuing to go, beyond any form of drought that any farmer, no matter how professional, could properly manage for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill has totally ignored the mass of evidence available&mdash;not even acknowledged it. The Prime Minister has not only acknowledged it, but he has publicly pledged his support and supported my submission to cabinet at the first cabinet meeting&mdash;otherwise it would have never have got in the room&mdash;and provided $14 million worth of immediate additional drought assistance. As I said, that carries the total amount of specific drought assistance&mdash;that is, in addition to normal RAS&mdash;to in excess of $50 million since 1992, to which Senator Brownhill's total response was, `So what!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have contributed nothing to this debate this afternoon. I guess I will have to wait for other coalition members to try to make up the deficiencies in what we have just heard, apart from a personal attack on the Prime Minister for making a statement in Queensland which was totally consistent with the principal recommendation of the Senate committee chaired by Senator Brownhill. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I have referred to it once today but I will do so again&mdash;Senator Brownhill himself said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I said that it did not really matter whether drought fell within the natural disaster relief arrangements or not, as long as the Commonwealth Government realised that it had to give some assistance once the economic capabilities of individuals and the State were unable to cope with a drought.</PARA>
<PARA>The new RAS arrangements resulted from, among other things, the recommendations of this committee. The recommendations of this committee were acted on by the government, and that is where RAS 1992 came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RAS 1992 put a new focus on education, training and government assistance that is available for planning and managing for drought. The evidence is there&mdash;and I am happy to provide it to anybody who wants it&mdash;that farmers are accessing that assistance. In fact, I have had this portfolio for only a very short time, but within the first month of taking it on I received representations in meetings from peak farming groups acknowledging the huge benefit they were getting from the counsel&mdash;the professional financial advice&mdash;that is available to them free of charge through the RAS scheme. I received suggestions, which I have acted on, that it could be coordinated better and delivered more effectively if it was provided on a regional basis rather than on an individual farm to farm basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the government's response has been quick&mdash;industry leaders have acknowledged that the government has acted very quickly and properly in the matter. I am available, as all of those peak bodies know, for further discussions on this issue&mdash;and there will be further discussions&mdash;as to ways of improving the delivery of assistance that is being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the obvious point that there is a great deal of concern about this continuing drought. We all pray for rain. As I understand it, a formal process of prayer has been organised somewhere this week by the churches and, knowing Senator Woodley's antecedents, I would appreciate some advice on that if he has it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I do not have the details, but I will get them for Senator Collins because I certainly would be interested in engaging in any activity which would end this drought. I rise to speak to this matter of public interest, but I am disappointed that Senator Brownhill has sought to make political capital out of the tragic and terrible situation of Australian farmers. We are in the midst of an exceptional drought. No-one, I am sure, would argue about the devastating personal and financial heartbreak which many Australian farmers face. I agree with that part of the motion and it is this heartbreak that I want to address today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not believe there is a lot of point in my joining in a debate about the rest of Senator Brownhill's motion, as it is little more than silly political point scoring. Whether the callous disregard of the rural sector by Mr Keating and his related failure is worth debating is a matter of opinion, but I am not sure that any of us can claim to have done enough for the bush or our country people. I certainly am not going to stand up here today as though I am lilywhite in that regard. I am not going to single out anyone for particular blame. However, I want to underline and emphasise that I recognise we are in the midst of a terrible drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to emphasise that there is an even deeper problem beyond and prior to the drought, and that is the extent of rural debt. I want to quote from the submission to the rural and regional affairs committee by the Australian conference of leaders of religious institutes. Only last week, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought is only part of the story. Banks have a lot to answer for. And, to my knowledge, top level executives of the Commonwealth Bank, in particular, who repeatedly refused to negotiate with families in financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>I could add to that many stories. I received in my office just today two votergrams. One was from Mrs Elaine Toohey of Hinkler Street, Tullamore, New South Wales. She exclaims:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I very much need whatever assistance &amp; advice you can offer . . .</PARA>
<PARA>as she recounts the story of what has happened to her with her debt. I received another votergram from Don Knight of Riverview, Mount David, New South Wales which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PLEA FOR HELP . . . BEFORE DEBT DESTROYS US</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you help in any way?</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that not only are we in the midst of a dreadful drought but also the debt which farmers face has made that drought far worse. The submission of the Australian Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes to the rural and regional committee further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deregulation of the banking system in the early 1980s gradually cast aside the long-standing relationship and introduced several significant changes.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further on it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in this sea change, the financial institutions now operated according to the practices and parameters set by other commercial institutions in which the onus is on the clients to protect their own interests.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission was commenting on the fact that years ago farmers could depend upon managers of rural banks, but that has all changed. The submission goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the wake of this change, few farmers appeared to be aware of the manner in which the new practices would affect them. In the rural recession of the mid 1980s however, farmers quickly learned that loyalty and trust were dispensable, and were therefore dispensed with.</PARA>

These industries provide one-quarter of Australia's export earnings, even in times of reduced output, and over half a million Australians are employed in the food industry, either in producing food or processing it for the Australian community and export. We are in the grip of one of the worst droughts in living memory in Queensland and New South Wales. I declare an interest here as a grazier who has been involved in this drought in Queensland for 3 1/2 years as a beef producer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look at the forecasts from the weather bureau and I find there is no chance of significant rain before April 1995. If that is correct, it means that in my state of Queensland we will not get rain until the wet season in January-February-March 1996. So we are looking at a four- or five-year drought. That is a huge imposition on the industry. It is being put on an industry that has been weakened by very low profits in the last 10 to 15 years. The sugar industry and the beef industry have had very low commodity prices and difficult climatic conditions. There is no fat in the system. Money has not gone into improving properties the way that it might have done in previous times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens when rain comes? If the drought breaks grain producers should get a cash flow back between four to six months after they get a crop off. But it is not like that for cattle producers or sheep producers. They are looking at a very much longer time before they can get a cash flow re-established. It might be that they are looking at a period of at least three years before that cash flow is re-established. So there could be something like eight years of either negative incomes or at best breaking even for an industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not too many blocks of eight years in a human working life. It is not as though producers would have those bad times for eight years only out of an effective working life of 35 or 40 years. They have to reckon on the fact that they will probably have one drought of 12 months or so duration every three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem for the rural industry at the present time in Australia is that the boom periods do not compensate for the bad years. We do not seem to get the periods like we enjoyed, admittedly on rare occasions in our history, where we would get one or two good seasons and be able to cover the loss of some years preceding that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things are genuinely very tough out there. The concern on this side of the chamber is for the total lack of concern demonstrated by the government to the needs of the rural community. We have a Prime Minister who, when he goes to Queensland, says `Oh well, you've got to expect bad times. That's your lot. Just put up with it and don't complain.' If those bad times were suffered by urban Australians, the human misery would be met by welfare and support programs, and quite properly so. But our rural communities are tied up under rules which prevent them from getting the entitlements that so many of their cousins in the city areas get. If the rural industries themselves existed in a visible and vital role in the urban area, there would be something done for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has not even visited the drought areas of Queensland. He has been to Port Douglas on his numerous holidays. He is reported today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> to have been at Sanctuary Cove looking at yachts to buy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You had better stick to Sydney and make merry with the push,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the bush will never suit you and you will never suit the bush.</PARA>
<PARA>Admittedly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has been up there, but it took him 3 1/2 years to get there despite the fact that many of us on this side, myself included, drew attention to the needs of rural Australia because of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that the government has done is support the rural adjustment scheme. Whatever hopes we might have had in 1992 about the rural adjustment scheme, it has proved to be a failure. It just does not work. The `exceptional circumstances' case has far too stringent a set of criteria to support the rural community. For the lesser dry periods, the IED scheme is a farce. When we were in government, something like $2 billion was involved in deposits under the IED scheme. Today the amount is estimated to be $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to do something about that. The minister was saying he wanted to know what to do. I will tell him what to do. First of all, he has to recognise that there is a big difference between having a dry season for 12 or 24 months, which, if we support producers with realistic taxation policies and provide them with the ability to cope with those, they will get through them and the major droughts, such as the four-, five- or six-year situation we are involved in now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the shorter term cases, it is clear that we need to provide financial incentives so that people can store fodder and water. As a rural producer, I find it anomalous that I can get a 27 per cent depreciation allowance on my personal computer but a dam, which is vital for me, attracts a seven per cent depreciation rate. It is absolute nonsense. In the particular case of one dam I am thinking of, it has had to be rebuilt twice in the last five or so years. There ought to be realistic depreciation rates so that improvements can go into properties when times are good. That of course makes the assumption that times are good and that the profits are there to go into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terrible impediment we have of the fringe benefits tax makes it very difficult for us to employ people on properties. That tax is ideologically driven. There is no need for a fringe benefits tax in the way it is written and applied at the present time to rural employers. Let us have a fair fringe benefits tax, something that is simple and cheap to administer. Why do we have to pay excise duty for road maintenance on trains hauling freight out to rural properties? It is absolute nonsense. The money raised from that excise does not go to the railway lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us do some commonsense things. I think we have to look at the national disaster relief organisation again because the rural adjustment scheme in the extreme circumstances simply is not working.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not very impressed by Senator Brownhill's contribution on this occasion as he spent much of his time describing the problems associated with what is a severe drought. I do not have any argument with that. I probably will not have any argument with the description of the drought and its consequences that Senator Crane might talk about. He also works very well in the committee across party lines in focussing on the problems and seeking the solutions. The point has already been made today that we brought down a unanimous report in the area of drought, and that has been well documented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is easy to confuse drought with a severe drought. Drought is part of the Australian landscape. Drought is the absence of rain, aridity&mdash;other descriptions can be given to it. It may be for a period of two years. When we talk about the affected areas, we talk about people being able to manage for drought. All of the organisations that represent the farming community rightly talk about the need to manage and prepare for drought. When Prime Minister Keating talked about drought being part of the landscape, he was referring to that sort of situation. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister understands and as part of the cabinet made the decision that, when there is a severe drought, it is very necessary to put extraordinary measures into place to assist people. I talk of droughts that may be only once in 50 or 100 years. There is, I repeat, no question about the fact that people are hurting out there in rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the drought report we made certain suggestions that follow the thinking of many other people in the community such as those involved in an expert drought task force that looked at the matter before our committee did. We talked about self-sufficiency and the ways of accomplishing that, such as using methods of taxation. One of the things that has to be quickly recognised is that, if people have not been practising good management and planning on a farm because they have not had those skills, they could well be in a position where they have not prepared for a drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe anybody should say, `Look, they've stuffed it up, so let them go down.' I do not believe that at all. In those circumstances the government should dig deep, as it would on occasions when there are floods or fires and people have to be helped. While we can talk about managing and preparing for drought, there are those circumstances that are not in that category and people must be sympathetic and must help.

Others are very wasteful of their talents and wasteful in their work. They are bad managers, have problems and want the government to solve those problems at all times. That is not possible.

What came out of that was the fact that Australia kept in place 100 years of breeding of its merino sheep flock. It kept its cattle stock in place; it kept its machinery and a whole host of things. This government has had 11 years to put a strategy in place to handle drought. All the government has done is talk about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the report of the Standing Committee and at why I waved it around in question time today. We are getting the same evidence all over again. I particularly want to make reference to the so-called crocodile tears. People who gave us evidence in 1992&mdash;people who are still in a drought&mdash;broke down and cried, as the chairman of the committee which prepared this report knows. The chairman nurtured them through that. It was very heart rending. Senator Burns will remember that. Yet the Prime Minister says that crying crocodile tears about drought affected areas is not going to help people. The fact is that these people are emotionally and financially bankrupt. To now throw $14 million on the table shows that the government has very lately found compassion in terms of dealing with the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructuring of RAS in 1992&mdash;and the evidence keeps on flowing through to us&mdash;has been a failure. In terms of the exceptional circumstances of the wool industry, it has equally been a failure. To have discontinued the scheme last June when the vast majority of people in the wool industry&mdash;forgetting about the criteria&mdash;had not had the opportunity to get the improved wool prices demonstrates once again the callous thinking behind this government and its response. The people in the wool industry are now at about break-even point. The decision was a very poor and very sad decision that was made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the figures we see that the percentage of people who applied, people who had been traditional and successful wool growers over a long time, and who could get that assistance was very small. The government wants to look very carefully and seriously at the way it has treated our great industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the rural adjustment recommendations of 1992 a lot of the issues have not been addressed by the government. We are hearing about the IEDs over and again&mdash;and we will deal with them when the new report comes out. In this current look at the rural adjustment scheme we are getting a re-run of what we got in 1992. That shows that, once again, in terms of long-term planning and dealing with a particular problem, the government has not responded. The fact is that the IED scheme, as it is right now, is a disincentive for people to protect themselves from various ravages. The great tragedy of the IED scheme is that it was withdrawn from 1985 to 1988 when wool prices reached very high levels. It was those people sitting on the other side of the chamber who removed that&mdash;no-one else. They took the IEDs away at a time when there were high incomes and when people could have put something away. The same applies with tax incentives, whether for fodder, water or conservation fencing. Those opposite took those incentives away. No-one else did it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good pointing the finger at people on this side of the chamber and saying, `What would be your response?' We have said many times in this place, both in committees and as individuals, what the response should be; those opposite have not addressed the issues that should be addressed. They should hang their heads in shame. They can talk until they are blue in the face about self-reliance, but if they put in place a policy which stops people from moving to a self-reliant position, they have to wear it. They have to wear the fact that they kept interest rates jacked up for so long and just recently have put interest rates up again, which will cost the rural industry $120 million and the rest of the community a lot more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite look at their policy responses to these things they will see that the responses have been totally inadequate.

It is a real problem. What those opposite have to do is address the processes. There should not be the type of inquisitive inquiry into the personal side of people's lives, when dealing with the assets test for Austudy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Zakharov</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to advise you of developments associated with the Regulations under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991</EMPHASIS> (the ESOS Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will recall that the Regulations relating to the operation of notified trust accounts into which providers are required to deposit all pre-paid course money received from international students, and the requirement for providers to be members of a tuition assurance scheme (TAS), were subject to a notice of motion of disallowance. These Regulations then were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training (SSCEET) for inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 June 1994, following the SSCEET hearing, I advised you of proposed amendments to the ESOS legislation. These amendments were to address industry concerns about agents' commissions and enrolment fees in return for retaining the TAS provisions in a modified form to meet the Government's concerns for a safety net to protect the interests of international students. In its report of June 1994 on "The nature, implications and effects of the Statutory Rules 1994 Nos. 146 and 154", the Senate Committee indicated that it accepted my proposals as forming a sound basis for resolving its concerns and postponed the debate on the disallowance of the Regulations to the 1994 Spring sittings of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have since amended the Statutory Rules 1994 No. 154 to give effect to my proposals regarding the TAS requirements. In particular, under Regulations 11 and 13, a TAS must be operated by an association of providers which has, as one of its objects, the operation of a TAS to ensure that overseas students receive the education and training for which they paid. This is in keeping with my commitment that a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">bona fide</EMPHASIS> industry association that has, as part of its membership criteria, a commitment to a student placement scheme, may be approved as a TAS. The amended TAS Regulations (copy attached) commence on 24 August and providers have until 30 November 1994 to join a TAS or be exempted from the requirement to join a TAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individual providers may seek exemption from membership of a voluntary association because of the special nature of the courses that they offer, or because it is unreasonable in the circumstances to expect them to be members of a TAS, or they do not wish to become a member of a TAS. In these circumstances, providers seeking exemption from the TAS requirement, must have appropriate insurance or bank guarantees, or a guarantee from a parent company or organisation, which cover the risk to students' pre-paid fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the trust account Regulations, I have proposed that providers will be exempt from depositing 20 per cent of the pre-paid tuition fees into trust accounts. This recognises the common industry practice of off-shore agents deducting their commission before forwarding the balance of the student's course fees to the provider in Australia. Providers will also be exempt from depositing into their trust accounts an enrolment fee of no more than $250.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of advice from the Attorney-General's (AG's) Department that implementation of the amendments to the trust account Regulations requires an amendment to the ESOS Act, I have sought the Prime Minister's approval to amend the ESOS Act in the Spring sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had intended that, following the amendment to the ESOS Act, amendments to the trust account Regulations would come into operation with retrospective effect from 1 June 1994. However, AG's Department has since advised that while it would be possible to amend the ESOS Act with retrospective effect, it would not be advisable to amend the trust account Regulations with retrospective effect. This is because the proposed Regulations would exempt providers from depositing the entire 100 per cent of the pre-paid tuition fees into the trust account. In some circumstances, this would reduce the amount of pre-paid tuition fees that students are entitled to receive in the event of default by the provider, and it could disadvantage the students who are the principal clients of the ESOS legislation. A copy of AG's advice on this matter is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of providers having to comply with trust account provisions that differ over a short period, the Department will ensure that administrative procedures are in place to minimise the potential difficulties faced by providers having to comply with more stringent trust account requirements between 1 June 1994 and the amendment to the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the ESOS Act, therefore, will commence on the date of Royal Assent. When the amendment to the Act is passed, appropriate amendments to the Regulations will be made to exempt providers from depositing 20 per cent of pre-paid tuition fees, and an enrolment fee of no more than $250, into their trust accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department will be writing to industry representatives shortly advising them of the above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. However, I still strongly suggest that when the minister brings in the bill to amend the act to enable the regulations to be made he at that time table those proposed regulations so that we know what we are dealing with. There is a constant feeling among those who have been involved with this matter that we have spent a lot of time shooting in the dark. To try to remove some of that uncertainty, I have been asking a considerable number of questions on notice about the government's promotion of the export overseas of education services. I have done that in response to requests from people involved in the enterprise of education exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without any fixed expectations of a particular outcome to those questions, I have been amazed at the results of the inquiries that I have made. I have found that the reputation of DEET and DEET officers could not be lower in this industry. With respect to the content of these particular regulations and the negotiations between DEET and the industry representatives, it ought to be of concern to the minister that the industry itself had no confidence in the integrity of the process of negotiations; nor any confidence in the department to abide by any negotiated position. That is why consideration of these notices of motion was postponed&mdash;to allow a resolution of those problems that have been identified by the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, for the first time in years, this industry has reported to me that it is satisfied with the outcome. My inquiries so far, and the information given to me by industry representatives, clearly show that there is no need for this legislation, and there never has been. We have built an edifice of legislation and regulation to provide a controlling mechanism for a situation that is unlikely to recur, and did not need to occur in the first place. A totally unnecessary burden has been imposed on education colleges, which are really small businesses, and that burden was to have been made more onerous by the original regulations which, thankfully, have now been modified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants in this burgeoning industry include flying schools, Bible colleges, schools of hospitality, business colleges and English colleges&mdash;all of which have been caught up in the fallout from the government's involvement in rapid expansion of the export of education, particularly during the late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More particularly, the sudden cessation of student visas of those from Beijing by the government resulted in massive hardship for thousands of students and, eventually, for Australian private colleges. One result of that fiasco was the ESOS Act and the minefield of subsequent regulations, created ostensibly to maintain Australia's overseas reputation as a reliable provider of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another result was the creation of CRICOS, the register of institutions permitted to accept overseas students and the transfer of the responsibility for approving institutions to provide courses to the states in 1990. This has had the effect of removing the mechanism which should remain in place instead of the nightmare of regulations under the ESOS Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer from the minister that he has a committee to review the national code of conduct and the minimum standards for approval of institutions and courses is small comfort. Perhaps part of that review might be how best to monitor institutions so that we can dispense with the ESOS Act entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the best protection the government could give students would be a real assurance scheme, a scheme which assured students and colleges that government departments would not cause unilateral contradictions of government policy and direction. With such a real assurance scheme there would be no need for any of this flummery we have before us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Like Senator Bell and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, I have a sense of deja vu about this whole issue. Three years ago the three of us were in the position of considering the draconian legislation of the government to regulate the ESOS industry, which was then a fledgling $800 million export industry. The effects of our actions at that time to undo that draconian legislation and set up a more deregulatory framework for this industry actually helped it to prosper and grow from an industry of $800 million to an industry of $1,500 million today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore surprising that through 1992 and 1993, in response to very limited problems in the industry, the government did return to trying to adopt draconian legislation. I support the comments of Senator Bell in that the government went in with a very heavy-handed approach and again tried to institute measures that were confusing to the industry and, indeed, damaging to its future growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that legislation is needed to protect particularly the fees of students and that some regulations are needed for this particular industry. But the history of it has meant that the government has tried to take away independence and this has affected international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations the government proposed on this occasion, ones which we have been considering over the last eight months, were incompetently drafted and were dangerous in terms of the future of the industry. It is only because the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training scrutinised this piece of legislation and the associated regulations that the government did start to back down and the department did start to listen to our concerns. It was only after we had undertaken a series of hearings, at which we listened to the industry and to the students, that we did start to get some sense into the regulatory framework for this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last three or four months we have had a series of backdowns by the department. It was not until we actually brought the major players in the field&mdash;the ELICOS Association, the ACPET group for private business colleges, the students, and indeed the officials of DEET&mdash;together around the table and able to listen to each other that we finally got the government to listen to what we had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to Senator Bell for moving for the disallowance of these provisions, which actually brought us to this position. It was only through the sorts of measures he proposed that the government was actually forced to the table and forced to listen to what students and industry had to say on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken today to a number of players in the industry and they are pretty happy with what the Senate has done on this matter. The regulations allow the industry to not have the burdens placed upon them that were contained in the tuition assurance proposal of the government. We have a system that is more flexible and open. We have a system that is far less onerous than what was originally proposed. It is one that will not put a cost burden or, indeed, an export disadvantage on the industry, which is what the original legislation and regulations would have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this is a great outcome for the industry and a great victory for the Senate, I flag some remaining concerns about the legislative and regulatory framework for this industry. What we have set up in this act is in many ways, I think, quite a dangerous precedent. It is instructive that we needed only two minor changes to the principal act and an enormous number of changes to the regulations to bring this about. In other words, by the way the government has now set up the act, the whole direction and driving force of the act is with the regulations and not with the principal act. Therefore, if at some time in the future the government wants to change the arrangements it can do so by regulation, not by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all honourable senators know, legislation providing that things be done comes before this chamber and has the full scrutiny of the Senate. Although we have a regulations and ordinances committee, such matters do not receive quite the scrutiny as matters do in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I leave this debate with the warning that there needs to be an ongoing watch on DEET and on the implementation of this act through regulations so that its attempts&mdash;there have been two in the last three years which have failed&mdash;to bring in draconian controls on this industry are not repeated in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will not detain the Senate long; however, I want to reiterate that this matter really places on record a significant indictment of the government's methods of operation and evidences the value of the Senate committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said very ably by Senator Tierney&mdash;unfortunately I missed most of Senator Bell's contribution, but what I heard was consistent with that said by Senator Tierney&mdash;the government did not behave in this matter in a legislatively responsible way and the Senate had first to impose a discipline on it at the time of passing the 1993 legislation. That was a discipline requiring the regulations to be put down within a time frame, which was by 30 June of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the government introduced those regulations only a very short time before the expiry of that time frame. No doubt this was to give the Senate as little time as possible for their consideration. I think the government ought to be criticised for that. Secondly, the government clearly had failed in the normal process of consultation with industry. It was evident from any superficial perusal of the regulations that the sensible industry advice in this matter simply had been disregarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate then moved to a second step of discipline and that was the motion of disallowance moved by Senator Bell, combined with the motion that we moved to refer the issue to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. By means of that mechanism we were, therefore, able to hold the matter and put it to, in effect, public scrutiny. Once the effect of the notice given by Senator Bell was a holding operation, the effect of sending it to the Senate committee enabled a public examination of the concerns of industry and the views of students in particular and enabled an examination of the departmental officers as well. This is the real value of the Senate committee system. It gives the opportunity for the community and interest groups that are most affected by the government's legislative program to actually become part of that legislative program, to participate and put forward their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that one day hearing&mdash;albeit somewhat rushed, as I understand it&mdash;it became obvious to all that the government's regulations were unsatisfactory. It was so obvious, in fact, that the government agreed to go away and further negotiate with industry. In other words, the government, in effect, acknowledged its own failing. But if we had not had the process of being able to hold the regulations and refer it for public examination to the Senate committee, an unsatisfactory set of regulations would have become law in this country. As a result of the government recognising its shortcomings and entering into further negotiations we now have an outcome which, as we heard from Senator Tierney, is reasonably satisfactory to the industry and to all who have an interest in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the government has learnt from this experience but, as Senator Tierney indicated, there is sadly some suggestion that it has not and that we will go through the process of further regulations&mdash;and perhaps this whole process again, if the government has not learnt&mdash;rather than the government putting substantial changes of this nature through the parliament as bills that are capable of being subjected to proper parliamentary scrutiny within this chamber and the normal processes of amendment. We would certainly take the opportunity to advise the government of that as a preferred course of action to avoid the sort of embarrassment that it has suffered in this matter. Nevertheless, I think the bottom line is that, although the government has not stood well in this process, the result is certainly a significant credit to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>The Committee considers that several</PARA>

<PARA>Given its acceptance of evidence from the</PARA>

<PARA>New Zealand shearers are residents of</PARA>
<PARA>Australia and, as a consequence, rejects</PARA>
<PARA>the assertion that they are "fly-by-</PARA>

<PARA>shearers in Australia is more complex</PARA>

<PARA>view that New Zealand shearers who are</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE ORGANISATION AND FUNDING OF RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 May 1993 the Senate referred the above inquiry to the Senate Standing Committee for their action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry's terms of reference focused on changes in the pattern of research activity across the higher education sector, research infrastructure, concentration of university research effort,  the maintenance of plurality in research operations and the adequacy of existing initiatives for the establishment of links between higher education institutions and industry. The Committee also explored the issues of balance between different types of research and the allocation of research funding and infrastructure support to each type of research, practices and processes employed by the Australian Research Council (ARC) in research funding, and the relationship of the ARC to government and higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received over 170 submissions. Issues most commonly raised were insufficient funding for research infrastructure, the number of high quality research proposals unable to be funded by the ARC, and the nature of Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) support for the administration of the Large Grants program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the issues raised are already under consideration by the Government. In particular a number of recommendations concerned matters of detail in connection with the ARC Large Grants program. These and broader issues such as program administration structure and resourcing of the ARC selection processes were considered by a tripartite consultative committee involving DEET, ARC and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET). Changes arising from the first stage of this review process are being implemented and a Joint Consultative Group has been established to discuss further proposed changes and support arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that, for the purpose of allocation of Australian Postgraduate Awards (APAs) to institutions, the Australian Research Council (ARC) develop an explicit statement setting out the detailed criteria against which "a quality research environment" should be assessed.  (Page 18) 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1993 Higher Education Budget Statement, announcing the new APA scheme, indicated that APAs would be allocated to institutions according to a formula taking into account the quality of each institution's postgraduate education environment. The NBEET Report, Postgraduate Support and Student Mobility, tabled in 1993, included in its recommendations the retention of a formula-driven block allocation of awards giving consideration to the quality of the research environment, higher degree research load and higher degree research completions. DEET is currently considering possible allocation formulas taking into account advice received from the ARC, the Higher Education Council (HEC) and peak bodies such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that Mechanism B infrastructure funding be retained for the triennium 1994-96, and then be reviewed. (Page 43)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mechanism B funds were provided for five years to assist former colleges of advanced education and institutes of technology to develop their research infrastructure. Given this period of five years of special funding plus the fact that all institutions now receive funding for student places at the same level (allowing for discipline mix and level), it is reasonable that the former advanced education institutions compete for infrastructure funding on the same terms as all other institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition many former advanced education institutions have merged with pre-1987 universities and in these cases it has become difficult to separate the advanced education element from the former university element.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As previously announced by the Government, Research Infrastructure Block Grants for 1995 will include funding for the former Mechanisms A and B and be allocated on the basis of research performance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends a review of the grants eligible for inclusion in the national competitive grants index (the Composite Research Index) to overcome existing anomalies and omissions and to reflect more fairly the breadth and diversity of Australia's research effort. (Page 47)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composite research index, to be used to reallocate the research quantum within operating grants, has been reviewed by a high level working party under the aegis of the AVCC. Membership of the Working Party included representatives of the AVCC, DEET, ARC and HEC. The Working Party has recommended the composite index include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">nationally competitive research grants, including Co-operative Research Centres (CRCs);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">other public funding, including State and local government funding; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">industry and other funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Working Party has recommended the inclusion of research outputs, initially research publications and higher degree research completions, but with relatively small weights in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Party recommendations are currently being considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that any ARC competitively-funded research project, as well as all CRC grants, identify an appropriate proportion of project funds to be allocated specifically for library support. (Page 54)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for institutions to build up their research infrastructure, including libraries, is available through research infrastructure funds and through operating grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRCs negotiate agreements voluntarily in terms of known variables including the resourcing of libraries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allocating a proportion of research project and other funds to library support is a matter for institutions to decide in relation to overall priorities and competing needs. It should be examined at a broader level than at the level of an individual research grant. The efficient development and use of library resources should recognise that teaching/learning and research functions are served in common by library infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Government provide an establishment fund of $10m over a three year period administered by the AVCC Standing Committee on Information Resources to help set in place the appropriate structures for a distributed national library collection within the Unified National System, with links into the broader national library system. (Page 60)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the development of structures to support a distributed national library system collection within the Unified National System (UNS) and with links to the broader national library system. Such an important development would necessarily involve widespread consultation with all relevant bodies and take into account the advice of the AVCC. It is not possible at this stage to be prescriptive as to the nature, size and administration of any such program. Any additional funding for library resources within the UNS will be judged by the Government as part of its overall approach to the framing of future Budgets. However within existing levels of funding for higher education, the Government has earmarked $5m from the National Priority (Reserve) Fund over the period 1994 to 1996 for system-wide library infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Government consider favourably requests for financial assistance for the upgrading and extension of AARNet and for associated training of researchers in its use. (Page 63)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined in the context of the ASTEC study on research data networks</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acting on ARC advice the Government has allocated a total of $4.2m to AARNet over the five year period 1990 to 1994 largely directed to equipment and training costs on the basis of formal applications under the Research Infrastructure program. For example, $1.0m was provided in 1992 for training and equipment, $0.5m in 1993 and $0.7m in 1994 for the upgrading of equipment. In addition, a sum of $3.4 million over five years, commencing in 1994, is being made available as part of the Research Data Networks CRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AARNet operates under an access and usage policy which admits not only AVCC member institutions and CSIRO but other organisations with compatible interests. AARNet has proposed the introduction of volume charging of institutions from 1 January 1995. Such a system is intended to place AARNet on a self funding basis. Ongoing financial assistance to assist with AARNet's recurrent costs is not seen as an appropriate function of Government funding programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to consider AARNet in the broader context of research data networks in general. An Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) study is currently examining the question of research data networks and has issued a draft report. The questions of the appropriate roles for AARNet, a private company, and the wider issue of the Government's role in supporting data networks, will be examined in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Government implement the main recommendations of the NBEET report which was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">research infrastructure should be increased by $120m per annum in order to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">restore parity between infrastructure support and Commonwealth direct research funding to pre-unification levels ($56m);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide incentives for universities to form closer ties with industry in line with Government policy ($20m); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide infrastructure support for the university funded portion of CRCs ($46m). (Page 68)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1 in the 1993 NBEET Report Higher Education Research Infrastructure pressed for an increase in funding under the Infrastructure program. The Government did not accept the NBEET recommendation: it was based on the arbitrary benchmark of 1987 funding levels, and on universities' own reporting of their infrastructure needs. There is no current, objective inventory of institutions' infrastructure that indicates its condition and use. However, DEET agrees that the widespread concern about deficiencies in research infrastructure needs to be addressed and is exploring options in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that, because of the widespread concern about the cost-benefits of further concentration of research resources, no further research centres should be established until a thorough and independent analysis has been undertaken of the effectiveness of existing centres. (Page 81)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that there should be a balance between concentration and plurality in university resource operations but sees no reason for a moratorium on the establishment of Centres funded by the Commonwealth. In this context it should be noted that there are Centres other than those established by the Commonwealth. The recommendation may be directed more towards higher education institutions which have established a large number of `centres of excellence' (over 800 according to a 1992 report by the Centre for Research Policy at the University of Wollongong), rather than the twenty competitively selected Special Research Centres currently funded by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A study of research concentration was commissioned by the ARC and the outcomes of this study were released as the NBEET report The Effects of Resource Concentration on Research Performance, quoted by the Committee (pp 76-77). The initiative for the study arose in part from the findings of the Review of the Centres Programs (the Lazenby Review) which found deficiencies in data on which to assess policy implications in this area. The Lazenby Review nevertheless found that the Centres Programs had produced a group of highly effective centres which had concentrated research and research training to produce very good results both in terms of quantity and quality. The Resource Concentration study finds that concentration should not be a policy objective in itself but might be appropriate in certain circumstances or for other objectives, such as achieving top international recognition for particular fields of research in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Renewal of funding for existing Special Research Centres and Key Centres of Teaching and Research is dependent on independent reviews every three years, with a maximum funding period of nine years. The Centres Program itself was reviewed in 1991 (the Lazenby Review referred to above) and will be reviewed again in 1996 as part of the cycle of evaluation activities agreed between DEET and the ARC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no new selection round for Special Research Centres planned, although proposals for a new round of Key Centres of Teaching and Research will be sought in late 1994. In addressing whether to fund further Special Research Centres DEET and the ARC will consider the issues of research concentration and productivity, available studies and reports, and other research initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the ARC reaffirm its recognition of "relief from teaching" as a legitimate and valuable component of research support, and that this provision should be more readily exercised than appears to have been the case to date. (Page 85)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is provision for `relief from teaching' in ARC programs. The Large Grants program, for example, includes in the guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advisory panels are prepared to consider requests for support to relieve a staff member of teaching and other duties where a panel is convinced that this is essential for the research and successful outcome of the project. Requests should be shown in number of months  required and must be prioritised carefully in respect of the other needs of the project. Requests should be endorsed by the relevant head of department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Guidelines for the Collaborative Research Grants state:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ARC is prepared to consider requests for support to relieve a staff member of teaching and other duties where this is essential for the successful execution of the project. The institution [will be] recompensed up to a fixed rate . . . irrespective of the level of appointment of the staff member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ARC recognises that relief from other duties is a legitimate and valuable part of research support. This is especially so where research involves an industry partner requiring expeditious outcomes or where projects involve a significant `write-up' phase. While relief from teaching is not essential in all cases, the ARC panels view each request for support on its merits. Institutions can provide support of this kind from general institutional funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that research funding practices continue to allocate resources on the basis of merit. There should be no attempt to reallocate general university research funding on the basis of assumptions, whether justified or not, about a particular institution's intrinsic quality. (Page 96)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scarce research resources should continue to be allocated on the basis of merit in the light of the selection criteria for the respective funding programs. The allocation of funds under current DEET/ARC programs is consistent with this principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that, in its funding decisions, the ARC meet its special responsibility for basic research. It must ensure that basic research expenditure constitutes no less than 65% of total higher education research and development funding. (Page 111)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  The need to support basic research is recognised but this specific recommendation is not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basic research is an important element of the research effort of higher education institutions, which also includes strategic, experimental-developmental and applied research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its Science and Technology Budget Statement 1993-94, the Government described a vision of Australia `which has captured the benefits of a strong scientific. . . base to provide economic prosperity, social equity, ecologically sustainable industries and a high quality, fulfilling lifestyle'. The Statement affirms basic research as a vital element in achieving this agenda and funding for basic research in the higher education sector is described as a legitimate function of Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that there are competing funding requirements and difficulties in defining the different types of research, and that the ARC cannot control higher education research expenditure overall, the ARC should not be required to maintain a certain percentage. The ARC has made a strong commitment to appropriate levels of basic research across the full spectrum of DEET/ARC research programs and will endeavour to ensure that its funding recommendations maintain a balance among its primary objectives, of which maintaining the research base is one.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the Committee's concern that the research funding needs of the humanities and social sciences be addressed through suitable structures.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ASTEC report, Bridging the Gap: The Social Sciences and the Humanities in Australia (May 1993), notes that the humanities and social sciences have been relatively ineffective in disseminating their knowledge through the general media.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more effective communication of research outcomes, including but not restricted to the humanities and the social sciences, may be warranted. However, any new expenditure proposals would be subject to formal consideration by the Government in a budgetary context.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendation draws on the `unacceptably high failure rate' of the program where `many high quality projects are rejected' for funding. While it is true that a considerable number of proposals do miss out on funding, this should not be seen in isolation from other factors in assessing the health of the program. Funds available for the Research Grants program, of which Large Grants is one component, have increased significantly over recent years. In addition the Government has provided an extra $12m in 1994 for research grants (Large, Small and Collaborative). This demonstrates a strong commitment to the maintenance of the Large Grants program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could not be assumed that funding for Large Grants would be the highest priority if additional funds did become available. Infrastructure requirements and the need to strengthen collaboration between higher education researchers and industry through programs such as the Collaborative Research Grants and Australian Postgraduate Awards (Industry) would appear to have claims which are at least as strong.</PARA>

The Government's position is that institutions should take such undertakings seriously. The allocation of infrastructure funds, from any source, is entirely a matter for institutional administrators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent of the Committee is to achieve a radical realignment of the way major parties in the administration of the higher education research program interact to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery. The intention, but not the means of achieving it, is supported. DEET has reached agreement with the NBEET and the ARC on the formation of an ongoing joint consultative group to manage ongoing discussion of resources and other issues of concern to all parties. Earlier, a tripartite consultative committee comprising DEET, NBEET and ARC representatives, was established to undertake a joint review of support arrangements for the ARC</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stage One of the joint review concluded in November 1993 with positive outcomes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it will take some time to implement the package of reforms arising from the review, indications to date are that the relationship between the ARC, the Research Branch and the NBEET has been strengthened and research program administration processes significantly improved. It would be costly and inefficient to disrupt the implementation of these changes by introducing a completely new structure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. These recommendations deal with the establishment of an Australian Tax Commission and, in that context, the roles of advisory committees, and other organisational arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The Government does not accept these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Government is of the view that the underlying concerns of the Committee can be and are being addressed under existing administrative arrangements. For example, the ATO has already recruited, on the basis of merit, people from the private sector to fill senior positions. Other initiatives to improve the commercial understanding and business acumen of ATO staff include external placements for its technical officers. The organisation has also enhanced its consultative processes by establishing new advisory bodies to address a range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Government notes that the Commissioner of Taxation, and the ATO, are accountable to Parliament and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Commissioner already has a reasonable degree of discretion in budgeting for operational activities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. The creation of an Australian Tax Commission may also compromise the fundamental independence of the Commissioner of Taxation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Greens welcome this report of the inquiry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The organisation and funding of research</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">in higher education</EMPHASIS> because of perceptions of alarming trends across university research activity&mdash;trends such as inadequate research infrastructure, the move to overly commercialise and exploit research findings to the detriment of objective research outcomes, the economic imperative in the choice of funding particular kinds of research and the emerging imbalance between humanities and science research being funded. It was an encouragement that some of these issues would begin to be dealt with at the announcement of the inquiry, which looked at issues such as changes in the pattern of research activity, research infrastructure, concentration of research, maintenance of plurality, links between higher education institutions and industry and the allocation of research related funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the report are ultimately reasonable. It is a disappointment that many of the recommendations will not be taken up by government. I make some comments about the recommendations that we believe need to be followed through. The recommendation of page 43 that mechanism B infrastructure funding be retained, we believe, is essential for ex-CAEs and the newer, poorer and smaller universities to compete with the big universities, commonly referred to as the `big eight'. It is therefore a disappointment that the government will not be supporting this recommendation because it believes five years is enough time for them to have caught up. The government's response is that it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reasonable that former advanced education institutions compete for infrastructure funding on the same terms as all other institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>That says it all. We agree that they should compete on the same terms, but they are not yet on the same terms and that is why mechanism B funding needs to be continued for a while longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest proof that former CAEs could not compete was the quality assurance process earlier this year that had an almost perfect correlation between the biggest amounts of research funds and the largest, oldest, richest and more established universities. Five years worth of special funding may improve the bottom denominator position of the ex-CAE's position, but they still cannot compete with institutions that have been around for the best part of this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens, however, endorse the calls of the Senate Standing Committee for Employment, Education and Training for more research infrastructure through a number of recommendations on pages 43, 54 and 68, of which none have been supported by the government. The government is not serious about putting any more funding into infrastructure which is so badly needed by students. It is a poor testimony to the government's commitment in this area when it quotes its own 1987 benchmark figures for research infrastructure and then shrugs off the fact that we have not got enough funding at 1987 levels as `just being an arbitrary benchmark anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens welcome the government's move to investigate a further $10 million for a unified national library system and money for the upgrading and extension of AARNet. The Greens are also pleased to see that the government has given in-principle support for a pilot scheme to assist with setting up media to communicate knowledge gained from the humanities and social sciences. Society will be able to learn from such feedback for the growth and wellbeing of the community as individuals and as a cohesive group. Scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs have no shortage of publicity and the public relations machine behind them as they ultimately spell credit for Australians and profits; that is, if they stay in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government has perhaps acknowledged through supporting this recommendation in principle that humanities and social sciences have a low profile, there is little recognition in its response to the recommendation on page 111 about the imbalances between basic research and strategic research. It is a disappointment, indeed, that the government would not support a basic public funding expenditure rate for basic research. Much of strategic, experimental, developmental and applied research is funded by industry and public funding is needed to maintain levels of basic research expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other gains to be made by maintaining the level of public funding on research subject categories and types of research. Public funding of research can keep up our knowledge to meet social, humanitarian and environmental ends that would suffer in an allocation of private funding which would favour outcomes and research dominated by economic imperatives. Not only does the government need to make sure that our tertiary research system does not subordinate its social aims to the domination of the market and corporate managerialism, it must also ensure the balance between industry favoured strategic research and basic or pure research. Strategic research may be manipulated by private funding sources also, as outcomes can be biased to meet business needs. I remind honourable senators that private funding does not mean that business ends up paying; it is the taxpayer who ends up paying the majority through tax concessions to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, our universities are our biggest employers of researchers and undertake Australia's best quality research. The government's response to the findings and recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training do not adequately reflect this perception. In failing to supply adequate resources to facilitate top quality research, the government is not serving students, university staff or society in an effective way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the Northern Territory government's report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The 205-page report, now tabled in federal parliament, is one of considerable significance. This was acknowledged by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Robert Tickner, in correspondence to me prior to the tabling of this report. I urged the minister, senators and the media to read the report carefully, particularly for the historical responses to many identified problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Northern Territory government is committed to implementing the recommendations, it is concerned that the process will take much longer if the Commonwealth `does not provide the financial capacity'. Currently the Northern Territory government is actively involved in implementing 336 of the 339 recommendations of the royal commission. Let me stress those figures: 336 of 339. That is a remarkable record of achievement. There have been extensive changes to police general orders, legislation has been reviewed and programs across numerous departments have been modified to meet the recommendations. Almost all Northern Territory government agencies are commendably involved in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of these recommendations is being monitored in a number of ways. For example, a series of workshops has been planned to give Aboriginal organisations the opportunity to discuss directly with the responsible departmental officers the details of the implementations of the recommendations; and a full-time officer has been employed by the Northern Territory Office of Aboriginal Development, using a grant from ATSIC. This officer is working to raise the level of involvement by ATSIC's elected members in the monitoring process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In areas of community policing, the Northern Territory government is leading the way with its Aboriginal community police program and support for night patrols. According to the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, these programs are `not in response to the royal commission's recommendations, but programs undertaken by the government arising from the positive interaction between territory police and Aboriginal communities'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The territory's living with alcohol campaign is another first for Australia, and a measure of the territory government's concern about alcohol abuse. Once again the Chief Minister made an important point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the link between alcohol abuse and crime and subsequent imprisonment, this initiative of its own will have the greatest impact of any program that could be implemented by Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory government established the living with alcohol program in 1991 to try to reduce the costs of alcohol  related harm in the territory. The program incorporates the strategies of culture, control and care&mdash;culture to increase the community's knowledge, capacity and willingness to drink sensibly; controls on the supply and service of alcohol; and care for those who have alcohol related problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this report, more than $3 million of the living with alcohol funds have been allocated to Aboriginal organisations or programs in the territory. For example, money has been used to employ an alcohol counsellor, help establish a residential treatment program, support night patrols, and develop a program for young offenders. The link between alcohol abuse and criminal behaviour cannot be ignored or sufficiently stated. The Northern Territory report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the Aboriginal people who come into contact with the criminal justice system do so because of alcohol related offences. Responsible use rather than abuse of alcohol could reduce contact with that system.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the high level of territory Aborigines caught up in the criminal justice system, the territory has the lowest level of deaths in custody of any jurisdiction. Certainly this report is a tribute to the efforts of the Northern Territory government&mdash;in particular, the Office of Aboriginal Development&mdash;in addressing the royal commission's recommendations. The office not only compiled this significant report, but also maintains a broad, coordinating role in the implementation of the recommendations. While the Northern Territory government continues to work towards alleviating the socioeconomic disadvantage of many Aborigines, it is important to note that governments cannot force change. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments can continue to attempt to motivate, stimulate, and educate for change. In the end, however, it is Aboriginal people who will and who must choose the direction that they see as necessary to prevent further harm to their own people.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report, particularly for its impact in the International Year of the Family. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE (NEW ZEALAND) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements arrangements that have been agreed with New Zealand to facilitate obtaining evidence from New Zealand for use in Australian proceedings and from Australia for use in New Zealand proceedings, and to facilitate proof of each country's laws and official acts and documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, unless a witness is willing to attend voluntarily, evidence is obtained between Australia and New Zealand by means of a letter of request to the other country's judicial authorities or arrangements for evidence to be taken on commission. These methods are more cumbersome and expensive, and much less satisfactory, than obtaining the evidence of the witness directly in the course of the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements implemented in the bill provide for evidence to be given in the course of a hearing by requiring attendance of the witness at the court, or by evidence being given by video link or telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly similar arrangements to those contained in the bill were implemented in 1990 in relation to a very narrow range of competition law cases. These 1990 arrangements are replaced by the new and broader schemes in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements reflect the close relationship between New Zealand and Australia especially in, but not limited to, the economic area. There is a need for Australian New Zealand legal co-operation to keep pace with developments in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for-</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New Zealand Parliament passed complementary New Zealand legislation on 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements relating to subpoenas will apply in proceedings except criminal proceedings and family law proceedings. These exclusions were sought by New Zealand. The other arrangements will apply in all kinds of civil and criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories were consulted in the development of these arrangements, and gave broad support to them. To provide flexibility for States and Territories the arrangements for trans-Tasman subpoenas and taking evidence by video link or telephone will not apply automatically to State and Territory courts. They will apply to prescribed State and Territory courts, as well as to all federal courts.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the bill an Australian subpoena can be served in New Zealand if leave for service is given by a superior court judge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding whether to grant leave, the judge must take into account the significance of the evidence to be given or the document or thing to be produced by the witness, and whether it could be obtained by other means without significantly greater expense, and with less inconvenience to the witness.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subpoena must be served no later than a day specified by the judge and must be accompanied by a copy of the order granting leave, and an information notice setting out the witness's rights and obligations under the subpoena; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The witness's reasonable expenses of complying with the subpoena must be paid or tendered to the witness a reasonable time before the time for compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a special procedure is provided for a person served with a subpoena to apply to set it aside. An application to set aside may be made by fax to the appropriate court. It may be determined without a hearing if neither party objects, and must be conducted by video link or telephone if the person served so requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The subpoena must be set aside if the person cannot reasonably attain necessary travel document or compliance would expose the person to criminal or civil sanction (except a civil penalty under the Trade Practices Act). Grounds on which the subpoena may be aside include hardship or serious inconvenience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the subpoena only requires production of documents or things, it must permit compliance by producing the documents or things at a registry of the High Court of New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand subpoenas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill obliges persons in Australia who are served with a New Zealand subpoena in accordance with the bill and with New Zealand law to comply with it. Failure to comply without proper excuse is taken to be a contempt of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Video link or telephone evidence from New Zealand</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill enables courts to direct that evidence be taken or submissions made by video link or telephone from New Zealand where it is more convenient to do so. Such a direction may only be made where suitable facilities are available or can reasonably be made available.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this evening the Witness Protection Bill 1994. I feel that I have already gone through this process, no doubt because this matter has been before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I will not say that the government vigorously opposed reference of the bill to that committee, but I cannot say that it was willing to refer it. Nonetheless, the bill did go to that committee and during that process a number of flaws were identified and enlarged upon by a range of witnesses who came before the committee. I will deal with those flaws a little later in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority some time ago that there should be a legislative framework for a witness protection program. For years witnesses have been protected under I am not sure what legislative authority, but nonetheless that has been the case. It is a sad fact that if we want to get at criminals, by and large we have to use the evidence of other criminals to do so. Criminals do not generally share knowledge of their criminality with the world at large. There may be people who indirectly, in one way or another, have some knowledge of certain events&mdash;are, say, witnesses in terms of identification or people who have undertaken bookkeeping or carried out financial transactions and things of that kind. Unwittingly they may have played a part in transactions which they have recorded and which have been part of a larger plan. Such people may be able to give evidence as to those matters and obviously not themselves be what we would call crooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one wants to get at organised crime, and large scale white collar crime, one has to have someone on the inside who will give information to the authorities. The equally sad fact is that those people then necessarily fear for their lives. This is especially true of drug crime. A number of murders have been carried out in Australia which quite clearly have been part of a pay-back arrangement for information given, or have occurred because people have not paid bills or have acted in ways that have upset those further up the drug chain. That behaviour has made it abundantly clear to people that if they dob in crooks, especially drug crooks, they are taking their lives into their own hands and putting them at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In exchange for obtaining that information, society needs to offer some sort of protection. The question arises as to how that is done and as to the consequences of so doing. This piece of legislation in its original form is the government's first attempt at responding to the NCA committee's recommendations that there be a legislative framework for these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a particularly distressing notion of having to rely, by and large, on the evidence of crooks to catch other crooks. Relying on the evidence of a crook really calls into question our preparedness to stand by what we teach children to mouth from primary school onward: one is innocent until proven guilty. The whole criminal apparatus is set up on the basis that we are innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are properly or improperly charged with a criminal offence, one way that defence counsel will defend us is by attacking the crown witnesses. Under this principle of being innocent until proven guilty, the crown has to show that we are guilty. The crown has to lead evidence that convinces a judge or jury to decide that it is time for us to receive some sort of sentence and have a criminal record or add to our criminal record as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the defence has to do is show that there is sufficient doubt, such that the person charged does not get convicted. One way that doubt might be shown is to question the credibility of a witness. That is a very simple but fundamental point about how the criminal process works, and it is something about which we all ought to be concerned. Sometimes we slip into the comfortable misunderstanding that the operation of the criminal law only affects crooks. It does not. Lots of people get off; in other words, they are not found guilty but are back in the position, which they never left, of being presumed innocent. Therefore, we need to seriously consider the operation of these laws because innocent people are incorrectly charged. Innocent people are sometimes incorrectly convicted. When we had the death penalty, innocent people were sometimes put to their death by the state because mistakes were made. This is a vitally important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we come back to witness protection. The government had in mind that the commissioner of police and certain people to whom he could delegate some of these powers&mdash;but only a deputy commissioner for some of the powers and other people for others&mdash;could get a memorandum of agreement with these people. All of that could be kept secret, even from the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have read accounts in the newspapers where witnesses have got an indemnity from prosecution in exchange for providing the crown with more information. Anyone who has sat in on a trial of an indemnified witness has heard defence counsel say, `You are giving evidence here because you are getting off. You've got a motive for dobbing these other people in'. That is a fabulous way of putting the credibility of the witness to the test&mdash;a witness who, if believed, will send the accused to gaol. The credibility of that witness has to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that prides itself on its role in human rights areas. I do not criticise the contribution it has made thus far in that area. But, for a government that so prides itself, it is amazing that it would come up with a scheme where the whole details of that agreement would be kept from the court. Defence counsel would be wanting to argue that here was a person who was a protected witness on some sort of deal, but counsel would not know what the deal was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that, when a person is a protected witness, he or she has different expectations about what he or she will get. It is very sensible to have a memorandum of agreement as to what that person will get so that there is no misunderstanding and he does not come out three years later and say, `I was conned. I was lied to. I was promised $1 million and a house in Bali', or whatever. Under a memorandum of agreement it would all be there and clearly understood&mdash;`You give us this. We give you that.'. There are no problems with that. The problem is that defence counsel does not get to see whether there is a house in Bali, Burwood, Bankstown, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says, `There are very good reasons for that because you do not want to give all the details of the agreement away. If you do that you will probably give away the identity of the protected witness'. That makes a complete farce of giving the person the new identity. We come back to square one. At least the government has seen the light in that respect and agreed to an amendment which, in effect, will allow the details of financial support to be passed on to defence counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a disgrace that this bill was drafted in such a way that that would not have been allowed in the beginning. I come back to the point I originally made: I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that more often than not these protected witnesses are crooks. Surely the innocent person&mdash;and remember we assume that the person is innocent until proven guilty&mdash;is entitled to have his or her defence counsel get at as much information as possible to protect the innocence of the client. It was nothing short of disgraceful for the Commonwealth to come forward and originally suggest that none of the information should be available. I congratulate the government on making the change and seeing good sense in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other problems are associated with the bill, some of which the Commonwealth has sought to address. I see by amendment No.1 that a party or a possible party to legal proceedings will have to be notified that the commissioner will accept process issued by a court or a tribunal on behalf of the participant and nominating someone who will receive that process. A person might start a new life but have existing obligations. For example, he or she might have children and maintenance proceedings will have to be carried out, or such a person might be married and want to get divorced. Such a person's life just does not stop. There has to be some arrangement for handling those sorts of proceedings and this is a contribution in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment includes a person who is no longer a participant in the program but retains the identity that he or she was given. The government's third amendment simply adds a new clause 26A to the list of powers that can be delegated only to the deputy commissioner. The fourth amendment relates to information about financial support and that will allow some of that information to be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally think that in the end we will discover that more information could be given to defence counsel. I hope that in the not too distant future we will find a way to allow that because the concept of innocence until proven guilty is the fundamental basis of the whole thing. We cannot work on the basis that the crown is somehow the knight in shining armour and the defendant is guilty. That is the wrong way to look at these things. It is not the way our system works. At least this is a start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's fifth amendment is again a contribution to an infrequent occurrence. We have a protected witness with a new identity, a new business, new beard, new hair colour and all that sort of stuff and wittingly or unwittingly that person becomes a witness in some other and totally unrelated criminal or civil proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that person is to be a witness and someone says, `Do you have any prior convictions?' and that person says no, that is, of course, a lie. We are talking about Bob Smith, who is a crook and does have convictions, but not under his new name of Jim Brown. So that is a lie. We were going to condone that on all occasions, as we had to keep this person protected because of the initial assessment we made that it was worth giving this person a new identity, a fresh start, and so on, in order to get at this person whom we thought was a crook. Then for ever and a day we have to protect that person. Potentially, we may be allowing that person to lie to a court. It is not acceptable to be legislating to allow that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people would say, `That is not likely to happen. How unlucky are you going to be to be a witness twice in criminal proceedings?' The first time that person is a protected witness it will be for big criminal proceedings. By and large, someone is not going to be a protected witness for some tacky little offence. It has to be something really worthwhile to go to this effort. But the subsequent offence in respect of which the protected person is giving evidence may be a much less serious criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might think it is a lesser offence, but the stark reality is that most people charged with something for which the possible penalty is a gaol sentence do not think of it as a tacky little offence. It is their innocence and their freedom and they are desperate about it. They want the opportunity for their defence counsel to get stuck right into whatever witnesses are going to give evidence against them. We should not be depriving them of that. But once we make these deals with people who more often than not are crooks and we protect them for ever and a day we, for ever and a day, allow them to be a new person with no record in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I cannot recall the technical name for it, there are good reasons for wiping the slate clean after a period of time, to allow people to rehabilitate themselves and not carry this mistake with them for the rest of their lives once they have paid the price. I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, know all those arguments. There are good reasons for encouraging people who have had a criminal conviction to get a clean slate, but we need to understand that, once we make one of these deals, it is for the rest of that person's life, by and large. The other people that might be affected later down the track, unrelated to the proceedings in which we wanted this person to be protected, do not get this chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has an amendment. I want to make this point quite briefly because, if I make it now, I might not need to repeat it when we come to the committee stage. I saw the supplementary explanatory memorandum issued by the government, and it is quite deceitful. It states that, if a participant or former participant with a conviction&mdash;one of these people I am talking about with a record&mdash;is later required to give evidence in criminal proceedings in his or her new identity, the person must advise the commissioner. That is a good idea. The commissioner is then required to take appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This explanatory memorandum, issued by the government to explain what this clause says, further states that, if the person is to give evidence, the commissioner shall provide a copy of the person's convictions to the court, the prosecutor, the accused and his or her legal representative&mdash;in other words, give the defence counsel of this other person later down the track the right to challenge this witness as being unreliable because he or she is a crook. It further states that this will have the consequence of the witness and his or her family being provided with a further new identity and relocation again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the consequences of giving up the identity of the protected witness and how that person would have to be relocated at vast expense. I will come to the difference between those two later. But this clearly says that the commissioner shall provide a copy of the person's convictions. When I look to the clause, strangely it does not say that. It does not say anything like that. They are completely inconsistent. The clause says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After being notified under subsection (1), the Commissioner may take any action he or she&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the AFP thinks it may have a female commissioner soon but, since we only recently got a new one, I doubt that it will be soon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">considers appropriate in the circumstances, including disclosing to the court, the prosecutor and the accused person. . .</PARA>
<PARA>First-year law students learn the `may-shall' distinction. `May' means `Do it if you like, if you think it is appropriate'. But the explanatory memorandum says that the commissioner shall provide a copy. I think that is downright deceitful. It is not a typo. There is no way one would type `shall' instead of `may'. They are different words with different meanings. Something has gone wrong. I understand why the clause may be better left with the word `may'. It may be that the person's evidence is not crucial. A judgment has to be made here as to the balance in the cost&mdash;and not just in dollars. The enormous cost and effort involved in a further relocation of a protected witness must be balanced against what might be a minor criminal charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite that, if there is a potential for a custodial sentence or a large fine, and the charged person does not have a lot of money, it is that person's liberty that is at stake. And somebody is going to decide whether or not they will let the court know that one of the witnesses that is going to put that person in the clink is a crook. Somebody will decide that and nobody will report on who it is. I think there is something wrong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with the Witness Protection Bill 1994. The Australian Democrats favour the main thrust of the bill. However, as indicated in my dissenting statement in report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am concerned that the bill does not meet benchmark standards in some areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and foremost issue would be witness reliability. As the bill presently stands, the commissioner is not expressly required to consider the likely reliability of the evidence to be given by the potential witness as a matter which is relevant to the decision as to whether the person should be admitted to the program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this is the prime consideration for the commissioner when he makes that decision. We want to ensure that this sort of decision is not made lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism of the practices adopted in this area and of a previous decision. It was the central criticism made by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The NCA and James McCartney Anderson</EMPHASIS>. The criticism was: given Anderson's background, his own criminality and his suspect credibility and motivation, why was he given protection in the first place, given that it gave him de facto immunity from prosecution? I believe it is essential that the bill impose very explicitly the obligation on the commissioner to safeguard the public interest by measuring the benefits that could be obtained from giving protection to a witness against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which gives us some concern is the area of fulfilling financial commitments. It is notorious that witness protection programs have been manipulated by participants to avoid existing financial obligations to the detriment of creditors and others. I note that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was conscious of this and recommended that any legislation in this area should contain sufficient protection, without specifying what those provisions might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, however, the view of the Australian Democrats that the bill does not go far enough in protecting the rights of those who are creditors of the witness or who may have other orders, such as maintenance orders, against the witness. In respect of civil debts, I note that the comparable United States scheme makes elaborate provision for creditors to enforce their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next area I wish to draw to the Senate's attention is the area of inter-agency cooperation. We are somewhat surprised that the opportunity has not been taken in this bill to require some formality in the various informal arrangements, which currently are in operation, which allow the commissioner to obtain false documents necessary to establish new identities. We are concerned to ensure that the arrangements by which new identities are established are subject to ministerial supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that, when the bill is quiet on this aspect, it condones the current practice where these matters are arranged between the commissioner and relevant departments on a nudge and a wink basis. But it seems to us for the protection of the process, for the protection of the departments providing the necessary documentation and for the protection of the commissioner, that such arrangements must be recorded, must have some formality and must be able to be referred to if they are challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area in the bill as it stands that I would question is the fact that it makes no provision specifically to protect the interests of children and of custodial and non-custodial parents in child custody arrangements. It is, I believe, important that the bill specifically protect the interests of these parties and, in particular, of course, the welfare of children, when we are talking about giving protection to witnesses who may be exposed to obligations in this area. Again I note that the United States bill makes quite elaborate provisions in respect of child custody arrangements. The bill that is now before the Senate is silent on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to the matter that I raised in the first part of my speech&mdash;that is, the public interest and the weighing off between the public interest of protecting the community and getting value, if you like, in respect of the immunity that is being extended to a protected witness&mdash;is consideration of the danger that is present in the relocation process. The bill does not require the commissioner to have regard to interests of public safety when considering, amongst other things, the reasons why a witness should be relocated. The US legislation, once again, makes such provision. I wonder why the drafters of this bill, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), have not turned their minds to this particular area. It would seem to us that it is in the public interest to have such a requirement included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that causes us some concern is that, as it stands, the legislation will not provide for disclosure of the nature of the memorandum which states the circumstances of the relocation and the protection extended to the witness, even in a courtroom context. The nature of the memorandum is not to be disclosed, full stop. How then will it be possible in cross-examination to test the suggestion that testimony has been bought? The response that clause 5 states that inclusion of a witness in the program is not to be done as a reward or as encouragement for giving evidence is, I believe, not a sufficient answer. The circumstances and the details of the memorandum should be available to be tested in court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that clause 5 is sufficient assumes that, just because the bill says it should not be done, it will not be done. What is required, however, is that it can be tested in court subsequently. As his Honour Mr Justice Frank Vincent suggested in his submission to the Victorian legal and constitutional committee in its review of the operation of the Victorian act, in some cases it will be necessary for the general nature of the memorandum to be disclosed so that this issue can be explored in cross-examination. Yet the bill currently before the Senate does not make any reference to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to ensure that, if a witness is given protection and provided with relocation and a new identity, the community, as it were, receives some value for that concession. We are concerned that the bill does not proscribe the inclusion of clauses in the memorandum of understanding that threaten consequences if the witness does not give evidence in the contemplated form. The Democrats would have no concerns in this regard if it is the wish of the authorities to make indemnities from prosecution contingent on giving the right evidence. Indemnities can be given by the DPP and can be cross-examined upon. If a person gets a lower sentence on the promise of giving evidence in the right form, that too can be subject to cross-examination. However, the secrecy of the memorandum of understanding should not be exploited to hide such deals, and I believe this matter needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill provides no mechanisms to enable the minister to be kept informed of the operation of the act and to allow for reporting to parliament. The reporting aspect that I believe is required should be based on the statements by the NCA and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who have both said that ministerial supervision is essential if schemes such as this are to be kept on the rails. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have set out the concerns that the Democrats have in relation to this bill. As I said, while we support the general thrust of the bill, which is long overdue&mdash;and we must regulate this activity&mdash;we have concerns that these matters have not been addressed. I will be moving amendments in respect of those concerns during the committee stage of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Witness Protection Bill, which is before us today, is one step in the right direction towards fighting organised crime in Australia. It is no secret that the protection of witnesses and their families is important to encourage witnesses to come forward and to ensure that their evidence is heard at trials.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me bring to the chamber's attention the plight of yet another key prison informant whose crucial evidence recently led to the conviction of a prison officer involved in serious drug trafficking offences within South Australia's maximum security prison, Yatala Labour Prison. I highlight this case to remind colleagues that, if this legislation is to work effectively, there is a need to ensure that state law enforcement agencies entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out similar witness protection programs be made accountable for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prison informant in this case, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, agreed last year to assist the Anti-Corruption Branch in South Australia by providing invaluable information which resulted in identifying a corrupt prison officer found to be smuggling illegal drugs to prisoners for financial gain.

One of the problems identified under the Witness Protection Bill 1994 is the protection of witnesses who are already held in prison. The effectiveness of this bill will be seriously undermined if we cannot give witnesses&mdash;such as the informant to whom I have referred in relation to these letters and the video, who is of course the same person&mdash;suitable protection.

But this officer, despite being found guilty, will not spend one day in gaol because the judicial system allowed him a three-year suspended sentence with a two-year non-parole period. The police and the courts failed to suppress this informant's identity during the course of the trial. His safety is now at risk as he waits in a New South Wales prison, fearing retaliation by inmates or prison officers who know what he has done. I have very real concerns about the limited accountability measures in this bill because it would seem, as has happened in South Australia, that no-one is willing to take the responsibility for looking after our whistleblowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question about this informant's evidence. It led to the conviction of a corrupt prison officer. Much more is contained on the videotape to which I have referred which implicates other corrupt officers. It is no wonder that today this man feels as though he waits on death row because of a failure to provide adequate witness protection. It would seem that in Australia, we have a poorly managed method of protecting our witnesses who expose and uncover corruption and criminal activity. Just ask Raymond Denning's family in New South Wales. We cannot afford to make a mistake with the provisions in this bill because people's lives are at stake.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My reading of this amendment is that clause 26A deals with the disclosure of a person's former criminal record if that person is called to give evidence in a criminal matter. Subclause 26A(2) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After being notified under subsection (1), the Commissioner may take any action he or she considers . . . including disclosing to the court, the prosecutor . . . the criminal record of the participant or former participant.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Vanstone is correct that the commissioner has a discretion. That subclause also says that will be applied when `he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances'. The explanatory memorandum in clause 5 provides in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the person is . . . to give evidence for the prosecution, it is intended that the Commissioner shall provide the prosecution, the court, the accused or his/her legal representative . . . a copy of . . . criminal conviction.</PARA>
<PARA>I am informed that although there is an apparent inconsistency between the bill and the explanatory memorandum, the bill is in discretionary terms and the explanatory memorandum is in mandatory terms. The use of the mandatory term in the explanatory memorandum is intended to give guidance to the commissioner in the exercise of his or her discretion, under this provision, in one situation where it is intended that the conviction be disclosed. That one situation is the one I mentioned earlier, where there is a real possibility of a gaol term or substantial pecuniary penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other circumstances it may not be appropriate for the conviction to be disclosed; that is, where the accused is called as a witness. So there is a broad discretion in the bill but the explanatory memorandum tries to target those more serious offences and suggests in that targeting that the record be disclosed in a mandatory way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite extraordinary that explanatory memoranda are now being used to offer guidelines to departmental secretaries or police commissioners as to what they ought to be doing. One would have thought that it should be manifestly clear on the face of the legislation&mdash;that would be ideal and that is what we should be aiming for&mdash;or, if that is not possible, that these matters be dealt with by way of regulation. It could be made clear in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought an explanatory memorandum was provided to explain what the act was about&mdash;and this does not. It is not an apparent inconsistency; it is an obvious, direct, clear as a bell, hit you in the face inconsistency. There is no point going on about it. It has happened&mdash;and people can form their own conclusions as to its appropriateness. I put the view that it is completely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point that it is all very well to say that this is guidance for the police commissioner in serious cases. Presumably, what the minister is saying is that where there is any gaol penalty involved the matter would be serious. The minister also talks about a serious financial penalty. But what is serious to one person may not be serious to another. Let us take, for example, someone who is out of a job and on some sort of allowance. Any pecuniary penalty will be very serious for that person. It may put that person in debt and other consequences may flow from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is serious to us as a nation is not the way to assess what opportunities we give people to maintain their liberty or save their property if they incur a fine. It is totally inadequate to say, `We, the state, will decide whether this is important. If it is not, you poor schmuck citizen will not get the benefits that you would normally get because, frankly, we have higher priorities than you or your rights.' It is an appalling situation to be in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister raised the point that that is not intended to apply when the protected witness is giving evidence on behalf of the accused. There is another way that he could delineate this. One could easily legislate and say that where evidence is being given against the accused&mdash;that would narrow it down&mdash;the information must be given. One could put an `if' on it. For example, if a gaol penalty is attached to the offence and the protected witness is giving evidence against the accused, the information must be given. That would be ideal because someone's liberty would be at stake. The evidence could deprive people of their liberty. The minister could make that appropriate change. I ask him to consider doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I am correct, this bill does not specifically override parliamentary privilege so there will be an opportunity a year or two after the implementation of this bill to get from the commissioner some good understanding of the number of instances under which he has been so advised and what he has done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will get the opportunity to revisit this later, but I would rather it be done now. I understand the need to get the program in place. The minister may have witnesses lined up with whom he wants to get agreements. But he should not think for a minute that this is the end of this matter. It is not. We will be rehashing it in 12 months by going through the legal and constitutional affairs committee. We will go right through what the commissioner has done. We will do it in another 12 months if this cannot be fixed then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the point about civil proceedings. The minister rightly says that in criminal proceedings, if there is a serious financial penalty, consideration will be given to making this information available. But, equally, in civil proceedings there are plenty of occasions when the reliability of one witness can turn a case one way or another. In those proceedings, the outcome is always&mdash;presumably nearly always, anyway&mdash;financial. In civil proceedings one would assume that, since the courts are so expensive to use, the financial outcome will be very substantial. It is so expensive to use the courts that people would not be in court and the evidence of a protected witness would not be used unless a very serious financial outcome was pending on the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the minister does not give the police commissioner any opportunity at all to advise the court in those circumstances. If it is good enough for the protected witness to advise the commissioner when he or she is a party, as a witness, to criminal proceedings&mdash;in some other unrelated matter&mdash;why is it not good enough to do it in civil proceedings? If a $5,000 or $10,000 fine in criminal proceedings is enough to consider giving away the new identity and relocating the person, why should we not consider the $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 outcome in civil proceedings to be equally important? It is important to someone who loses money, particularly when he does not have much. He does not draw a distinction by saying, on the one hand, `Oh well, this is okay. I lost this money because I lost a civil proceeding', and, on the other hand, `It is not okay because I lost a criminal proceeding that was being run against me.' People want the money and they think that it is being improperly being taken from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have the situation where evidence from an unreliable witness is used to impose a financial penalty on a person in a criminal proceeding or has occasioned someone to lose money in a civil proceeding. We could also have the situation where counsel for the plaintiff in a civil proceeding or counsel for the defendant in a criminal proceeding did not have the opportunity to test the reliability of that witness. People do not care whether it is civil or criminal proceedings. All they want to know is what it is going to cost them. I would be interested to see what the government has to say to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the Democrats' amendment No. 1, for a number of reasons. Though I understand the motivation of Senator Spindler in this matter, I think it is worth recognising that this amendment is to subclause (a). Clause 8 sets out a number of matters that must be taken into account when assessing a witness for placement. It does not preclude other matters being taken into account. The role of the commissioner in this context is fundamentally important. That role is to provide protection to the witnesses placed on the program, not to assess the veracity of their evidence. It is not the commissioner's role to assess the reliability of a witness. The AFP general orders and police instructions relating to procedures for assessment for placement require the AFP to seek the advice from the relevant director of public prosecutions as to the nature of the evidence and the importance of the witness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stressed, it is not the practice of the AFP to rely upon the police case officer's assessment of the witness. A witness may have made a convincing statement in writing, but it may become obvious that he or she is an unreliable witness only after cross-examination. Moreover, in all these cases and in all aspects of criminal law, the reliability of a witness and his or her evidence is ultimately a matter for the jury to determine. Although I can understand what Senator Spindler is trying to do, what he is in fact doing is giving the commissioner a role which is not part of the purpose of the legislation.

<PARA>Today the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner has concluded, in the report that has been tabled, that sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code should be immediately repealed, and that if the Tasmanian government will not take this action then the relevant provisions of Tasmanian legislation must be overridden by appropriate federal legislation. However, based on what we now know of the government's plans to deal with Tasmania's discriminatory legislation, it could be argued that the federal government's response is anything but appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Commissioner has concluded that Tasmania's laws are inconsistent with several specific rights which Australia has undertaken to protect by its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These are: the right to privacy, article 17; the right to non-discrimination, article 2.1; and the right to equality before the law and equal protection before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, there are three possible approaches to overruling the obnoxious Tasmanian laws. The narrowest of the three is the right to privacy. However, it would appear that this is the approach adopted by the federal government. Clearly, it could not have done much less and retained any credibility for its claim that it stands for equality before the law for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Commissioner explained that one of the most fundamental provisions of the convention requires the rights recognised therein to be respected and ensured to all individuals within Australian jurisdiction `without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status'. In the commissioner's view, `this provision applies to discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference or sexual orientation affecting the rights recognised in the convention'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this right not to be discriminated against, the Human Rights Commissioner notes a further reason for the view that the Tasmanian law contravenes our international obligations. Article 26 of the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property or other status.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Human Rights Commissioner points out, as with article 2.1 the grounds of discrimination enumerated in the second sentence of this provision clearly do not constitute an exhaustive list. Sexual preference is therefore not excluded because it is not specifically listed. Moreover, the first sentence of article 26 recognises the right to equality before the law and requires equal protection for all persons `without any discrimination'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be clear from all this that the government clearly had the power to enact the laws to comprehensively legislate against discrimination in all its forms and to ensure that no governments, state or Commonwealth, enact one law for some and another law for others. Such legislation would also have enabled progress in adjusting the age of consent to remove the inappropriate differential between heterosexual and homosexual behaviour in most states. However, it now appears that reform will continue on a piecemeal basis as evidenced by the government's foreshadowed legislation and by a successful amendment to the industrial relations legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual preference. I wish the government had taken that as an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is disappointing that the Australian government has not had the courage to tackle the issue of equal rights for gay and lesbian people in a decisive way by introducing comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. It is clear that there should be one law for all Australians and that we should not spuriously use the argument of so-called states' rights to override the rights of Australians, no matter where they live. </PARA>

If we are to take the human rights commission seriously, we have a right to expect that it would review and do its research in an appropriate and mature manner and not simply regurgitate the pathetic decision of the United Nations. That is really what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Human Rights Commission has made its report, relying very heavily on previous United Nations and European court decisions, raises the question why Australia abolished appeals to the Privy Council. We abolished those appeals because we wanted Australian law determined in Australia by Australians and not by a foreign body in London. We have simply changed the venue with these reports now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of having the decisions made for us in London by the Privy Council, we are going to Geneva. What is the difference, other than the fact that the Geneva based body does not have the legal expertise of the former Privy Council?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am more concerned about losing the time, Mr Acting Deputy President, but thank you. I was pointing out the narrowness of the federal government response to the provisions in the Tasmanian criminal code, which are shown in this report by the Human Rights Commissioner. While we are yet to view the legislation, it seems that the legislation put forward by the Attorney-General will rely on the privacy issue, which will put Australia in breach of articles 17 and 2.1 of the ICCPR. Senator Abetz's comments give an illustration as to why it might have been far better if the federal government could have taken the third avenue available to it, which is the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report and the legal advice that the Greens (WA) have received indicate that the parliament can enact legislation to ensure that there is equality before the law for lesbians and homosexual men. The combined effect of section 26 of the ICCPR and the external affairs power of the Commonwealth gives the government the legislative power to pass such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would certainly be a more constructive step which would allow Australia to embrace the positive concept of equality before the law for everyone, rather than having a federal act based on age of consent&mdash;which, of course, we know is a shambles, with different ages for males and females across the different states&mdash;and on the right to privacy. The right to privacy can be called in only as a defence, but it will not necessarily protect individuals from legal action either in Tasmania by the state government for the articles that are under consideration, or in Western Australia because the age of consent in that state is 21 for adults in relation to homosexual behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be regrettable if the issue were used politically as a states' right argument. I think Senator Abetz needs to know that it was quite within the grasp of the commissioner. In the report of the Human Rights Commissioner, he actually referred to the measures that Senator Abetz said that he had not. I believe that the Tasmanian laws as set out in the report were applied inappropriately. Section (e) on page 14 of the report, says:</PARA>

<PARA>This is quite an important treaty, and it has been the subject of some debate in the parliament and the estimates committees. Just prior to an election, Mr Keating flew to a conference of Pacific leaders in Nauru and decided to settle $107 million as a compensation claim to the Republic of Nauru. This, of course, was a settlement that was taken before there was a final hearing of the International Court of Justice. In relation to the extensive debate in the Senate estimates committees, Senator Evans said that the government had decided that, in light of the preliminary hearings, it was unlikely that the case would be won. I think his words were to the effect that the judges had holus-bolus changed the precedence relating to international law, and the government decided to settle $107 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter raises a number of issues&mdash;and others have already spoken on this in the chamber&mdash;including the astonishing willingness of this government to submit itself to international courts. There were two other potential parties for the action that the Republic of Nauru had sought for compensation&mdash;the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Neither of those two countries allowed the international court jurisdiction. I do not know whether Senator Evans or Senator Crowley regards those countries, therefore, as bad international citizens but, of course, they did not cop the $107 million bill that Senator Evans and Mr Keating decided had to be paid to the Republic of Nauru. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia settled on $107 million, and then sought pro rata compensation from the governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This treaty indicates that the government of the United Kingdom has decided to make a compensation payment of not a third, but $12 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber today we have had a major debate about drought assistance&mdash;of what assistance should be given to our farmers who are suffering the worst drought on record. Some people in the chamber raised the matter of the $80 million the government is giving in respect of the friendship bridge across the Mekong; others raised the issue of the $80 million to $100 million that the government is giving to Nauru. The money seems to be available, but provided one is not an Australian. The first issue I wish to bring to the Senate's attention is the astonishing willingness of this government to submit itself to international bodies and tribunals and the consequences which can flow from that. The consequence is that Australia is up for an amount in the order of $80 million plus. That is the first consequence which flows from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second consequence is that clearly the United Kingdom and New Zealand did not feel the same way about this issue. So the United Kingdom, presumably after strong pleadings from Senator Gareth Evans, has decided to provide a payment of only $12 million&mdash;extensively short of the presumably pro rata share of over $30 million. This shows again how this government constantly misuses its treaty making powers and gets itself into serious problems. Other governments do not do that. The United Kingdom does not do that; New Zealand did not do that; but we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alright for Mr Keating to make a big fella of himself and pay massive compensation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to draw to the Senate's attention three topics of taxation importance. The first topic is the general investment allowance. Under the investment allowance provisions a 10 per cent deduction was available for the incurring of expenditure of a capital nature of more than $3,000 in acquiring or constructing a new unit of eligible property. To be eligible, the taxpayer must have first used or installed ready for use the equipment by 1 July 1994 under a contract entered into before 1 July 1994. The deadline has now passed and unfortunately the government failed to extend the availability of the allowance in the 1994 budget to stimulate investment by business in plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points that I wish to raise. Firstly, the provisions relating to the allowance, and particularly section 82AG(1)(a), withdraw the investment allowance where a taxpayer disposes of property or the property is lost or destroyed within 12 months of first being used or installed ready for use by that taxpayer. This provision operates to deny a taxpayer an investment allowance claim where an eligible piece of plant is destroyed, say, by fire and then replaced by an insurance company. There is inequity in denying the allowance to a taxpayer when the  taxpayer was not responsible for the loss and the insurance company replaces the equipment with identical equipment used for the same purposes as the original equipment. I believe that the anomaly is an unintended consequence of the relevant provisions and I call upon the government to rectify this matter with a degree of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 30 June closing deadline there was a flood of orders for plant and eligible equipment. Many firms in the automotive industry sought to take advantage of the allowance&mdash;not surprisingly. However, as an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 12 August indicated, taxation draft ruling TR94/D37 issued some six weeks after the 30 June deadline considers the meaning of the phrase `rights to use' and `contract or arrangement with another person for the use of the property by that other person' used in the relevant income tax act provisions. I believe that this is quite an appalling situation and I do not really think it reflects too well on the tax office. To issue a draft ruling which seeks to define essential terms of the legislation after the companies have purchased costly equipment is quite unfair. It is another example of the failings of the present rulings system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the second matter. I refer to an anomaly with respect to superannuation which has particular relevance to that part of Australia that is suffering from drought, where many of the farmers have to go out and take off-farm work. Many self-employed taxpayers are entitled to an deduction for their contribution to a superannuation fund under section 82AAT of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The availability of this deduction is very restricted by section  82AAS, particularly if the taxpayer is substantially self-employed&mdash;which most farmers would be. Taxpayers are considered substantially self-employed if they are engaged in eligible employment and derive assessable income of less than 10 per cent of their total assessable income for that particular year. The operation of section 82AAS and 82AAT has caused indignation to taxpayers with mixed sources of income&mdash;that is, self-employment and as an employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the Senate some examples to illustrate the problems that I have just highlighted. People caught by the operation of these provisions are, for example, medical practitioners who have fee for service arrangements with local hospitals and farmers. I note that last week a draft superannuation determination, SGC94/D3, provides that generally a visiting medical officer is an employee for superannuation guarantee purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evening I wish to emphasise the unjustness of this situation, particularly for farmers&mdash;but it can have relevance to, say, medical practitioners. A consequence of the application of these provisions is that farmers who take employment to supplement the dramatic fall in their income from farming activities as a result of drought, flood or other natural disasters, will often lose the deduction for their superannuation contributions. If their farming income is low, it would be very common for the employment income to exceed 10 per cent of the assessable income, particularly in drought when it is probably negative. In such circumstances, the provisions operate harshly to deny the farmer the superannuation contribution deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the employer's superannuation contribution will be so negligible that it could not be said to contribute to the farmer's retirement income. Again, I use this opportunity to call on the government to give serious consideration to amending the relevant provisions to give relief to farmers, particularly as we have such devastating drought conditions in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final issue I wish to raise this evening relates to the issue on 19 August last year of a draft public ruling TR93/D38. This relates to deductibility under the general deduction section, known as section 51(1). This draft ruling was largely issued as a result of the decision of the full Federal Court in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Roberts and Smith in July 1992. Despite the wide importance of this issue, a final ruling has not yet been issued, although a year has passed since the release of the draft. The draft received newspaper coverage, which suggested that the draft could be interpreted as allowing interest as a deduction when a couple borrows to finance the withdrawal of paid-in equity in an income earning investment property and then, while retaining the investment, uses the newly borrowed funds to acquire a family home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ruling would be of immense interest and importance to many couples around Australia. I therefore use this opportunity to call on the tax office to re-prioritise its rulings programs, to ensure that the final ruling is issued post haste. Fortunately, prudent and conservative practitioners have advised clients to await the final ruling. I believe that they have waited long enough, given the time elapsed since the Roberts and Smith decision and especially the resultant issue of the draft ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, however, I also draw attention to the fact that another draft ruling on a related topic&mdash;EDR 57&mdash;has yet to issue in final format, despite the draft ruling's release nearly three years ago. It is simply unacceptable for delays of this magnitude to occur and the Australian Taxation Office needs to revise its mechanisms for dealing with rulings urgently. I stress that a period of three years is far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may close on this point, it is very worrying to note that rulings favourable to the tax office can have a much quicker turnaround time. For example, TD94/D38 took only six weeks from the time of the issuing of the draft to finalisation. That determination held that 1985 or earlier tax office assessing handbooks cannot be relied on as evidence of current tax office interpretation, policy or practice with the result that rulings and determinations less favourable to a taxpayer can have future application. I take this opportunity to ask the government to address these three principal issues and related issues with the degree of urgency that they require. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few moments tonight to mark the passing, on 5 August this year, in the Woden Valley Hospital of the late Sir Frederick Wheeler who died at the age of 80 after a very long career&mdash;a career which, in my view, marked him as one of the greatest public servants this country has ever known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Sir Frederick for several years when he first went to the Treasury as its new Secretary late in 1971&mdash;a position that he held until his retirement in 1979. His work as Secretary to the Treasury was the climax of a great career of public service, but it came at the latter end of a career which by that stage had already been marked by many notable participations in the work of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Frederick joined the Public Service in 1939 after 10 years as an economist with the State Savings Bank of Victoria, and during the Second World War he was heavily involved in the activities of government. Indeed, one of his lasting monuments was his participation in 1945-46 in the preparation of the white paper on full employment. That was one of the hallmark documents of Australian government and Australian policy. He was also a member of the Australian delegation to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944-45 which subsequently led to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade&mdash;institutions which have had a seminal influence on international, economic and financial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1952, following a period of senior service in the Treasury, he was bypassed for the secretaryship of Treasury by the appointment to that position of Sir Roland Wilson, another great public servant who still lives here in Canberra at an advanced age. Sir Roland was appointed Secretary to the Treasury over Fred Wheeler in 1952. Sir Frederick then went to Geneva as Treasurer of the International Labour Organisation where he stayed until 1960. He then returned to Australia for personal, family and professional reasons and became Chairman of the Public Service Board where he remained until his appointment to the Treasury in 1971. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Frederick's time with the Public Service Board as its chairman marked a time of the greatest changes to the structure and development of the Public Service that we have seen in Australia. Many of the changes that were introduced under Sir Frederick's leadership at that time still remain, although sadly and regrettably subsequent governments, particularly the Whitlam and the Hawke governments, wrought major changes in the structure of the Public Service which I think have not been of benefit to Australia but to its detriment. Certainly Fred Wheeler was a major architect of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Frederick was the classic neutral, proper process public servant. Indeed, the one phrase that I always remember when I think of Fred Wheeler is that he would stress to all the people around him&mdash;and he built around him a strong loyalty both in the Treasury and Public Service Board&mdash;the need for what he termed due process. By that he did not mean a fuddy-duddy bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake approach to policy development and administration, but he was referring to following a logical proper sequence that was likely in the end to produce the most desirable result for the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Frederick showed complete loyalty to the government of the day, regardless of its political persuasion. In his time he had some almighty fights with governments. I know that some of them occurred in the years of the Fraser government, and certainly during his period in the Treasury there were many titanic battles with the Whitlam government, particularly during the time of the loans affair, not just the Khemlani affair but all the matters associated with the then government's attempts to borrow money for dubious purposes in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts were made to shift Sir Frederick from the Treasury because he stood up to the then treasurers, and in particular to Dr Cairns during his brief and inglorious time as Treasurer. He also had some major run-ins with the Prime Minister of the time, Gough Whitlam, because I think Whitlam did not fully understand what was going on around him in his own government. Sir Frederick saw it as his responsibility to advise the Prime Minister of what was happening because, as he said in one classic phrase, he wanted to correct the ignorance from which the Prime Minister was suffering through lack of information, an ignorance that would bring him down. In the end those proved to be prophetic words and Sir Frederick was proved to be right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst observing due process in everything he did in his public service career, he also built very strong teams around himself. He was a man who generated loyalty beyond the normal call of duty for those who worked with him. He was sometimes accused of having a lack of warmth. Personally, I found that not to be the case. I thought he was a very warm, generous person with whom it was very easy to work and who was very much a team-builder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a pretty risky operation to go and have a drink with Fred Wheeler at the end of the day. I have never known a person who could relax so well, smoke 80 cigarettes a day, consume a large quantity of whisky and never look at all under the influence of either. The fact that he lived to the age of 80 and in the end died of peritonitis&mdash;which was tragic&mdash;rather than any of the other things, namely, his addiction to cigarettes and a bottle of scotch, was testimony to his remarkable fortitude and stamina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to put a few of those thoughts on the record because the passing of Fred Wheeler has seen the passing of one of the really great public servants in Australia. I do not think that we will see the likes of Fred Wheeler again because of the changes that have occurred in the way government runs. We all owe Fred Wheeler a debt of gratitude for what he brought to public service in Australia. I am very pleased to have the opportunity and the privilege to say a few words along those lines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Over 80% of the pulplog intake for the Hampshire woodchip mill under construction by North Forest Products&mdash;formerly Associated Pulp and Paper Mills&mdash;is intended to come from the company's own forests. About 15% of pulplogs will come from Crown forests currently designated for wood production, while 2% of pulplogs will come from private land not owned by the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Harvesting rights for Crown forest are allocated by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Development Proposal and Environmental Management Plan prepared by North Forest Products to meet State Government requirements notes that the woodchip mill is a `discretionary use' within the zone described as `Zone Number 1&mdash;Rural' under the Burnie Interim Planning Order Number 1 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) North Forests Products has Commonwealth approval to export up to 170 000 tonnes of woodchips through Burnie following the construction of the Hampshire mill. These woodchips are currently exported through Longreach and are within the company's current woodchip licence of 1 878 000 tonnes per year. Accordingly the 170 000 tonnes approved for the Hampshire mill will not involve additional harvesting beyond currently approved operations. The precise extent and location of areas of old growth, in concession areas or freehold, that are intended to supply pulpwood to the mill will vary depending on the mix of old growth and regrowth, and plantations to be accessed each year. The Forestry Commission produces three year wood production plans which detail the planned Crown land coupes to be harvested over the plan period. The logs produced from harvesting these coupes of sawlog quality will be used for local sawn timber production, whilst the lower quality logs will be taken as pulpwood to the Hampshire mill or other pulpwood users. All harvesting and road construction operations, including those on private land, must, by State legislation, comply with the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Crown forests which supply North Forest Products are regenerated with local provenance eucalypt seed. The company's freehold forests have a long history of logging and are being largely replaced by eucalypts specially bred to yield high quality pulp. The export licence requires the planting of at least one hectare of land for every 1000 tonnes of woodchips exported by the company each year from private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Sawlog recovery rates vary depending on the productivity of each forest. That variation is a consequence of factors such as climate, soil and past forest management. As the value of sawlogs is much higher than that of pulplogs there is an economic incentive for managers of wood production forests to maximise sawlog recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) All sawlogs of the minor species are sold to sawmills. Pulplogs of minor species are first offered for sale on the local market, particularly with the craft industry in mind. Where there is no domestic demand for these logs, they are sold for chipping and may be exported under Commonwealth licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) I am not aware of any study of the comparative economic benefits of woodchip, ethanol and firewood production from pulpwood from the north west coast of Tasmania. However, paper production is likely to be the highest value attainable for most of the eucalypt pulpwood from Tasmania's north west production forests. The technology for the use of waste wood in ethanol production is still under development. Timber for firewood is a major energy source in Tasmania, particularly for households. The market for firewood from the north west coast is likely to be limited because of the relatively small local population and the high cost of transporting the wood over significant distances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Hon Ros Kelly MP, wrote to the then Minister for Resources, the Hon Michael Lee MP, on 14 December 1993 offering advice on these matters in relation to proposed woodchip export licence renewals for 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Minister did not ignore Mrs Kelly's advice. In response to Mrs Kelly's representations, a number of areas proposed for logging by the States were excluded from the approved licences, and the licences included conditions to minimise impacts on the national estate, to ensure the protection of endangered species, and to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, in writing to the licensees, Mr Lee indicated that they should have due regard to the objectives, policies and processes agreed by governments in the National Forest Policy Statement and should consult with State forest management agencies as appropriate on the adoption of these agreed policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas of Mrs Kelly's advice were taken up by Mr Lee directly with the State forests Ministers who have responsibility for those matters. Additional matters are being pursued by Commonwealth and State officials as part of the cooperative processes involved in the implementation of forest conservation initiatives under the National Forest Policy Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government is not in breach of its international obligations under the World Heritage Convention. The southern forests of Tasmania were investigated for world heritage values in 1986, and the areas now being harvested in the south-west of Tasmania were not designated as World Heritage Areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Parliament has designated these forests as part of Tasmania's Multiple Use Forests enacted through Tasmania's Public Land (Administration and Forests) Act 1991. These forests are being harvested to meet timber requirements during the transition of the State's hardwood sawmilling industry from old growth to regrowth forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) All the Recommended Areas for Protection (RAPs) are currently secure from logging under the Tasmanian Public Land (Administration and Forests) Act 1991. Nonetheless, Mr Lee, in informing the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Groom, of his approval of 1994 woodchip export licences, indicated his view that outstanding work on the reservation of these areas be progressed and formal action, such as the gazettal of the RAPs, be concluded as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)&mdash;(4) The Government has not concluded that homes with fewer than 30 beds will not be viable. It has, however, been of the view that homes with fewer than 20 beds are in fact inherently not viable and has provided assistance accordingly. The Small Homes Initiative provided additional recurrent assistance and also capital assistance to voluntary and private sector homes to enable them to restructure their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally accepted that very small homes are less economical to operate. For example, there must always be at least two staff on duty to allow a resident to be lifted, so a very small home may have the same nursing staff cost as a larger home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government has not done any costings specifically for this purpose, there is consensus in the industry that very small homes are not viable. Accordingly, people considering entering the industry may have been provided with advice to this effect, depending on the implications for viability of the particular nursing home design or structure contemplated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) and (6) Assessment by Aged Care Assessment Teams of frail aged people needing care ensures that people requiring care receive it in the most appropriate setting available. In practice, this means that most people with dementia who are active and otherwise healthy, but who require residential care, are in hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hostels are funded to provide care services to residents with a range of care needs including those arising from dementia. The scale of subsidies varies in recognition of the differing costs of caring for residents with different care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recently sponsored Aged Care Australia to conduct a survey of hostel financial performance which showed that a number of factors, including the proportion of residents with dementia, affect hostel financial performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hostels with more than half the residents with dementia or other cognitive or behavioural impairments (22 per cent of hostels) had higher costs per head than hostels with fewer such residents. Nonetheless, most such hostels achieved a place day surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey also showed that hostels with a high proportion of residents with dementia received higher levels of Government subsidy as well as higher levels of contributions from residents to help them meet their costs. The proportion of income from Government subsidies was higher than for other hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hostels which were dementia specific or which had separate dementia units (16 per cent of hostels) were more costly to run than integrated hostel facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Separate dementia facilities provide one model of care for residents with dementia. Available studies have not shown that separate dementia facilities provide better outcomes for hostel residents with dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The implication behind the question appears to be that people with dementia who do not require nursing home care, require a level of hostel funding different from that currently provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levels of personal care subsidy payable in respect of hostel residents since 1992 are Personal Care Low, Personal Care Intermediate and Personal Care High. Assignment into one or other category is done by assessment of relative need for care, as determined by the Personal Care Assessment Instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each category of personal care attracts a different level of subsidy. The great majority of people in Personal Care High and Personal Care Intermediate categories are people with special needs arising from cognitive or behavioural disorders, such as dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that this three category system allocates funding, in an equitable manner, against the relative care needs of hostel residents. The Government does not believe that dividing existing funding allocations into four categories would be in the interests of hostel residents or organisations providing hostel care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Dementia will tend to affect the degree to which assistance is required in one or more areas of care need, rather than result in needs radically different from those of other aged people needing hostel support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding provided to hostels for provision of care services is based on relative care needs, as assessed by the Personal Care Assessment Instrument. This instrument provides for a comprehensive consideration of the care needs of all aged people needing hostel care, whether or not they have dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is recognised that there is a subset of people with dementia who also have very disruptive behaviours, whom hostels and nursing homes find difficult to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, the Psychogeriatric Units established following the 1994-95 Budget will have access to funds with which they can supplement hostels and nursing homes caring for a resident with dementia and disruptive behaviours while care needs are being established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Government does not believe all dementia sufferers are better catered for in a nursing home than in a hostel. The need for hostel or nursing home care is determined by careful multi-disciplinary assessment, generally through an Aged Care Assessment Team, and consideration of the wishes of the person and their relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the 1994-95 Budget decision, the department has been asked to accelerate research into the care needs of people with dementia and disruptive behaviours, using the best academic and applied expertise that is available. The issue of appropriateness of different care models to different individual needs is central to this research.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office has advised that the decision of the Full Federal Court in the Edwards case is not authority for the deductibility of all expenditure on conventional clothing acquired and worn at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proper construction of subsection 51(1) does not result in a universal proposition that conventional clothing can never attract deductibility under the Act. Each case must be approached by the application of the subsection properly construed to its particular facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For expenditure by any employee to be deductible under the first limb of subsection 51(1) of the Act, the High Court of Australia has indicated that the expenditure must have the essential character of an outgoing incurred in gaining assessable income or, in other words, of an income producing expense (Lunney v. FC of T (1958) 100 CLR 478 at 497-498). There must be a nexus between the outgoing and the assessable income so that the outgoing is incidental and relevant to the gaining of the assessable income (Ronpibon Tin N.L. v. FC of T (1949) 78 CLR 47). Consequently it is necessary to determine the connection between the particular outgoing and the operations by which the taxpayer more directly gains or produces his or her assessable income (Charles Moore &amp; Co (WA) Pty Ltd v. FC of T (1956) 95 CLR 344 at 353; FC of T v. Cooper 91 ATC 4396 at 4403; (1991) 21 ATR 1616 at 1624; Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v. FC of T 93 ATC 4508 at 4520; (1993) 26 ATR 76 at 91). Whether such a connection exists is a question of fact to be determined by reference to all the facts of the particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing in the Full Federal Court's decision in the Edwards case changes these principles. The decision in the Edwards case is simply an example of a situation where, on the particular facts of the case, such a sufficient connection did exist. The analysis on the facts starts with ascertaining what are the income earning activities and then determining whether a sufficient nexus exists between those activities and the expenditure. Outgoings will be deductible in whole or in part where there is a clear connection between the expenditure and the actual derivation of income. It is not sufficient that the expenditure on clothing is a prerequisite to the derivation of assessable income. It must contribute to the derivation of that income.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government is aware of the invitation issued by the International Court of Justice to member states of the World Health Organisation, including Australia, to make submissions on the question of the legality of the use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict. An order of the Court dated 13 September 1993 fixed a time-limit of 10 June 1994 for lodging written statements on the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) After long and careful consideration, the Australian Government lodged a submission with the Court on 9 June 1994 arguing that the Court should exercise its discretion not to proceed with an opinion. I set out the reasoning behind the Government's position in my answer in the Senate to a question without notice by Senator Margetts on 2 June 1994, in which I incorporated the text of a letter on the subject to my parliamentary colleague Garrie Gibson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Government's decision was a finely balanced one taking into account very complex political, legal and strategic considerations. There has been considerable interest among community groups and from members of Parliament in this issue, and the Government has taken into account the wide range of arguments put to it by them. I personally and my Department have engaged in dialogue with individuals and representatives of interested organisations through formal consultative mechanisms, such as the National Consultative Committee on Peace and Disarmament, and through extensive correspondence, as well as on an informal basis with interested individuals. In the end, while understanding the motivations behind the WHO referral to the Court of the question of the legality of the use of nuclear weapons, the Government had strong doubts as to whether an advisory opinion of the Court would in fact assist the cause of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, or whether it would be more likely to complicate the important disarmament negotiations now taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Court treats the written statements submitted to it as confidential and will not release them to parties which have not made statements, at least until the Court has reached the oral hearing stage. The ICJ is not expected to reach the stage of oral hearings on the WHO referral before the second half of 1995. Accordingly, until that time, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government does not intend to release its submission as a public document. Nevertheless, the Government has made no secret of its thinking on this case and thus is prepared to provide interested individuals and community groups with further details of the approach in its submission to the Court.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Price increases in excess of inflation do not in themselves indicate misuse of market power by the newspaper industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, while newspapers play an important role in keeping the community informed, now more than ever before they are only one source of information. The emergence of new independent papers and magazines, the reach of teletext into homes and businesses, the plethora of magazine style television programs, computer bulletin boards et cetera point to an increasingly dynamic and diverse information industry. Competitive forces, such as these, and other factors such as advertising revenue, have a bearing on the cover prices of newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, the Government accepts that there may be a case to review prices in the newspaper industry, particularly if prices continue to rise. Such an inquiry would be time consuming given the complexities involved. The PSA already has a substantial workload in the lead up to establishing the new Australian Competition Commission. In particular it is conducting a review of all existing declarations under the Prices Surveillance Act and I regard this review as a matter of priority. The question of whether newspaper cover prices should be examined will be looked at after the declaration review is concluded.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) At the 1994 session of the United Nations Disarmament Commission (UNDC), Working Group III dealt with international arms transfers, including the illicit trade in arms. The Colombian representative prepared and circulated a working paper setting out proposed basic guidelines and recommendations designed to enhance international cooperation in the eradication of illicit arms transfers. As well as outlining and summarising the previous international consideration of this issue, the Colombian paper proposes the establishment of global mechanisms to control the trade in arms, together with greater state controls over the internal trade in conventional weapons (including firearms for self-defence or other personal use), domestic arms manufacturing, and the domestic use and manufacture of explosives. The paper also suggests the need to develop mechanisms that would facilitate the work of international authorities, such as Interpol, in tracing illegal weapons transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Although Colombia has been the major force behind the current UNDC discussions on international arms transfers, Australia has for many years been interested and involved in UN efforts on this issue, including through our participation in  the UN Experts Group in 1990/91, the first to have this issue as part of its mandate, which developed the UN Register of Conventional Arms. Many of the proposals in the Colombian paper were based on the Experts Group's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were not directly involved in formulating the proposals in the Colombian paper, but supported consideration of them by the UNDC. A lengthy procedural discussion in Working Group III about whether or not the Colombian paper should be annexed to the Working Group's report for future consideration was only resolved upon the adoption of a suggestion made by the Australian delegation that the paper should go forward to the next UNDC session as "one element for future consideration".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government supports the development of viable and feasible international guidelines as a basis for practical action to address the problem of the illicit trade in arms. While the Colombian paper was the subject of only preliminary discussion in the UNDC, where a range of different national views were put forward, we believe there is scope for the practical development of the guidelines in the Colombian paper to complement the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the UN Experts Group on government-to-government arms transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such guidelines would, we believe, also complement the existing mechanisms to deal with such clandestine activities, including internal domestic legislation (such as Australia's Customs Act and Regulations), national export controls (such as Australia's `Yellow Book'&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Controls on the Export of Defence and Related Goods</EMPHASIS>, as enforced by the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports&mdash;SIDCE), and, internationally, Interpol procedures and state-to-state or regional cooperation generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. A senior officer from the ANCA's Chief Executive's Office did contact the Big Scrub Environment Centre, seeking information following a call from another non-government conservation group expressing concern about inaccurate material that was being circulated in a newsletter produced by the Big Scrub Environment Centre; this material included misleading references to the role played by the Australian Delegation to the International Whaling Commission (IWC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. When it became clear that the material in question had been accepted in good faith from Ms Sue Arnold as a contributor to the Centre's newsletter, there was some discussion of material that had also been circulated in August 1993 by Ms Sue Arnold, representing Australians for Animals. That earlier material had been of concern because of its inaccuracies and personal attacks on Dr Peter Bridgewater, the Australian Commissioner to the IWC. The ANCA officer mentioned that the Agency had at the time seriously considered seeking legal advice, but that it had been decided not to proceed. There was no suggestion that further legal action was being contemplated and there was no suggestion whatsoever of legal action against the Big Scrub Environment Centre or its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. See (2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The Information Officer agreed to circulate material provided by ANCA as a means of ensuring that those receiving the misinformation in the newsletter had a more accurate understanding of the Government's position. In a very amicable arrangement with the Centre's Information Officer, Ms Lisa Yeates, it was arranged that ANCA would provide material and would pay the additional costs of having it mailed to all of those that had received the earlier newsletter. In addition to a letter from Dr Bridgewater to the Big Scrub Environment Centre, the material included my predecessor's response to Senator Coulter's last question on the Australian Delegation's role in the IWC (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 17 August 1993, response to Question on Notice Number 98) and a copy of the Senate Motion on Whaling of 24 May 1993, recognising the work done by the Australian Government and the Australian Delegation to the IWC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There was no need to do so as the issue had been resolved by the amicable arrangement reached. Copies of all correspondence would have been available to the Management Committee, who have themselves made no further moves to raise the issue directly with ANCA.</PARA>
