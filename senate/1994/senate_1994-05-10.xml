<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I will ask that question again because the minister is supposed to represent the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. The question is: is it the case that widows and divorcees who are in their late 50s will be forced onto the jobsearch allowance and required to look for work while spouses in their early 40s or people with a partner with no recent labour market experience will be eligible for the partner allowance and not required to look for work? There are two groups of people&mdash;women who are older and women who are younger&mdash;who are treated differently. Is that the case under the new arrangements? The answer is yes or no, not some long lecture on choice. If there is a difference between the women in these two different age groups, why do widows have to go out and look for work and why do women with partners not have to go out and look for work under the government's new arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is quite true that there is a difference between women who have a spouse and those who do not. The white paper makes it quite clear, as do the proposed changes in the parenting allowance, that those women will be eligible to go into the work force in their own right. They may have the option of taking the parenting allowance or seeking support through the work force, if that is what they want. Widows are also assisted to go onto unemployment benefits, to assist them to participate in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did note the press statement that was put out by John Anderson. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> accurately noted the other day, the only group that did not welcome the rural initiatives announced in the white paper was the federal opposition. The white paper does include increased funding for rural community access programs, which has been welcomed warmly across the rural community. It does also contain a refocusing of the government's major instrument in the restructuring of rural Australia, the rural adjustment scheme. The RAS refocus will enhance regional adjustment and continue to support individual farmers through training grants and interest subsidies for productivity improvements. The government's substantial support for RAS will be revealed when the budget is brought down tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the senator from the bush would rather have these underspends go back to consolidated revenue instead of being retained in RAS, let him say so. I am negotiating the details of this new approach with the states, which administer the scheme and contribute a minor amount of the funding&mdash;about 10 per cent&mdash;to it. This new approach will also improve the linkages between the rural adjustment scheme and other Commonwealth, state and territory programs, which is a sensible thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the peanut gallery opposite that the suggestion that these changes should be made came to me from farm groups; so, if the honourable senator wants to continue on that course, he may do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a competitive bidding process for funding from the reserve and projects will be developed in full consultation with regional or industry bodies. Mr Anderson queried whether $6 million had been `lopped off' the forward estimates for agribusiness programs in last year's budget. The fact is that a total of just over $13 million will be directly available to agricultural based industries for the purpose of enterprise and export development&mdash;an increase over last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism levelled by Mr Anderson was with regard to the level of CSIRO funding. This is a matter for my colleague Senator Cook, but it does have an important focus in my portfolio because of the agricultural research that is conducted. Mr Anderson focused on a straight comparison of last year's funding with this year's, conveniently forgetting that the last triennium's funding was bolstered by this government by a special supplement of $50 million per year for capital works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the government's consideration of funding for this triennium, and this is the important distinction, was to increase the base level of funding for the science agencies by $34 million a year&mdash;not the generous level of the special supplement that we gave for that triennium but a substantial boost to the historic levels of activity for CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome must also be viewed in the context of the white paper initiative to fund $60 million of national research facility programs over the next eight years and the ongoing support of science agencies by the R&amp;D corporations within the portfolio which, between them, now administer the allocation each year of $250 million worth of research activity. I must say that Mr Anderson's statements in this portfolio, as they were in the previous portfolio, are grossly inaccurate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to his statement yesterday that the migration intake will be increased by 10,000 in the coming year, including an 8,000 increase in the skilled migration category. Last week, at his press club appearance on the white paper, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does Senator Short want an answer? In the same way that Senator Short has quoted from that press statement, he ought to take into consideration precisely what the Prime Minister said. He did not say that there would not be a role; he said that there would be a complementary role for skills coming through. That is on page 4 of the speech at the press club, and it is there very starkly for Senator Short to read.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short has made the mistake&mdash;a mistake made quite commonly on his side of parliament these days&mdash;of not going to sources, not going to the basic source document, but going by some second- or third-hand press report. The Prime Minister always acknowledged a role for migration. What he said was that the major focus of growth through this recession for this government would be the skills formation that we will generate in our response to the white paper. That still stands as the fundamental basis of our response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That acknowledges a complementary role for skills formation and skills development through migration. That is something that this government recognises the need for. I must also say to Senator Short that that is not something that just the broader community recognises a need for; it is something that his purported constituency recognises a need for&mdash;the business community. It, I must say, was at the forefront of asking government to focus on this. I make those two points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, if he looks at the actual document that came out yesterday, Senator Short will see that 8,000 in that so-called skills bracket are people who have been here for four years or so, people who were involved in the 1 November decision last year. They are not just Chinese nationals, but people from some 20 different backgrounds who have been able to access the best and fairest aspect of that 1 November decision. If we deduct those from the increase in the number for the so-called skills category, we come back to a status quo in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say to Senator Short&mdash;and this is something that he really should know because he is the opposition spokesman in this area, and someone who is supposed to have spent some time in researching the area&mdash;when, in migration terms, we talk about the skills category, we are not talking purely about tradespeople. We are not talking purely about electricians or those working in the manufacturing industry&mdash;blue-collar workers. We are talking about&mdash;under the criteria that apply to the skills category and the independent family category&mdash;people who have qualifications of a tertiary nature, or diplomas or the like. People who have those sorts of qualifications must be&mdash;and are&mdash;recognised in Australia within a short period. They are people who, on the whole, are young and have some understanding of English and work experience from six months to three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about direct conflict in the skills category of the migration intake between those sorts of people and the ones that the Prime Minister and the government showed  primary concern for last week. The migration statement announced yesterday is quite complementary to the statement of last week and to the budget as it will be announced tonight. It is a responsible statement. It is a moderate increase, but it is one well in tune with the government's priorities and the priorities of this community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is quite obvious that the minister himself has not read what the Prime Minister said at the press club last week. Let me remind him again that the Prime Minister said that complements to skill formation will come only from our own workforce and people joining our own workforce as new entrants or retraining and replacing them with the long-term unemployed, and that they will not come from migration. Whilst noting the minister's answer, I ask him why the Chinese students were not accommodated within the government's existing skilled component rather than merely added on, given the undertakings that the minister himself gave last year that these people would be accommodated within the existing program. In the context of the Prime Minister's remarks, will this addition for the Chinese students next year be a once off addition, so that the following year's program will be reduced accordingly, or does yesterday's decision constitute a permanent inbuilt uplift in the intake level?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do once again have the basic problem of a supplementary question being written before the answer is given and the questioner goes ahead with it, regardless of the answer. I said to Senator Short in answer to the first question that the beneficiaries of that 1 November decision are not all Chinese students. There are some 20 ethnic communities, 20 nationalities, which are accessing that provision already. We made it very clear on 1 November that the continuing intake will be part of our annual migration program. It is part of our annual migration program. Is it a one-off or not? We also made it very clear last year that it will take a number of years before we finish processing all those people who would be the beneficiaries of that decision. There is nothing new in what I am saying to Senator Short. If he goes back to the debate last year, he will probably find himself in estimates committees saying exactly what I have just said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major initiatives in the industry paper last week was the announcement of a $12 million program of loan funds over four years to the Australian construction industry to form single consortiums from Australia to bid for some of the major infrastructure projects in Asia. We anticipate being able to fund 24 of these consortium bids at about half a million dollars each over the next four years. It will be on a risk sharing basis with the consortium concerned. If the consortium is successful, the public money will be repaid and put back into the fund to pay for further funding or future consortiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We point out that estimates anticipate that until the end of this decade infrastructure projects in Asia will total around $A600 billion, and some people even estimate it going close to $US1 1/2 trillion by the middle of the next decade. So there is to be a major building construction program in that region, probably the biggest in the world's history. Until now, Australian companies have been bidding against each other as well as against companies from overseas, despite the fact that our construction industry is, in most aspects, world best practice, innovative and using the latest technology. But often in these countries we find that if Australian companies are bidding against each other, a company from another country&mdash;a sole bid with the support of the government of that country&mdash;comes through the middle and wins the project. Therefore, we believe that by encouraging consortiums of Australian companies to come together to bid and prepare the feasibility study, we can enhance our chances of winning some of these major projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This consortium idea is not about picking winners. It is an idea that came from the industry itself. Mr Duff, in particular, from Fletcher Construction, prepared a report on this as part of the construction industry reform process over the last two or three years. This is a major initiative that will be advantageous to the Australian construction industry&mdash;an industry that has the potential to earn a lot of export dollars for Australia when it starts winning some of these major contracts that are now available in the region.</PARA>

Senator Kernot may well have a different view of that from what we have, in which case I can respect her view whilst disagreeing with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the main function of the review relates to the collection and collation of data from internal government sources, no particular purpose would be served by establishing an extensive consultation and submissions process. However, the chairperson of the review, Mr Bill Scales, has indicated that he will accept and respond to written input from service users and the community and that such written input will be drawn to the attention of all members of the working party undertaking the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second question, the review has been asked not to concentrate on policy considerations which determine the quality and level of services but, rather, to focus on the cost effectiveness of service delivery in establishing performance indicators for different services which would assist comparisons of efficiency and effectiveness. Such performance indicators will include consideration of program outputs and client outcomes. Accordingly, while it is not intended that the review undertake direct examination of the policies, as I have said, which underpin the service delivery programs, the overall intention of the government is that the review will provide data which will be useful to governments in examining policy options to improve the quality and level of service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the third and last question, at its meeting on 25 February, the Council of Australian Governments received a preliminary report from Mr Scales and called for a further report to its next meeting in August. In addition, the council agreed that the review be asked to give priority to the development of information on educational outputs and outcomes, if appropriate, using the Australian Council for Educational Research, to provide assistance in this area and to provide a report. It was further agreed that, in the light of this report, the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs should provide advice to the council on further action. So, in terms of educational outputs and outcomes, the review is at present examining the areas of schools and vocational training, TAFE, and its work is at a preliminary stage.</PARA>

This is an issue of great significance to a large number of Australians and I hope to get an opportunity to say something about it here. Most senators will have seen media reports concerning the release by my department yesterday of a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United States trade barriers affecting Australian exports</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest edition has been updated to reflect the outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and other recent changes to United States trading policies. We welcome the fact that, as a consequence of those changes, some of the barriers are somewhat lower and some of the access opportunities are slightly enhanced. But it is important to note&mdash;because there has been some international coverage of some of these issues of trade imbalance&mdash;that Australia's trade imbalance with the United States is, in relative terms, bigger than that faced by the United States with Japan. We are trying to say to the United States, `We have a circumstance here where our trade imbalance with you is bigger proportionately than yours with Japan, and yet you have trade barriers to our legitimate export industries and you should be seeking to do something about lowering those restrictions, particularly the severely restricted access for a range of our agricultural exports like beef, dairy products and sugar.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those markets should be more open. We welcome the extent to which they have been opened somewhat more, but they should be opened further; we would then have the opportunity to redress the trade imbalance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The finance minister and I, in my capacity as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, announced a fortnight ago that we would dispose of the remaining public shareholding in the AIDC. That was an in principle announcement. The full scoping study has to be completed by the Department of Finance, and the way in which the disposal will be conducted will, of course, be announced at a later time. But this question is not so much about that. As I understand the question, it is about how the government will deal with the provision of finance to companies that the AIDC may have serviced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have answered this sort of question on several occasions. But I should perhaps reiterate that we believe that the reasons the AIDC was first introduced in 1970 by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McEwen, have been substantially met by the fact that we deregulated the financial markets in 1983. In 1992, as Senator Spindler said, there was a dividend paid to the Commonwealth by the AIDC. But he omitted to say that in 1991 there was a $90 million loss incurred by the AIDC although, to be fair to the institution under its new management, it has certainly been conducting its affairs very well, and one would expect that it will continue to be in profit from now on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether this asset should be retained in public shareholding or is it better able to service the needs of industry if it is in private ownership. The answer to that question is that it can work effectively both ways. But there is no reason why the government should remain as the sole owner of the AIDC, or even as a shareholding owner&mdash;no reason at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change since the Black Jack McEwen days is the deregulation of the financial market and the rise of a number of other companies able to service the same sort of market need that the AIDC was established to service. These include Citibank, Schroders, Bain and Co. and a whole range of other private banks that do this sort of work. Therefore we made a decision, which will be subject to a national conference of the Labor Party on whether policy change will occur, that we would proceed to dispose of the AIDC. It will not affect the provision of finance to the sorts of projects that the AIDC now operates. There is a more competitive market there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The illusion that has been referred to in Senator Spindler's press releases that somehow or other this will deprive small to medium business of access to finance is but that&mdash;an illusion&mdash;because the AIDC operates at the big end of town; it really does not operate in providing funds or support for small to medium enterprises. As Senator Spindler will have seen in the white paper, we have deepened, broadened and enriched the access to finance area for small to medium companies in Australia so that they can have access to equity and developmental finance and venture capital to establish themselves more effectively.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite can talk about majorities, but the facts are that the quality of care is what is most important, according to these reports. The research from Gai Ochiltree has examined 40 years of child-care research documents. It shows that the most important factor is the quality of care, whether that is care provided at home or at child-care establishments. That is why, in recognition of that, I find the Australian Institute of Family Studies report very important because it supports so well the accreditation program we have introduced into child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to note the importance of that accreditation program, particularly in the light of the nonsense that went on in this place about whether or not we should introduce it. It is the quality of care&mdash;whether it is provided by the parent or in the child-care centres&mdash;that makes the difference. It is very important in our policies that we support and promote choice for parents. We do not support judgment&mdash;judging whether people who make choices are right or wrong. That is what the opposition is doing, and that is what the Australian Family Association is doing. It says that parents who make certain choices are bad, and that they are bad because they are abandoning their children to less than good care. This research shows that that is not the case. I certainly suggest that the opposition would be much better off supporting parents in making those choices and supporting quality of care&mdash;both at home and in the child-care arrangements&mdash;than by damning parents and condemning them.</PARA>

A selective tendering process, in accordance with current purchasing guidelines, began in November 1993.

Ryebuck Media is an independent educational media company based in Melbourne, which has twice won competitive tenders to produce videos for the Parliamentary Education Office. The NRS Group is a private Canberra firm.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the white paper employment strategy, it is intended to encourage women under 40 with no dependent children and older women with recent work force experience to remain in or re-enter the work force. That is because the work force experience of these women is likely to be much more substantial than for older women or those with children. The activity test will not be applied to women over 40 at 1 July 1995 unless they have had recent work force experience. In 1987, the government decided to phase out the widow B pension, and at the time the opposition supported that change. However, I understand that the Minister for Social Security is now looking at the circumstances of older women affected by the phasing out of widows B pension.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to the application of the Jobsearch allowance to women.</PARA>
<PARA>The question I asked Senator Crowley was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it the case that, under the white paper social security arrangements, widows and divorcees aged in their late 50s will be forced onto the jobsearch allowance and required to look for work, while spouses in their early 40s with no recent labour market experience will be eligible for the partner allowance and not required to look for work?</PARA>
<PARA>She could not answer that question. In this chamber she represents the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Dr Lawrence) and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), so I would have expected her to have known the answer to that question. We on this side know that in 1987 the government put into force legislation which meant that over time the widow B pension would be phased out. Senator Crowley reminded us that the coalition supported that legislation. However, I remind people that those opposite are in government. At the time, Mr James Porter, the then shadow minister for social security, in his speech at the second reading stage of that bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, the Government is acting against the woman who marries young, raises her children and stays at home to care for those children. Once the mother reaches the age of 50 or 55 and has little or no income&mdash;her children have grown older and her husband has died&mdash;the Government says that she should not receive a pension. She is expected to go back into the work force. Of course, she will have few skills to enable her to go back into the work force and, if she does not, she will have to go on to the dole.</PARA>
<PARA>We expressed concern at that time. Now the situation is that, with the phasing-in, as of 1994, a 58-year-old widow will have to go on a jobsearch allowance and be involved in the activity work test and all that being on the jobsearch allowance involves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the new white paper, women who have a partner, either a spouse or a de facto, who are over 40 and who have not been in the work force or not had recent labour market experience will be eligible to take a partner allowance which would entitle them to $265.30 paid fortnightly. A widow or divorcee in her middle to late 50s who is on the widows B pension and who is in the same situation of not having any recent work force experience will receive $294.10 a fortnight and be on JSA, with no partner or spouse to assist her. Compare that with a younger woman in exactly the same situation&mdash;no recent work force experience but with a partner, a de facto or spouse&mdash;who will get $265.30 a fortnight. That is the issue I want clarified, because the documents are so detailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the minister justify that significant discrimination against a woman who, through no fault of her own, has lost a spouse who has died? While the minister was on her feet, she was unable to explain why this anomaly exists. I found it amazing that she had to spend the whole of question time on the phone to find out what I thought she would have known&mdash;that widows with no recent experience in the work force now have to be involved in work activities under the jobsearch allowance and yet a woman who choses the partner allowance&mdash;she can choose JSA, as we read in the document; I do not know whether Senator Crowley would have been able to tell us that without briefing&mdash;gets a little under $30 a fortnight less than a widow gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know why the government did that. Why has the government got this complete anomaly? A woman in her early 40s is more likely to be able to find employment if she has been out of the work force for a while than a woman in her mid to late 50s. Surely the minister can understand that. I hope the Minister for Social Security addresses it soon because there is a grave anomaly here and the government should look into it immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not critical of the government's white paper in this particular respect. However, I have some problems when it relates to the income of single income families. I agree with Senator Patterson about this question of the widow's pension. I opposed the legislation in 1987. On 23 November last year I asked a question of the minister representing the Minister for Social Security, and I referred to a particular widow in my constituency of Tasmania. That lady is 50 years of age and was recently widowed after 33 years of marriage. She nursed her mother, father-in-law and husband through their terminal illnesses. She has raised four children and has 11 grandchildren and is currently involved in community work. The Minister for Family Services talks about choice. Fourteen weeks after this woman's husband died she was forced out into the paid work force. She had no choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government repudiated what she had done for her own family and what she had saved this government. The government denied her the status of widowhood because it had introduced legislation which cancelled the widow's pension for her. For century after century widowhood has been a status which has been recognised by the community. But the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Crowley, does not recognise that status for the first time in centuries. This government is not providing a choice for this woman or for thousands like her&mdash;and not only women in their early 50s but, as Senator Patterson said, in their middle to late 50s. The government is not giving these women any choice; it is forcing them into the paid work force. The government is forcing these women to compete for jobs with their own sons and daughters. Is that sensible? Is that fair? Is that just? It is crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the Minister for Social Security had a look at this. In answer to my question the minister said that the government would have a look at it. Then I received a response from Mr Baldwin emphasising that the government would have a look at it. Nothing has happened. The Minister for Family Services comes in here and in a supplementary statement says that the government is going to have a look at it. It is about time that the government had a look at it and restored that status to women. They should at least be given a choice. If they choose to go on JSA, allow them to go on JSA. If they choose to retain the status of widowhood for the purposes of the widow's pension, the government should restore that which it has taken from them. Women are very disappointed. I have had letter after letter from widows who are very concerned about this matter, and they feel cheated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about what Ben Chifley did. I suppose I have had more experience of the Labor movement than almost anybody in this chamber and know a bit about what Ben Chifley said and did. I remind the chamber that it was Ben Chifley who, as Treasurer in the Curtin government in 1942, introduced the widow's pension. It is this government which has taken it away. I now appeal to the government to restore it in order to give dignity, choice and status once again to the widows of Australia. </PARA>

The parenting allowance is at a maximum of nearly $130 per week and will be paid to one partner of an unemployed couple where there are dependent children under 16 years of age. Partners in low income families will receive on average a $59 per week parenting allowance. This will be combined with the home care child allowance to ensure that families with one partner out of the work force catering for children will receive at least $30 a week irrespective of family income. Essentially this is to deal with a growing problem that is being created by an ongoing situation of long-term unemployment of both partners within a family.

<PARA>The case of a Northern Territory union leader facing four allegations of sexual harassment is nothing short of a scandal in the way in which it has been handled by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Darwin. The four cases, comprising two official complaints and two written statements to the commission, make serious allegations against Mr Hugh Crawford. Mr Crawford is the president of the Northern Territory Trades and Labor Council. He also works as an organiser for the Automotive, Food, Engineering and Metal Workers Union in Darwin. It is important to point out that Mr Crawford emphatically denies any allegation of impropriety and intends to defend his name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to raise this matter publicly was made by one of the women involved. She is so concerned about her welfare and safety that she specifically requested that it be raised in federal parliament. She believes that the publicity will protect her and her family. Two of the women making allegations are members of the Australian Services Union. Earlier this year the branch secretary of that union, Mr John Gazzola, wrote several letters on their behalf. The first letter, on 8 February 1994, was addressed to Ms Jill Huck of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Darwin. I refer to the following three quotes. In the second paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Union writes officially to inform you that our NT Representative, Lucio, and our member, Dianna Lothian, are concerned about their welfare and safety. The ASU is also concerned for their welfare and safety.</PARA>
<PARA>In the third paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lucio has been receiving nuisance calls at his home and our member Dianna Lothian has informed the Union that she has received calls asking for her to drop her case or an accident may happen to her children.</PARA>
<PARA>In the final paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are extremely concerned for the welfare of Lucio Matarazzo, and our member Dianna Lothian.</PARA>
<PARA>The second letter dated 25 February 1994, again to Ms Huck, pleads for hearing dates to be set as soon as possible. Mr Gazzola highlights the urgency of the case, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commission must recognise that while the matter remains unheard it is having a detrimental effect on the health and welfare of those involved.</PARA>
<PARA>The third letter of 27 April 1994 to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner in Sydney again pleads for the complaints to be heard at the earliest opportunity. In this letter Mr Gazzola expresses concern that the Northern Territory regional director of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Ms Jill Huck, is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">currently considering whether to exercise her power to decline the complaint&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He also notes that Ms Huck failed to reply to his letters. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 11 April this year reported the resignation of a female trade union leader in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently Ms Cathy Richardson, the technical branch president of the Automotive, Food, Engineering and Metal Workers Union, resigned in protest at her union's federal executive which had decided not to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against Mr Crawford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She added that she was `unhappy and disillusioned' and that the union's federal secretary, Mr George Campbell, had ignored human rights guidelines and compromised union efforts to negotiate grievance procedures with employers in cases of sexual harassment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To see absolutely nothing being done by an employer, which in this case happens to be a trade union, makes me wonder what chance we have in dealing with other employers.</PARA>

I might do that firstly by bringing to the Senate's attention a letter I received from Mr Walker, the Minister for Administrative Services, after, I think, the time that order expired. In that letter, which is addressed to me, Mr Walker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that you moved a motion in the Senate this morning seeking information about lease arrangements for three DAS businesses at Casselden Place in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know I provided to Senator McMullan a letter outlining my reasons for not agreeing to provide the information you requested.</PARA>
<PARA>He then reiterates his reasons in brief. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I gather that you may not have had adequate time to appreciate the points made in my letter before you moved your motion. I should therefore like to reaffirm the offer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so forth. The offer was to provide some general details about rent levels in these buildings and to provide them on a confidential basis. I wrote back to Mr Walker basically saying that the Senate had been made aware of the contents of the letter to Senator McMullan. Indeed, Senator McMullan I think read the letter to the chamber during that debate and tabled the letter. I know that, from speaking to, particularly, Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats, he was well aware of the contents of the letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite politely informed Mr Walker, with a copy to Senator McMullan, that the contents of his letter were well and truly understood by the Senate and that the Senate had passed that motion requiring the documents to be tabled in full knowledge of the offer that had been made. I also reminded the minister that the Senate's resolution had been breached. One of the sad facts of this is that there has been absolutely no communication from either Senator McMullan or Mr Walker in all of that time that has passed since then. I actually went through the process of giving notice of this censure motion yesterday to allow some fundamental courtesies or sensible discussion to take place between the giving of notice yesterday and the actual moving of the censure today. However, none of that has occurred, and I suppose there may be reasons for that which I do not understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quickly touch on the principles that I think are important here. We have, with the commercialisation of DAAS businesses and other entities of the Commonwealth government, created a conflict of principle&mdash;I think as Senator McMullan calls it&mdash;in allowing these government owned and operated service entities to compete in the marketplace fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a genuine concern where we find the parliament having the power to ask those enterprises to table information, which may be of a commercial nature, that may or may not prejudice their operations in the marketplace. We then have the competing principle of the parliament having the right to know about&mdash;indeed, the responsibility to oversee&mdash;these operations to ensure that the taxpayers' money is being spent wisely and to ensure that they are properly accountable. It is quite an important responsibility, and one that cannot just be thrown away because these enterprises have moved into a commercial sphere of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the need to move return to order processes here in the last few months. The first was in relation to a question about Centenary House where I had a similar answer from Senator McMullan saying that some information that I had requested was commercial-in-confidence. I had to use the return to order process because I could not get the information out of the minister. We heard the very same arguments that Senator McMullan put up last week in relation to that return to order&mdash;that it would be commercially in confidence and would prejudice things and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator McMullan actually complied with the order of the Senate on that occasion, the information that was provided totally supported all of the doubts I had about it. I will remind the Senate that that was to seek information to prove that the Australian National Audit Office was actually paying to the Australian Labor Party at Centenary House the highest net effective rental negotiated anywhere in Australia at the time. Senator Murphy will remember this vaguely. I actually put it to the Australian Property Group at an estimates committee that it should find me evidence of any lease negotiated anywhere in Australia in the last two years that was higher than Centenary House. I said, `If you say that Centenary House isn't the highest rental&mdash;'</PARA>

When the information was finally provided to me using a return to order it showed that the rentals that had been provided which, prima facie, looked higher than Centenary House were rentals for properties negotiated for a 10-year period with absolutely fixed rents&mdash;no increases, no nothing. In other words, rents negotiated in 1993, 1994 or whenever it was, fixed for the next 10 years. Basically, we had been misled by both the minister and the Australian Property Group. That made me extremely cynical about any assurance given to me by this minister and this government in relation to commercial confidentiality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next occasion was in relation to the Dasfleet car leases to the Transport Workers Union. On that occasion I had an offer to go to the minister's office, look at the agreement and get certain details. I accepted that offer very reluctantly on the basis that if I discovered that something was wrong, or that there had been a commercial subsidy or that the leases were not commercial, then I would have the opportunity to make those things public. I found some leases&mdash;Senator McMullan and I could have a debate about this for hours, but I do not seek to re-run that debate&mdash;that were grossly uncommercial, even to the extent that after assurances that commercial people leasing cars from Dasfleet paid sales tax, we uncovered the fact that they did not pay sales tax and would have to repay a quarter of a million dollars worth of sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that one of the offers we have had in relation to this is for me to go and have a confidential look at some documents again. The problem with that is that if I take up the offer, have a confidential look and am not satisfied by what I see, what do I do? If I come back here and say, `I have just discovered some major fraud,' or, `I have discovered a major maladministration,' Senator McMullan would put out press releases saying, `Senator Campbell has rorted the truth again.' I would be putting myself in an invidious position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important principle that we are discussing and having confidential briefings in the minister's office is not the way to solve it. In the end, the Senate has got to make a sensible decision about the balance between accountability and the commercial interests of these commercialised bodies. If one is forced to make a decision as to where commercial interest or accountability lies, then any doubt should fall on the side of the accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here specifically with Casselden Place. The Commonwealth government built a building and leased it to a number of its agencies. I have severe doubts about how the government is using its money and managing its property in relation to leases to three of the agencies involved. Those three Commonwealth entities are: Interiors Australia; Australian Construction Services, which at the time the agreements were entered into was known as Projects; and Asset Services. All of them have entered into agreements. I believe that those agreements were initially entered into in about 1988 but, according to the minister's answer, the tenancies did not start until 1 December 1992. We found out subsequently that these new tenancy agreements commencing in 1992 received from the property adjustment scheme upwards of $1.5 million in rental subsidies. We need to know all the information about these leases because, effectively, the property adjustment program was designed to help the transition of departmental agencies into their new commercialised environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand now, because I have had leaked to me the second part of a draft. I received an anonymous letter yesterday, obviously from someone in DAS, telling me some of the background. It would have been quite helpful if it had been provided to the Senate, because it actually goes to the reasons why the property adjustment program came into place. The government, at least in this answer from the minister&mdash;which he did not agree with because he obviously crossed it out and did not want it given to me, but someone else did&mdash;basically says that the tenancy agreements were entered into in 1988. I presume they were agreements entered into prior to the construction of the building. That is possibly a reasonable explanation as to why the property adjustment program is being used in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate needs to know all this information. We need to know whether the rents are fair; we need to know why the property adjustment program was used; we need to know what rents are being paid; we need to know how the outgoings in the building are being charged to the various bodies; and we need to know the details about any incentives or additional assistance that these bodies were given in moving into the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not reflect only on the entities that have moved into the building, it reflects also on the ownership of the building and the way that government property is being managed. If everything that I know is true, then the government is using all sorts of double accounting to make it look as though it is running its properties efficiently when it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I am falling into my own trap of arguing the case about the building and why I need to know the information. That, of course, is not the subject of this censure motion. The subject of the censure motion is that the minister has breached an order of the Senate. That is a serious offence. The Senate considered the points I put to it last week and made the decision to order the minister to table documents. The minister has breached that without any apology or explanation and without even seeking to have discussions, and that requires censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate loses its power to compel the executive to table these sorts of documents then we may as well go home. The Senate should consider this breach by the minister representing Mr Walker and Mr Walker himself and, equally compelling in considering whether to censure these ministers,  is Mr Walker's most arrogant assumption that the Senate misunderstood him and therefore passed the motion without properly considering his information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The one thing I agree with Senator Campbell about in his contribution is that this is a debate about conflicting principles and a difficult balance of principles that we have had several times before. I do not agree with what he said about the previous occasions but he has outlined the previous occasions on which we have had it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other thing that we also need to note which is that in recent times the Senate has taken to distributing censure motions rather like confetti. There was a time when they were very important, weighty matters which needed to be taken with extreme concern, because this was a product of the due deliberation of the majority of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell correctly said, this has always been a political chamber and there have always been political decisions, but I think in recent years the decisions have got more frequent, less relevant and more political. We now really have a process where, overlying a legitimate disagreement of principle, about which I wish to give my principal concern, we have a body of people making its political way by pursuing these issues here in the Senate in a very resolute and divisive way, and not accepting any reasonable alternative proposal that is put forward and continually raising these sorts of issues in the way that Senator Campbell does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he entirely misrepresents Mr Walker's intention in this matter, and I want to deal with that in the main. For ministers representing other ministers it is always a difficult situation to be required to present things which are not in their possession and then to be censured for not presenting them when they do not have them. I am not seeking to distance myself one iota from Mr Walker, and I will not. I am simply saying that we have a rather bizarre element to all this which needs to be taken into account. In the past when these matters came up they related to me in my capacity as minister directly, so that extra complication did not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a delicate question for the Senate to consider&mdash;not for the first time requiring a balance of judgment about conflicting worthy motives. There is no question that the issue of the Senate's and the parliament's right to receive information about the expenditure of public money is important. I have never challenged that. I think all the indications on the public record of things I have said and things I have sought to do would confirm that I regard that issue of accountability for expenditure of taxpayers' money to be an issue of great importance. But here we have a situation not where we are requiring to keep the information confidential from interested senators&mdash;the minister has said, `If you want to come and look at this information I will make it available'&mdash;but where we are trying to keep it confidential from the competitors of these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no Chinese wall that says, `We can make this information available publicly but not to the competitors of the businesses to whom it relates.' That is not possible. The public is comprised of, amongst others, the people who are the competitors of these businesses. So we cannot say, `It is all right, we will make it available only to the Senate,' because if it is made available in the normal way it becomes public and becomes available to the competitors of these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a lot of talk in this place about competitive neutrality and about creating a circumstance in which there is no special advantage to public sector organisations now that we have required them to get out there and compete. I support sending them out there to compete. I have advocated it, and I have done a substantial amount about it. I accept that there is an inherent disadvantage&mdash;which Senator Campbell does not accept&mdash;on public sector enterprises because they have a greater obligation of disclosure and of accountability, and it costs them money to comply with that. It means that some of their results are published in a way that their competitors' results are not, and information about their operations is available in a way that information about their competitors is not. I accept that. But that does not mean that everything that gives them a disadvantage, every bit of lead that we can put in their saddlebags, should be placed there. We have to exercise a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most senators, and certainly the government, the minor parties and Senator Harradine, accept the legitimate role of public sector enterprises in our economy. I have heard them speak about it in different circumstances&mdash;not about these particular enterprises, but conceptually about the legitimate role of publicly-owned enterprises. Some senators have been passionate in their advocacy&mdash;as was implicit, for example, in the question from Senator Spindler today&mdash;and some of them at least are defending the right of public sector enterprises to exist and compete effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have it both ways. If we say, `We stand as people who, in a mixed economy, defend the legitimate right of the public sector' it does not mean that everything that is ever in public ownership has to stay there. If it did, we would still have government-owned butcher shops and hotels like we did in the 1920s, when they were needed. But there are enterprises operating in a particularly difficult context, which is within a departmental structure and not as separate corporate entities, where some of the accountability questions are still difficult&mdash;I instance the Telecoms and the statutory corporations&mdash;but where, nevertheless, the framework is more clearly established. Certainly, some of these enterprises&mdash;particularly Interiors, which is one of those in question&mdash;are very small enterprises. It is hard to envisage that the Commonwealth would spin off a public sector corporation of the size of a little outfit like Interiors, which is an interior decorating and design business. Some senators would be aware of it because one of the things it does, in competition with the private sector, is the layout of many senators' and members' offices. Such enterprises operate within a departmental framework and so have extra burdens of accountability and of disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we are saying, `You have entered into a contract that is a significant part of the cost of running your business. All the business you get you have to get by tender. You have to get it by putting in competitive bids. But everybody who is going to bid against you already knows the wage rates of your staff because that is public.' That is a disadvantage these enterprises have. The competitors already know that. They know the numbers of their staff because that is disclosed and that is a disadvantage they have compared to the others because that is all published. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily. Then we say, `Now they are going to know essentially the last key element of your cost structure, which is the cost of the property in which you house yourself.' For a body like Interiors, that is essentially what it costs to run the business&mdash;the cost of employing people and the cost of renting the space for them. There really are not any other costs. There is probably a little bit of technology. If one wanted to check, one could probably find what that cost, too, but it is a tiny amount for an organisation like that. We say, `Everybody knows your cost structure on which you are tendering, but you do not know anything about that of your competitors.' On the one hand, we say, `We are advocates of your cause. We think the public sector enterprise has a legitimate right to participate out there competitively in a difficult, competitive environment, but you have to have this extra element of lead in your saddlebags.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that such enterprises are entitled to commit some sort of fraud upon the public or default on the taxpayers' money or whatever, but none of that is in question; it is not even alleged. Of course, all of these public enterprises are audited by the audit office every year. They are also entitled to have a legitimate review about how they are managing the taxpayers' money, how the people who own the property they are renting and they are managing the taxpayers' money; but that is all disclosed. The return that those companies make is reported every year; it goes to an estimates committee every year. They are asked, `Did you make a profit? Did you make a loss?' All that is known. The balance of all their activities is reflected in the report that Interiors or ACS or Assets might make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the obligation of the executive, when it is in conflict with the legislature about the provision of information&mdash;where we say that this is not an appropriate occasion for the exercise of the legislature's powers of seeking information&mdash;is to seek to make as much of the information as possible available in an alternative way. We are not in the business of covering up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Walker has sought to do that. He wrote, effectively, to the Senate. He wrote a letter to me which, as all honourable senators know, I tabled in the Senate. That obviously was not sufficient because the Senate still carried a resolution, so he wrote another letter to Senator Campbell. It is true that he has not written any more&mdash;he has written only twice&mdash;but I think that is because those letters constitute, in effect, with the comments I made last time, the outline of the government's case. We could reiterate it as often as those opposite would prefer, but that remains the essence of our position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a difficult position. The executive is saying to interested members of the legislature, interested senators, but applying to members of the House of Representatives if they chose to exercise it, `We will seek to make as much of this information available to you as possible, provided we can do it in a way that does not also make it available to all the competitors of these enterprises.' If those opposite want to put forward an alternative proposal about the way in which they would like this information made available so that they can have access to it and check whether some unreasonable course of action is being undertaken, but in a manner that does not make the information available to the competitors of those businesses, I am sure Mr Walker will take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has not been such a proposal and I have not discussed with Mr Walker what it might be because I cannot think of one that goes beyond that which we have already offered to Senator Campbell and which is implicitly available to all honourable senators. We made it explicitly available to Senator Campbell because he is the one who has asked, but it is obviously equally available to others. So that is the balance. We are trying in good faith to say that we do have a dilemma; we are seeking a way to resolve that dilemma by saying we will make the information available to any interested member of the Senate or the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr Walker feels very strongly that we need to defend the legitimate interests of the people who manage and work in these enterprises. In the case of Interiors we are talking about a very small number, but in the case of the three enterprises altogether we are talking more than 1,000 Australian people out there trying to compete in a tough environment where at least one territory government refuses to allow them to tender on the grounds of sheer prejudice. It jeopardises the employment opportunities of all those workers because that government is prejudiced against them because they work for the Commonwealth government. They are fighting in a difficult environment and we are trying to defend their interests but in a way that we can go as far as we can in meeting the legitimate requests and desires of the Senate and senators. We will go as far as we can in seeking to do that. </PARA>

I do not know his views on the particulars until we hear what they are; but I can say that I know that we would be open to a suggestion. Both of us&mdash;him directly, me indirectly through him&mdash;are being put in an extremely difficult position because we have both been involved with the political process. Mr Walker has been involved in the parliamentary process for a very long time, both in government and in opposition. We both respect the legitimate rights of the parliament in a democracy and we do not want to be seen to be in conflict with that. But we do have the interests of 1,000 and more Commonwealth employees to protect and we intend to do that to the best of our ability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting this censure motion. The central issue before the Senate today is that the Senate passed a motion requesting a minister to provide certain information. That motion was passed by a majority of the Senate after due deliberation and after consideration of a letter tabled by Senator McMullan representing the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker. However, it is inevitable that in dealing with that, one also has to advert to some of the substantive details before the Senate. But it is basically a matter of process and procedure and the view that the Senate takes, and should take, of the refusal of a minister to comply with a resolution of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also received a letter from Mr Walker after the Senate motion was passed. I was, of course, aware during the debate of the letter that Senator McMullan had tabled. I looked at that letter and considered it very carefully, yet still voted for the motion that Senator Campbell put before the Senate. On balance, I came to the view that the Senate should, in this instance, receive all the details required and that public accountability overrode some of the other considerations which I acknowledged in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did make the decision on balance. I did say that there were competing principles and that there was an element of commercial confidentiality involved. In particular, I believed it was in the area of not prejudicing the leasing of remaining vacant tenancies in the building to other tenants, but I took the view, again on balance, that 87 per cent completely and legally let office space constituted substantial letting of the building in the current property market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Walker fastened on to those comments. He wrote me a letter saying that he thought we might be at cross-purposes and that if I considered that an element of commercial confidentiality was involved, he would like to pursue it further with me. He advised me that it was possible that further vacancies in the building would occur and that more than the 13 per cent of office space might have to be negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that that substantially detracts from the balance question and from the decision I made. I do not quite know why Mr Walker thought that it should. He was faced with a resolution of the Senate, made by a majority after consideration and I do not see how our parliamentary system can work if, once a resolution like that is passed, the responsible minister simply says, `I don't agree with you. I'll continue to argue the point.' I do not think we can accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter that he raised that Senator McMullan today pursued in quite some detail is the commercial disadvantage we would saddle the three government owned businesses with if their rents became public knowledge. That is a furphy and a nonsense, and I can address that with some commercial background. In fact, to Senator McMullan's probable discomfort, I can advise him that I ran a business which included providing interior design and decoration advice and sale of furniture, as well as wall-hangings, paint et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not have cared a hoot if my competitors knew my rent outgoings in any business. Perhaps I should not draw the bow quite as widely as that. In a business of the type we are discussing the rent is a fairly minor cost item. I would estimate it to be between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the total cost of the enterprise. By far the greatest cost is the personnel that one employs, and the minister acknowledges that. Anyone who is interested in working out, for competition purposes, what it costs a competitor to run a business would have to put a figure against rent&mdash;whether one owned the building and therefore had to meet the interest payments, notionally or actually, on the capital invested in owning the building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that once we have done that, we also know what the approximate market figure is if we are paying a rental. If we guess perhaps 10 per cent or 15 per cent, our competitor has an advantage in knowing the actual figure, but it can only be a marginal advantage. It may be a one per cent, a two per cent or a three per cent differential. Translating that against the magnitude of the total expenditure, the variation in the cost of rent is extremely marginal if we consider all the other factors that go into making our decision as to the tender price that we submit. We might make a decision that in this instance we want to accept a loss because we want to gain a client. That might make a difference of five, 10 or 20 per cent in our tender price. We might be using a material that we have access to which once again has a large variation as a cost factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To argue that any of these businesses would be severely disadvantaged in the marketplace because the exact rental that they are paying could become known to their competitors is really a furphy. I simply cannot accept that. The requirement for the Senate to be informed in detail of the expenditure incurred on behalf of taxpayers, and of the considerations that went into using some PAP funds, far outweighs that particular consideration which I believe would be a very minimal one indeed. I believe that the minister's obligation to provide information to the Senate following a resolution of the Senate requiring him to do so far outweighs any other possible consideration. I think Mr Walker's attempt to continue to negotiate after the decision of the Senate has been made is reprehensible. The Australian Democrats support the motion moved by Senator Campbell. </PARA>

We support it in principle as part of a series of incidents which illustrates this government's and this minister's disrespect of the Senate by breaching an order of the Senate. The Greens are not necessarily aware of all the facts underlying Senator Campbell's request&mdash;though I must add that he has tried to keep us informed. It is not one where we are involved with the issue. However, we respect his right to request that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware of the conflicting principles and that there is a difficulty between commercial confidentiality and the parliament's obligation to be accountable on the expenditure of taxpayers' money. I believe that Senator Spindler has commented adequately on that. I want to comment on Senator McMullan statements where he said that there was a time when an order of the Senate was dealt with as a weighty matter but of late&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. He said that they were dealt with as a weighty matter, and he said that as of late these have been so like confetti that they are in danger of being devalued. I consider that as being of very great concern. Senator McMullan's remarks implied that the withholding of cooperation by the government is an exception rather than the rule. So I am very interested to find out when and on how many occasions the government has demonstrated its compliance with an order of the Senate. I will endeavour to look at that further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator McMullan is right when he says that generally in the past returns to order have received respect and that there has been only a handful of occasions on which they may have been ignored or some delay may have occurred between the request and the tabling of the documents that have been requested. The one that stands out in my mind was a letter between two ministers concerning woodchip export licences. A request was made on 16 December, the document was not tabled and the minister was censured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this trend towards non-compliance with requests for tabling by the Senate is very damaging. I believe that the principle of censuring a minister may be also treated more lightly than in the past. On the basis that this is a matter of principle and seriousness, and on the basis of accountability and the need for the government to be transparent in its dealings, the Greens indicate our support for the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for too long because Senator Spindler responded to some of the issues that Senator McMullan raised. Senator Spindler successfully knocked over that argument about the value of information to competitors. Senator Spindler accurately made the point that competitors in the interior design business, the asset services business and the construction industry would not even bother pulling out the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to try to find out this information. It is of no consequence whatsoever to competitors. It was a stupid argument, which was successfully knocked over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to respond to two points. Firstly, Senator McMullan made a point about competitive neutrality. Just before the COAG meeting Senator McMullan quoted from the Hilmer report on national competition policy. What Senator McMullan quoted from the Hilmer report on that day was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage by virtue of their ownership when competing with other businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very important principle. The principle we are dealing with here today is who is going to be the judge of whether or not there is compliance. In some circumstances it can be the Auditor-General, but usually that is long after some breach has taken place. In many circumstances it will fall to the accountability and scrutiny of the parliament to be the judge. That is why this return to order is crucial and why the enforcement of that return to order by the Senate through censure is also crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to respond to is this business of information about rents, wages and all other factors being available through the accountability procedures that we have with reporting of these Commonwealth agencies and departments. The figures for many of these things are reported on a global basis, such as rents and the number of man hours and so forth across Australia. The minister is asking us to accept that information. However, if we are looking for mismanagement, fraud, or any other contravention of good management practice in the public sector, mismanagement can be covered up in any area of any agency in any city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have asset services and construction services in Melbourne, Sydney or Perth making an absolute hash of the job&mdash;and I am not suggesting that for a moment&mdash;but because of the way things are reported we do not see it. The minister is saying that we cannot ask questions about it and we cannot get the information to make those judgments. For the sake of the taxpayers of Australia, I genuinely hope that my concerns about what is happening with the management of Casselden Place and the administration of the property adjustment program are wrong. But the Senate will never know unless the executive of this government&mdash;including this minister who is personally responsible as he is the one upon whom the order was made&mdash;complies with the order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that censure motions are being thrown around like confetti. I do not perceive that to be the case but, if it is true, it is because senators are making the decision more often that ministers are thumbing their noses at the Senate and the parliament. If it is the case that the Senate needs to censure ministers for these breaches, then so be it. It is something that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Certainly this matter should be taken seriously. In a political sense the Democrats and the Greens and a number of senators around the chamber have very different concepts from mine about the role of the federal government being in business. Ideologically they see a bigger role than I do for government in running businesses and being involved in these sorts of things. It is no easy matter for me to convince my colleagues on the cross benches of my need to get this information. They have come to that decision, which I respect, and I thank them for their support on this important principle when a minister has chosen, quite wilfully and unapologetically, flagrantly to breach an order of the Senate. I urge Senate support for this censure motion against the ministers concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the President of the Republic of South Africa marks nothing less than the birth of a new nation&mdash;a nation where the scourge of apartheid has been once and for all abolished; a nation where every citizen, whatever his or her race, has equal worth and an equal right to shape the country's future; a South Africa free at last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is deservedly a day of triumph for Nelson Mandela himself. His election as President; the swearing-in of the wholly non-racial parliament in which the ANC is the clear majority party; and the installation of a government of national unity reflecting not only the ANC but all major streams of opinion in the parliament, are triumphant realisations of the vision and the ideas he has held, and the principles for which he has fought, for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nelson Mandela showed in his trial 30 years ago, throughout his 27 years of incarceration, and in the four years since his release, true leadership: a noble vision of justice and equality for all; single-minded determination and total commitment; toughness in negotiations, combined with constant readiness to hold out the hand of friendship; and great personal courage&mdash;all combined with an extraordinary personal dignity and an almost awesome absence of personal bitterness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is also a day to honour those other South Africans who fought so long and hard for so many years to bring it about&mdash;those who in many cases, in long and lonely years in gaol or in other ways, suffered as grievously as Nelson Mandela himself; those who in many cases have not, unhappily, survived to savour the triumph. We remember on this occasion people like Steve Biko, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Helen Suzman, Helen Joseph, Desmond Tutu and all those others who have spent their lives, or given their lives, in working to bring dignity to oppressed and disadvantaged South Africans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today is also a day to particularly honour former President F W de Klerk, who had the courage to make the break with the past and who, despite virulent opposition from those who had most to lose by the destruction of apartheid, steadfastly refused to be deflected from the path to non-racial democracy. We admire the grace with which, in conceding defeat in the election, Mr de Klerk pledged not only his cooperation but his friendship to Nelson Mandela. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, today is also a day to record the satisfaction which Australians can reasonably feel at the role that our country played in bringing about the new South Africa. Of course, we were never alone in this respect in the international community. But it was the Commonwealth that provided much of the moral and political leadership for the international anti-apartheid movement for many years, and within the Commonwealth it was Australia&mdash;at least from the early 1970s on&mdash;which played a particularly prominent role, along with, especially, India, Canada, Malaysia and the front-line African states, in giving political and intellectual leadership to that movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition to apartheid has been a bipartisan matter in Australia for many years. It is, therefore, especially appropriate, given the major role which was played by each of their governments, that both Mr Fraser and Mr Hawke should be today representing Australia at the inauguration of President Mandela. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sanctions against South Africa have a long history, going back to India's trade ban in 1946. Australia first played a role in this respect when Gough Whitlam announced in December 1972 that sporting teams selected on the basis of race would not be allowed to enter Australia. That sports boycott, strengthened subsequently in 1977 by the Fraser government following Gleneagles and in 1983 by the Hawke government, made&mdash;it is now generally acknowledged&mdash;a crucial psychological contribution to the change process, by driving home year after year to the sports-mad white South African community just how internationally despised and isolated their country had become as a result of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Australia played a leading role in instituting the trade and investment sanctions agreed at the Nassau Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1985. The first tranche, imposed immediately, included bans on new government loans to the South African government, on the import of krugerrands, on government funding for trade promotion, on the export of computer equipment and on the sale of oil. The second tranche, imposed following the mission to South Africa of the Eminent Persons Group in 1986 which was co-led by Malcolm Fraser, included bans on air links with South Africa, on the import of agricultural products, on new investment or the reinvestment of profits earned in South Africa, and on government procurement from South African sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1987 on, attention turned primarily to financial sanctions&mdash;the denial or limitation of credit to South African government agencies or companies by other governments and by the private banking sector internationally. It was Prime Minister Bob Hawke at the Vancouver CHOGM in 1987 who initiated the ground-breaking expert study on the impact of financial sanctions which became widely influential in international financial circles, and which subsequently influenced a wider global public still to understand the centrality of these sanctions when it was published&mdash;again at Australian initiative&mdash;in 1989 as the Penguin book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Apartheid and International Finance</EMPHASIS>, by Keith Ovenden and Tony Cole. Ultimately it was financial sanctions, more than anything else, that drove the South African government to the negotiating table&mdash;and this has been frankly acknowledged by South African ministers and officials on many occasions over the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since President de Klerk's historic speech on 2 February 1990 launching the reform process, Australia has continued to be active in supporting the movement to full democracy, right through until last month's elections. Working through the Commonwealth's Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa, CFMSA, we were active in developing the strategy for phased lifting of sanctions as the reform process proceeded through its various stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also used our aid program to provide assistance in building up the skills and expertise that are needed in the country's democratic and political institutions. We have provided education and training especially in relation to the electoral process, economic planning and policy and in the development of the media. I put on record the government's appreciation for the role played by various Australian non-government organisations, including in particular APHEDA, Austcare, the World Council of Churches and its constituent members, and the UNICEF Committee of Australia, in delivering that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians also played an important and useful part in the election process itself, and I would like to place on record the thanks of the government to all those who contributed in this respect. I mention particularly John Cain, Philip Ruddock, Janine Haines, Professor Duncan Chappell and the Australian Electoral Commissioner, Brian Cox, who participated in the work of the Commonwealth Observer Group. Australia provided staff of the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian Federal Police to assist the South African Independent Electoral Commission and the Goldstone Commission, and there were many other Australians who served in United Nations observer groups, sometimes in extremely difficult and chaotic circumstances. They all deserve our very warm thanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the elections held in the last two weeks of April were a truly remarkable event in the all too fragile history of democratic elections. I know honourable senators will agree that watching the elections, even from thousands of miles away, was an inspiring experience. The overall impression was of an irrepressible groundswell of popular support for the election process, with millions of people queuing, often for interminable periods, to cast their votes. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in his statement last week, it was the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness shown by all parties, especially those who have been victims of apartheid, which made these elections so remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there were organisational problems, both in the conduct of the elections and in the counting which followed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transcending all the administrative difficulties was the pervading spirit of joy and freedom that accompanied the voting. The election brought with it a measure of calm and a significant reduction in the level of political violence. There was remarkable patience all round and, for perhaps cynical and election-weary Australians, this election&mdash;like the Cambodian election before it last year&mdash;was a powerful reminder of the value of, and the weight placed by ordinary people in every country upon, that basic democratic freedom, the right to vote. </PARA>

We have decided to undertake a new aid program which will involve the expenditure of $30 million over the next three years. This represents a 35 per cent increase in aid flows to South Africa over those which have applied in previous years. This level of assistance will allow us to consolidate and continue the important nation-building assistance and skills development we have extended to date. It will also enable the development of new programs of assistance in the vitally important area of providing basic needs and infrastructure for the underprivileged majority so grossly disadvantaged for so long by apartheid.

It is certainly the sentiment of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. Also, on a personal note, as one who has visited South Africa a number of times, both before I became a senator in this place and since, and as one who has witnessed the struggle at first hand, there is something even a little more exhilarating to now recognise what has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a victory for democracy after a long and difficult struggle. Really, it is an end to an evil, racially structured system.

From the political struggle, however, they now face the social and economic struggle, and that should not be underestimated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just dwell for a moment on Nelson Mandela the man. There is no doubt that he has earned his place in history as a very great man, not just because of his determination for his cause, not just because of the personal sacrifice that he made&mdash;27 years in gaol&mdash;not just because of his obviously enormous intellectual and personal capacities, but particularly because of his courage and his dignity. That he could suffer for so long and yet put all that behind him with no apparent malice at all and no apparent feelings of vengeance, that he could come out of gaol after, as I said, nearly three decades imprisonment and then pursue peacefully a political goal with the sort of dignity that he demonstrated, has in fact set him as an example and inspiration to many all over the world well beyond South Africa. So he justly deserves his place in history as a great man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate F.W. de Klerk, who is still president and about to hand over the mantle to Mr Mandela. I congratulate also the more enlightened leadership of the National Party in South Africa. It, under the leadership of F.W. de Klerk, recognised that the way the minority had chosen was unfair and unjust and had to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many&mdash;from time to time, I think I might have been among them&mdash;who thought that the minority in South Africa would not give up power without violent conflict. There was a clear feeling that the minority&mdash;some because of concern of losing power or privilege; some because they felt that they had earned their particular wealth or opportunity; but some simply out of straight fear of the unknown&mdash;would not give up their position without further conflict. The change in attitude that occurred, as was demonstrated in the white referendum, I think can be very much attributed to F.W. de Klerk. Through it, I think that he has also justly earned his place in history as an enlightened leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, many individuals&mdash;and Senator Evans mentioned a few; people like Helen Suzman&mdash;who made a special contribution, but it seems to me, from my observation, that there is a wider group that also deserves credit. I had the privilege to visit South Africa about a year ago with a few of my colleagues from this chamber, including Senator Rod Kemp. We observed, at the time of the constitutional debate, the enormous obstacles that still appeared between that time and the achievement of a peaceful transition. Nevertheless, we returned to Australia believing that it would occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What gave us confidence was not only the sort of leadership which I have already mentioned, but also the fact that it was apparent to us that there was a majority of ordinary South Africans from all races and all political groups who wanted it to occur and were prepared to commit themselves to the building and the challenge of a new South Africa. In other words, they had determined not only that it should occur but also that it was just and proper and it must occur, and they wanted to be part of that challenge. It was our assessment that that quiet majority in the middle, putting aside the minority of extremists on all sides, would ensure that this peaceful transition came about. It seems to me that this is also very much their victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of less importance, it seems to me, but nevertheless useful, have also been the efforts of government and individuals worldwide who have encouraged, firstly, the need for change, and, secondly, the practical aspects of change. We have had debate from time to time over the years about the best ways in which the international community could be helpful. We had the complex debate on sanctions. There is probably little purpose gained in reliving that debate. Particular individuals&mdash;such as Malcolm Fraser on our side who, I must say, was graciously mentioned by Senator Gareth Evans in his speech&mdash;played a major part in galvanising a recognition, perhaps through more conservative Australia and the likes of Malcolm Fraser in other developed countries, that we also must not be afraid of change in South Africa and must be prepared to constructively work for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we have sought to do in our way. The fact that we have from time to time argued that the international sanction regime was not the best way to achieve that goal was not, as some have said from time to time in this place, to try to fight a rearguard action against change but to look for the most constructive way in which the international community could contribute to change. As a Liberal, I am pleased to stand here today and recognise the particular contribution that our former leader Malcolm Fraser played in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The African National Congress has won the election and it is to be congratulated. As you know, Mr Deputy President, we have not been blind supporters of the ANC. I must say that over the years some of its policies have caused me great distress, perhaps none more so than the policy of liberation before education, which resulted in a generation of young South Africans missing the opportunity for education. But I guess it is easy to be judgmental from afar and from the environment of peace and protection within which we live, and so those debates also are now behind us. There are good people in the ANC, some of whom I have met at the leadership level, that I have confidence will play a significant role in leading the new South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also mention the challenge ahead. I do so against the background that we all recognise that expectations have now reached an enormous high. There is this feeling of exhilaration&mdash;Senator Evans spoke of it&mdash;in terms of the long queues of people who participated in the democratic process and took the opportunity to vote in an air of great excitement. But the path ahead&mdash;particularly, as I said, the path to economic equality and social equality&mdash;is going to be incredibly difficult. I hope that when South Africa settles down to address the shortcomings in education, health, housing and jobs, the international community will offer the country and the people as much support as possible and at least as much support as it put into endeavouring to influence political change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are ways that we in the more fortunate world can help. We can help directly with direct aid. Senator Evans has announced a small extra contribution from the Australian government in that regard, and we on this side of the chamber welcome that. We can also help in encouraging as quickly as possible the further development of trade and industry. I, for one, on behalf of this side of the chamber, am pleased to have been associated with the development of Australian South African business groups in both Sydney and Melbourne. The more we can now get in, free of a sanctions regime, and trade with South Africa, the more we can help it build its economy and bring wealth that can be distributed in perhaps a more equitable way than in the past. So I trust that the international community will continue to offer constructive help in the spirit that it also was determined to bring about change. </PARA>

Today is a time to pay tribute to both Nelson Mandela and former President de Klerk, who together showed remarkable courage and humility in the face of what many would have assumed to be overwhelming obstacles. Their example should serve to remind all politicians throughout the world of what can be achieved for the peoples we seek to represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few weeks I, along with many Australians,  have been very moved when watching scenes on television of hundreds of South Africans standing in long queues simply to exercise their first chance to cast a vote, to exercise that basic democratic right. I felt how much we take that for granted in this country and how we complain about the queues we have on election day for a totally different reason. Like many Australians, I, too, felt the emotion of the moment as we witnessed within those queues the aged and the infirm waiting patiently for hours to have their chance to have a say in how they should be governed. It was one of those rare moments when a picture told a thousand stories, and it certainly reminded me of Steinbeck's theme of the triumph of the human spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have been politically active at some time over the last two decades will be aware of the crime that is apartheid. Many of us were personally involved in the fight to eliminate it. As a nation, I think, Australia can be proud that under both Liberal and Labor Party governments we were involved in rallying the international community to take a stand against this outrageous system of dividing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we can deservedly join in the celebrations of the new South Africa as we mark the end of one traumatic chapter of struggle in that country's history. We join with all South Africans in wishing that country well in the new future and, as Senator Hill has said, the difficult future that lies ahead. No-one underestimates that task. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), in his remarks, has made it clear that Australia is obligated to help in the task of rebuilding the South African nation. The Democrats certainly concur with this pledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be realistic, though. If we acknowledge that South Africa's recent past has been a traumatic one, we must acknowledge that the journey ahead for South Africans will also be a struggle. As president-elect, Nelson Mandela is now faced with the task of forging not only a new nation, but one with a different sense of national unity. This may well be President Mandela's most difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a starting point, and with the way it represents members from other political groups in a country that has been divided for so long, this is a very constructive start and one which sends an important symbolic message to all South Africans and, beyond that, to the international community. In some sections of South Africa, this new post-election phase of rebuilding is now being referred to as the `second struggle'. In many ways, that is a very applicable and appropriate description. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One recent documentary feature on the ABC showed a number of black voters being interviewed about their expectations of the future ahead. In response to the question about how long they would give Nelson Mandela and the new government before they expected to get jobs, houses and cars, many replied `two months' or `six months'. That feeling of the need for action is understandable. Nevertheless, it is of great concern that very few people were prepared to concede that life is not going to change overnight. It will take years and years before the real and tangible benefits are brought to these people and before the many injustices and inequalities of the past can be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Impatience for immediate results is perhaps going to be the new government's greatest hurdle. Who can blame the people of South Africa for that impatience? After years of oppression and violence, it is understandable that expectations are now so great. I think there are parallels in Australia with people's expectations that ATSIC will be able to solve everything within a few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill outlined some of the problems which the new South Africa faces. I want to touch on a couple of them. Officially, unemployment stands at 46 per cent. Official black youth unemployment stands at 57 per cent, with some urban areas recording rates of over 80 per cent. The reality of underemployment is, of course, much worse than this. These are shocking statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of South Africa is made worse by widespread violence. South Africa now records the highest levels of violence and crime of anywhere in the world. The effects of this violence on all South Africans, black and white, are palpable. We need to address the psychology of violence. The danger is that it can give rise to unrealistic notions of entitlement as redress for past wrongs. People can, in turn, seek to use this as a justification for further violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the Australian government's indication that our further aid program to South Africa will include a component focusing on good governance and strengthening the various institutions of government. Poverty is widespread. The conditions in the squatter camps of South Africa in many cases represent the worst of Third World conditions. Thousands of black South Africans have absolutely no access to basic medical services, educational services or facilities such as clean water, power and sewerage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that the ANC election platform relied on the promise of embarking on massive public works programs to provide training and employment for about 2 1/2 million people over the next 10 years. This will be accompanied by the building of one million homes for the homeless and the provision of clean running water and electricity to an additional 2 1/2 million homes. As well, there is a pledge to re-work the education system so that every child in South Africa has access to at least 10 years free and compulsory education. I am sure we all understand the setting of these goals and why they have been chosen as priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I think we can predict is that the politics of national unity, which is the new South Africa, will mean that compromise is inevitable. It is probably a necessary thing, as acknowledged by Nelson Mandela himself, especially when it comes to the economic policies that need to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Democrats leader Janine Haines was in South Africa recently during the election period, as one of a number of Australian observers. She has made the point to us that the rebuilding of South Africa is more than purely an economic task. It will require massive changes in society and in the attitudes of many South Africans. For example, she pointed to the attitude of all South Africans, black and white, to the status of women in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of women candidates during the elections across all the political parties is but one example which underlines this need. The absence of women from senior positions in both business and the public service certainly indicates, as we realise here in Australia, that all South African women have a struggle ahead of them to achieve equality in the workplace and in politics. In fact, for many South Africans it is probably true that, as one struggle has now finished, another one has only just begun. This is certainly true for the women of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the circumstances, the Democrats believe that the government's new aid program to South Africa should have also included a component aimed at improving the status of women in society. As we already fund a women in development program in other countries, we think this would have been perfectly appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another overriding message of hope that must be stressed in any discussion of South Africa; that is, the combined efforts of so many individuals can make a difference and can remedy social injustice. As we look around us in despair at the tragedies of Bosnia, Rwanda and Afghanistan, we are often prompted to feel that it is all too hard or too hopeless. It is tragic that the international community often seems too unwilling to take up&mdash;or incapable of taking up and continuing&mdash;these further struggles for justice and human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Africa will always be an example to us that the efforts of individuals can make the significant difference. When the fight for democracy started all those years ago, how many people in the rest of the world gave the human rights agencies and their struggle for democracy any chance of success? It is an example of human perseverance in the face of adversity. I, too, want to congratulate and pay tribute to the work of Desmond Tutu, Helen Suzman and Walter Sisulu. Their efforts will stand forever. When they were joined by the other nations of Africa, by trade unions from all over the world and by journalists from dozens of countries who chose not to ignore but to highlight injustice, the momentum built until the international community could no longer ignore the need to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget the role of the Commonwealth in all of this. Despite the attitude of some of its leaders, the Commonwealth persisted with the imposition of economic, commercial, trade and sporting contacts against the South African regime. Australia's efforts in the imposition of such sanctions, and the efforts of so many other nations, undoubtedly helped to bring about the dismantling of apartheid. It proves that sanctions can make a difference when international will is present. As the minister correctly concedes, the imposition of sanctions can often provide the crucial psychological difference to bringing about change in international politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does provide us with something to reflect on in a wider global sense today because there does remain so much injustice equal in nature to the system of South African apartheid. Just as the international will was finally present to make a difference in South Africa, the Democrats believe that such will could also make a difference elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to examine our actions in relation to other examples of international injustice. Just as we campaigned for so long to free Nelson Mandela, so too should we campaign to free Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma or Xanana Gusmao in East Timor. Just as we saw the injustices of South African apartheid and sought to overturn them, so too do we now have a similar obligation to work for peace and justice in such places as Burma and East Timor. And we should not forget what has happened in Palestine, Cyprus and Bosnia. South Africa proves that it can be done. </PARA>

Many of us waited anxiously to see whether the promises would result in genuine change. To our joy, things did begin to change. The pass laws were gone. Political organisations were taken off the banned list. Individuals who had been banned were free to move about, to speak out publicly about the hateful apartheid and to meet together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, nothing had the symbolic power and gripped the attention of the world as much as, firstly, the imprisonment and then, secondly, the release of Nelson Mandela in February 1990. There is a real sense in which our remarks today must be a tribute to the newly elected president&mdash;or about to be elected president&mdash;of South Africa. I will come back to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Africa which has emerged from last week's election is a new country. It has not merely undergone a change of government; it has fundamentally changed. It faces the future with a new and glorious flag and a new set of relationships both within and with the world outside. I do not think anybody can fail but be inspired by the way the anthem of this country is sung.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this change has come about through a process of negotiation with enormous obstacles, suspicion and potential  for failure should give us hope for the possibility of change in many other places.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a tribute to the central figures involved. Some have clearly acted out of necessity, and others perhaps out of fear of being left out. But others have grasped a seeming impossibility and have set their sights on justice. That is the tribute I believe we must pay to Nelson Mandela. After nearly three decades in prison, he emerged ready to take up where he had left off: with a vision of justice and what that word meant for South Africa. The personal meaning of that for me is if, instead of entering the Senate two years ago, I had gone to prison for 27 years and then come out for five years and become president&mdash;it is that kind of dimension that this man of 75 years has lived through; and it is a truly miraculous time that we now hail. </PARA>

He appears to be utterly without bitterness, in spite of the treatment he has received at the hands of a system which despised him and everything he stood for. It is beyond me to conceive of the changes in South Africa without his energy, his goodwill and his commitment to justice. We must remember, too, that he is also a symbol of the many other African people who did the same in a private way that is not observable to us in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nelson Mandela's commitment to his vision, and that of the people he represents, demonstrates an integration of spirituality, humanity and politics which the world rarely sees. To see him dancing for joy the other day, as the results of the elections became clear, showed a man of joy in a situation which would terrify many of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the changes have not been without cost. Countless people have been killed or injured as the old order has been gradually dismantled. That tragedy should not be ignored or simply forgotten in the joy of the last week. It reminds us that change is rarely universally welcomed and, apparently, the bigger the change the greater the reaction against it. Violence in South Africa did not come to an end with the announcement of the end of apartheid. Perhaps it will not end now. Only time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the way the system of apartheid itself was consigned to the history books, we should not only congratulate those involved but also be encouraged that the most difficult changes in past structures can be brought about by negotiation and peaceful resolution of conflict. It is a lesson for the entire world and, none the least, for Australia as we face up to a range of seemingly intractable problems, particularly in relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new South Africa now faces the daunting task of bringing about a new reality for the millions who have never known what it means to be free citizens. Even from this distance, it is a task which seems too big and too complex. The new government, led by Mr Mandela, has a clear mandate to  bring about sweeping changes. But its power is not absolute. The election gave the ANC less than the two-thirds vote it needed if it wanted to re-write the new constitution alone. It is significant and a measure of the president-elect that he has said publicly that he is pleased his party is not in a position to do so because it will allay fears in some quarters that the ANC would become a dictatorial force in government. He is still not afraid of having to negotiate to achieve a satisfactory outcome, and may be signalling that he believes the constitution would be better as a result of bringing together as wide a range of people and ideas as possible. It is another lesson which people in other parts of the world could well learn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, then, is our role as another member of the community of nations? How will Australia relate to the new South Africa? It is my hope that&mdash;as we played our part in putting pressure on the apartheid regime through boycotts, sanctions and other international measures&mdash;we will now assist in the emerging of the new South Africa. I know that our expertise has been offered, as has the opportunity to trade, to renew so many relationships which were put on hold over the last 20 years or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what of our generosity? Australians are very generous people with their time, their money and their goodwill. Now is the time to commit ourselves to assist in whatever ways we can. I also urge that those whose concern is trade see the new South Africa as a community of people, and not simply as another market to be exploited. I am certain that trade will continue to grow, as it has done since the sanctions and  boycotts were lifted. But I would be deeply saddened if Australians were so intent on securing a financial gain that they missed the human gains which have been made and will be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans in his speech spoke about our provision of assistance to South Africa when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I believe there will be an important role&mdash;and opportunity&mdash;for the Australian private sector in contributing its technology and expertise, particularly in areas such as low cost housing, sanitation and safe water, health care, roads and electricity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true. We have much to share. We also have much to learn, and we need to do these for our own Aboriginal people in Australia and to be in a relationship of learning mutually how to combat the problems that indigenous people suffer in their own land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three major impacts on me have been the commitment to democracy, the commitment to peaceful resolution of conflict and the commitment to consensus in a political sense. I do take comfort, as a member of the Senate, in proportional representation. In a parliamentary library talk, Dr Etherington pointed out, at the 50 per cent mark of votes being counted, that had one of our major political parties had 60 per cent of the vote, the next major one 20 per cent, the next eight per cent and the next three per cent, how much would the 60 per cent party be talking to any of the others, let alone offering the one on the bottom of the list a cabinet position? I do believe there is a wisdom in wanting to share the burden of the new government of South Africa with all those who deserve a voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and final inspiration to me is that integration of spirituality with culture that is demonstrated every time the anthem is sung.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With other honourable senators present here, I congratulate the people of South Africa on the changes they have made and on the way they have made them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to speak for long in this debate&mdash;indeed, we do not have a great deal of time so to do. I do want to say something to mark this very important occasion: the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President of the Republic of South Africa, as a result of the election decision of the people of South Africa in the first multi-racial vote that has taken place in that country. It is my belief that this has inspired many people throughout the world, and I hope it continues to do so. I hope that the efforts of those who have been elected are fruitful and result in justice, economic development, and the material wellbeing and spiritual welfare of that country and the people thereof.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in the debate thus far about those individuals and groups who have contributed to the overthrow of that despicable policy, apartheid. I must also pay tribute to those who have been instrumental in overthrowing that apartheid policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were great pressures put on people within Australia to go on free visits to South Africa to be shown off, as it were, and paraded around that country lauding the apartheid system. Those people who refused to take part in that are to be commended. Those people, both within business and within the trade union movement, who shunned and spurned those offers are to be commended, because the offers were in fact inducements. I am glad to say that many people saw them for what they were&mdash;an attempt to bolster a policy which was anti-human and degrading, a violation of the basic human rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us would understand how the people feel, how those who are of a different race or religion feel, and how the burning breath of blind prejudice sears into their very being. I have felt for the Africans in South Africa who have faced up to and borne that dreadful burden over those many years. I have supported strongly their stand. Indeed, I was very proud to have a South African, Colin Sacco, as my running mate in the election two years ago. His family was a white South African family. They were descendants of the Boers. They found it so objectionable that they were making their statements. I am talking about some years ago when it was very dangerous for people like that to say things against the regime and the apartheid policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family eventually decided that it was time to leave the country. Those people who have done that now have the opportunity, I suppose, of returning to the country. Certainly those people are very overjoyed at the results thus far achieved. We should also congratulate those many hundreds of thousands of people in that situation who have stood on principle and refused the blandishments offered by the perpetrators of that dreadful, inhuman policy of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of the churches. Certainly a majority of the churches in South Africa have been very strong in upholding the human rights of the African people. The Catholic Church is included in this. Its aid agency, ACR, the Australian Catholic Relief, has, of course, been prominent in its strong opposition to apartheid and support for the African people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a long row to hoe. There is a long road for the people of South Africa. It is for us to assist those people in their aspirations. I welcome the statement made today by the minister about the provision of aid. Thirty million dollars over three years, I suggest, is not a great deal. Although it represents a 35 per cent increase in aid flow to South Africa over previous years, that does not amount to a great deal, I am afraid. I have been one of those who have been critical of the way that Africa as a whole has been treated in the aid budget, but this is not the time, perhaps, to talk about those particular matters. I welcome the fact that the government has at least made this contribution. I hope that the government may see its way clear to improve upon that and to realise that Africans love their children. It is a young country; it is a very vigorous country; and we hope that it achieves the objectives that I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am very taken with the national anthem. Senator Chamarette was very eloquent; I could not match what she has said&mdash;nor do I try&mdash;about the spiritual element that was obviously coming to the fore in the celebrations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1994-95. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr President, this Budget will:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">maximise economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">promote social justice; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a budget that seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, this is a highly distinctive budget. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the first budget in the history of the nation that has been introduced prior to the commencement of the financial year to which it relates. </PARA>
<PARA>This brings Australia into line with the major industrial countries and with normal private sector practice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also the first budget which provides estimates of the budget outcome for the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This represents a new benchmark for budget reporting and government accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>The economic forecasts on which this Budget is built reflect the fact that we are now firmly in recovery and experiencing economic growth faster than almost any other industrial country. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, our economic fundamentals for continued growth are the best for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>This gives us the real prospect of maintaining strong economic and employment growth for the rest of the century. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget also maintains, indeed accelerates, the Government's commitment to its deficit reduction program, which requires the deficit to be reduced to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>Our forecast deficit for 1996-97 is now less than one per cent of GDP, and we expect the budget to be in surplus soon thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>In achieving this outcome, we have not increased general taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget contains no new taxes and no increases in tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>The only measures which add to revenue are those which improve tax compliance, or are directly related to cost recovery for government services. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia will remain one of the lowest taxed countries in the industrial world. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, this Budget maintains Labor's commitment to improve social justice in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to major initiatives to address the serious issue of long-term unemployment, announced last week in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, this Budget contains further measures to assist the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>This reflects Labor's determination not only to maximise growth of our economy, employment and real incomes, but to ensure as well that all sections of our society share in that increased prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in last year's Budget Speech, the then Treasurer stressed that the primary objective of that Budget was jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to say tonight that the period of jobless growth that marked the first year and three-quarters of recovery from the recession is now well and truly behind us. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is now experiencing strong employment growth with over 230,000 extra jobs since April last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment has fallen from a peak of just over 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>And there is every reason to expect these favourable developments to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>Our economic settings are now highly conducive to growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflation remains at its lowest level for three decades and is less than that of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflationary expectations are also low, which means we have excellent prospects for continuing to be a low inflation nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates on bank lending are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>Business confidence is high. </PARA>
<PARA>In manufacturing industry it is at the highest level for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Consumer confidence is at its highest level for ten years, and is near record levels. </PARA>
<PARA>Wages are increasingly being determined on an enterprise basis and with regard to productivity improvement. </PARA>
<PARA>Productivity is increasing markedly and in some cases quite spectacularly. </PARA>
<PARA>Real unit labour costs are declining. </PARA>
<PARA>Profit share is near its all time high. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's international competitiveness continues to improve and is now 30 per cent greater than it was a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Time lost in industrial disputes in 1993 was the lowest level for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the widespread program of microeconomic reform instituted by this Government over the last decade has transformed the Australian economy so that it is now much more competitive, efficient and export oriented. </PARA>
<PARA>Rather than relying on our good fortune to be a relatively small nation with vast natural resources, the so-called "lucky country" syndrome, we are now demonstrating to the world that we are determined to work hard and intelligently to maximise our economic welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>We can now see the results beginning to come through. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's economic growth of 4 per cent in 1993 was far better than most industrial countries which collectively grew by just over one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of them, including such major economies as Germany, France and Italy, suffered economic contraction, and our single largest trading partner, Japan, had virtually no growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Our employment growth of 3 per cent over the last year is also high. </PARA>
<PARA>For the industrial countries as a whole, employment growth in 1993 was zero. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian manufacturing industry increased its production by 9 per cent in 1993, the largest increase for two decades. </PARA>
<PARA>And our export performance in recent years has been nothing less than outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA>The volume of manufacturing exports grew by 15 per cent in 1993, and has grown by an average of 13 per cent a year since the mid-80s. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly exports of services grew by 11 per cent last year and have increased by 9 per cent per annum since the mid-80s. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of these developments, commodities now represent around 65 per cent of our total volume of exports, compared to almost 80 per cent a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA>With commodity prices now being at very low levels, that diversification of our exports is standing us in very good stead. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that our exporters have done so well is due to Australia's improved competitiveness, and two further major factors. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the fast growing countries of East Asia (excluding Japan) have become increasingly important markets. </PARA>
<PARA>These countries have been growing at twice the pace of our major trading partners as a whole since 1990-91, and now account for 33 per cent of our merchandise exports compared to only 19 per cent ten years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>And second&mdash;less tangible but no less important&mdash;is the attitudinal change among Australian firms&mdash;an increasingly outward orientation, which recognises the enormous potential benefits of selling into world markets, particularly in the fast growing Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA>This attitudinal change reflects, in part, the benefit of this Government's policy to open up markets to competition, especially through reduced protection, and its success in developing trade relations in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, with these very substantial improvements to our economic structure, Australians can look forward to the future with considerable confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Our immediate prospects are for even faster growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, compared to 4 per cent in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment is expected to increase by 3 per cent, or almost another quarter of a million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 9 1/2 per cent by June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index is forecast to remain low next year at 2 1/4 per cent, or about the level of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>Real wages and real household disposable income continued to grow in 1993-94 and are forecast to grow more strongly in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>Crucial to the achievement of these outcomes will be a substantial upturn in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>So far, business investment has made little contribution to economic recovery, but this is expected to change quite markedly in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>Continued strong economic growth, near record high profit levels, high business confidence, low interest rates and inflation, sharply rising capacity utilisation, and the completion of the process of corporate balance sheet repair following the excesses of the 1980s, are all conducive factors for increased business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, this Government has created a very favourable tax regime for business over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes the provision of accelerated depreciation allowances, a development allowance for large projects, the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure, and reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>These tax incentives will reduce the Government's tax revenue for 1994-95 by around $3 billion&mdash;a substantial benefit to business which will grow in later years. </PARA>
<PARA>All this represents a powerful set of inducements  for increased business investment which is forecast to grow by 14 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>While import growth will pick up next year as business investment increases, the current account deficit should increase only slightly. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia's export performance should remain robust over the next year, with strong growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and of services continuing from recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of trade is forecast to lift for the first time since 1988-89, although only slightly, due to the gradual improvement in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Economic activity in the major industrial countries is forecast to increase to around 2 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly a bull point for our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The much faster growth rates of the dynamic economies of our region mean our major trading partners' growth will be 3 3/4 per cent, up half a percentage point on 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA>That overall improvement in world economic growth will help to sustain the higher level of economic growth now evident in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Sustained growth through the decade will also require the maintenance of a low rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Monetary policy over the medium term will be directed to keeping inflation and inflationary expectations at low levels. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government said during the election campaign that its election commitments would be delivered in the context of a declining budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>This it will do. </PARA>
<PARA>In last year's Budget the Government set out a budget deficit reduction strategy geared to securing a deficit of around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>When an economy is in recession, it is entirely appropriate that budgetary policy be deployed to support the economy and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>That involves a rising deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>But as the pace of economic growth quickens, and recovery starts to become self-sustaining, it is important that budgetary support to domestic demand be pared back. </PARA>
<PARA>By winding back the deficit, the public sector reduces its call on national saving. </PARA>
<PARA>This increases our capacity to finance further private sector investment without the need for greater recourse to other nations' savings through increased overseas borrowings and foreign equity investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government fully recognises this and has implemented one of the most rigorous fiscal consolidation programs of all industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Details are contained in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the outcomes contained in this Budget are for lower deficits as a percentage of GDP than those forecast last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Those lower deficits will ensure that Australia's government debt, as a proportion of GDP, remains among the lowest for industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the Government legislated major steps to implement its deficit reduction strategy, and ensure that the 1996-97 outcome would accord with its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>This involved a package of measures which improved the projected outcome for 1996-97 by almost 1 3/4 3/4 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>Included amongst those measures was postponement of the second leg of the foreshadowed tax cuts worth over $3 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>This year we have again constrained all but the highest priority expenditure measures. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of this action, and the Government's capacity to improve its fiscal consolidation program without further tax increases, we have decided not to introduce a jobs levy as proposed in last December's Green Paper as a means of paying for the initiatives in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a levy would have substantially counteracted the tax cuts brought in only last November. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I now turn to the Budget outcome and forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA>The budget deficit for the current financial year, 1993-94, is now expected to be $13.6 billion&mdash;$2.4 billion lower than forecast at budget time last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The budget deficit for 1994-95 will be $11.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>The deficit will therefore fall from an expected 3.2 per cent of GDP this year to 2.5 per cent next year. </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly meets the requirement set by this Government in its Fiscal Framework for a credible decline in the deficit towards the objective of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA>And the budget deficit for 1996-97 is now projected to be 0.9 per cent of GDP, or 0.3 of a percentage point lower than projected after last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>By 1997-98 the budget will be approaching balance. </PARA>
<PARA>The major initiatives announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> mean there has been little room for other new spending while maintaining the deficit reduction program. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, over half a billion dollars of new spending in 1994-95 is contained in tonight's Budget, but it is more than offset by other measures announced tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>There will therefore be no expenditure blowout. </PARA>
<PARA>Outlays as a percentage of GDP are forecast to fall from 26.6 this year to 26.2 in 1994-95 and will fall by a further two percentage points over the subsequent three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the only revenue enhancements in this Budget relate to improved tax compliance and cost recovery in government services, total revenue will increase slightly as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>That is due to the impact of economic recovery&mdash;especially increased employment&mdash;and measures introduced in last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Revenue growth will however be slower than in previous recoveries due to low inflation, continuing tariff reductions, reduced dividends from government enterprises, and reductions in interest receipts resulting from the repayment of State debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, revenue as a share of GDP will remain well below the levels of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>MEASURES IN THE BUDGET</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I now move on to the main measures contained in this Budget&mdash;full details are provided in supporting documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget reaffirms this Government's commitment to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> the Prime Minister announced a range of new policies and programs costing $6.5 billion over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>These programs are primarily aimed at reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The key initiative in the package&mdash;the Job Compact&mdash;will help long-term unemployed people to get the skills and experience they need to get back into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> includes extensive reforms to labour market assistance including case management and improvements to the delivery of labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The social security system will be restructured to reflect changes in our society and to remove disincentives to work. </PARA>
<PARA>A Parenting Allowance will be introduced for eligible unemployed people and low-income earners. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> also includes training and education reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>Entry-level training places will be increased and a new Youth Training Allowance will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The package also includes a regional development strategy, important microeconomic reforms and an industry policy aimed at improving enterprise competitiveness and developing international markets for Australian goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this Government has a firm commitment to improving the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's Budget commits almost $1 1/2 billion over the next ten years to build up a self-sustaining National Land Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The Land Fund is a major element of the Government's response to the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA>It recognises that many indigenous people have been dispossessed of their land and will not directly benefit from Native Title Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>But besides land, the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples remains of continuing concern to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The standard of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is still well below that of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Current health services, across all levels of government, are not meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA>To redress this situation, a further $500 million will be provided over five years to expand and extend Aboriginal health programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, a number of other significant health measures are included in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>To accelerate the process of mental health reform and to address areas of concern identified by the Report of the National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness, $169 million will be spent over four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This builds on funds already provided through the National Mental Health Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>These new funds also support the continuation of vocational rehabilitation services for people with a psychiatric disability. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Government is very concerned about the tragic loss and trauma to Australian women occasioned by breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA>To improve our understanding and treatment of their problem, the Government is providing $209 million over four years in funding for a National Breast Cancer Program. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes $187 million for the continuation and expansion of the national screening program, and $22 million for a national breast cancer centre and a breast cancer fundraising foundation. </PARA>
<PARA>As a step towards the Prime Minister's election commitment of lifting health and medical research funding to two per cent of total health expenditure by the year 2000, an additional $93 million is being made available for research over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased funding for breast cancer research projects is expected to result, with decisions being based firmly on the quality of research applications. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, vaccine-preventable diseases in children have been rising. </PARA>
<PARA>This, in a wealthy nation, is simply not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>To address this, an additional $9 1/2 million will be spent in 1994-95 on promoting childhood immunisation. </PARA>
<PARA>In aggregate this Budget allocates almost one billion dollars over four years for new and expanded health programs&mdash;without increasing the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA>A package of measures worth $62.7 million over four years will assist homeless people through the enhancement of accommodation assistance, the extension of rent assistance to young homeless students and improved community support services. </PARA>
<PARA>Our aim in extending rent assistance to young homeless students on the Austudy Student Homeless Rate is to encourage them to stay in education or training. </PARA>
<PARA>After aligning the Personal Income Test for these students with that for the Youth Training Allowance, the net cost of this assistance will be $37.5 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the $2000 rise in the Austudy Supplementary Loan Scheme limit announced last year, the limit will be further increased from $6000 to $7000 from 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Access to Justice will be enhanced by a number of measures, including expanded community and Family Court mediation services, and increased funding for legal aid and disability discrimination programs. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of new and specially-tailored programs for Veterans are contained in the 1994-95 Budget, addressing the needs of younger and older Veterans and including initiatives which will be welcomed by war widows and widowers, and merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA>Younger Veterans will benefit from a greater focus on rehabilitation, early intervention and health promotion programs as well as assistance for those with psychiatric difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget also contains measures which respond to concerns raised over recent years about inconsistencies in the determination of disability pension claims.</PARA>
<PARA>Maintaining our strong commitment to the environment, the Commonwealth is offering to fund a Daintree Rescue Package on a joint basis with the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This will ensure protection of this unique area. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney 2000 Olympics will be a tremendous event for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>To support Australia's athletes in these historic games, the Government will provide $135 million  over the next six years for athlete preparation. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, Australia's Development Co-operation program is an important means of promoting sustainable economic and social advancement in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>By improving the standard of living of people in these countries, Australia is helping give those worse off than ourselves a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is providing an additional $68.4 million to the Development Co-operation program in 1994-95, primarily for initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region including Indochina. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a significant real increase in aid funding, continuing the trend set in 1990-91, and keeps Australia's aid contribution above the average for industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will fund a national Asian languages and studies program for Australian schools at a net cost of $48 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA>This will improve language and cultural skills and provide a solid platform for strengthening our cultural and business links with Asia well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, a number of savings measures are also contained in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) will be aligned with income tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Repayments will now reflect the proportion of the year during which those with HECS obligations earn above the repayments threshold. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also decided on a further program of asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA>As announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation,</EMPHASIS> it is the Government's view that airports now owned by the Federal Airports Corporation would perform better for the community if they were privately owned. </PARA>
<PARA>Towards this end, to promote competition and allow clear comparisons of performance between airports, the Government will work through a process to prepare these airports for sale. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also announced its intention to sell its full equity in the Australian Industry Development Corporation Limited. </PARA>
<PARA>While there are no general taxation increases in this Budget, there are some measures to improve tax compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>The ATO has identified a range of areas under existing laws where compliance can be improved&mdash;either directly through better procedures for the collection of outstanding taxes, or indirectly through measures which can be expected to boost voluntary compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of these areas have been the subject of recommendations by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Auditor General. </PARA>
<PARA>This measure is expected to increase tax revenues by $300 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA>There are also measures to improve cost recovery for government services. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Securities Commission fee structure will be simplified and rationalised. </PARA>
<PARA>This will ensure that more of the costs of company regulation are borne by the companies and market participants who benefit, rather than taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes will generate about $40 million a year and restore the fees in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 January 1995 the departure tax will be replaced by a $27 charge for international passengers to recover the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine services and short-term visa processing. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1992-93 Budget the Government announced the phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred in implementing safety standards and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standards setting and compliance services. </PARA>
<PARA>As a further step in this process, this Budget increases cost recovery by $25.3 million, via an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur, and a special charge on Australian international operators. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is also announcing several taxation initiatives in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the review announced in last year's Budget of the operation of Employee Share Acquisition Schemes, the Government will substantially improve incentives for schemes that will best foster workplace productivity growth and encourage employees to take an ownership stake in their company. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time it will institute measures to prevent Employee Share Acquisition Schemes being misused. </PARA>
<PARA>From tonight, employees participating in schemes  that offer shares in their employer's company will be able either to receive $500 per year in the form of tax exempt discounts on shares, or to defer tax for up to ten years on up to $1500 worth of shares. </PARA>
<PARA>In both cases, the shares must be held for at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA>And the schemes will be subject to a range of conditions to ensure they are equitable to all employees and encourage improvements in workplace productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be releasing further details of the arrangements tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will be undertaking a review of Fringe Benefits Tax compliance costs, in light of concerns that have been expressed about the costs borne by business in complying with the FBT. </PARA>
<PARA>The aim of the review will be to minimise FBT compliance costs whilst protecting the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA>I will announce details of the review shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>Excise on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene will be reduced by almost two cents per litre from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>The reduction in fuel oil excise will provide significant benefits to coastal shipping and export-oriented minerals projects. </PARA>
<PARA>The superannuation matters outstanding from the FitzGerald Report, and the protection of small amounts, will be addressed in a separate statement I shall make during this Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA>We are currently undertaking extensive consultations with the superannuation industry and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUDING COMMENTS</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the major policy challenge facing Australia is to achieve strong sustainable growth during the 1990s, in order to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that an unemployment rate of 5 per cent should be within our grasp by the turn of the century, and that even lower levels of unemployment are possible in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has probably never been better placed to achieve a prolonged period of high economic and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>In our first seven years in Office&mdash;from 1983 to 1990&mdash;we increased employment by 1.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Emulating this performance should be within our capabilities between now and the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA>To do so will require:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">maintenance of a low rate of inflation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a continuing program of microeconomic reform;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an improved national saving performance with fiscal policy playing an appropriate role. </PARA>
<PARA>All these are areas which the Government has previously recognised and taken steps to address. </PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> statement confirms the Government's determination to develop appropriate policies for sustained long-term growth of output and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget, by confirming and improving the Government's deficit reduction program, takes further steps to enable the realisation of sustained high growth. </PARA>
<PARA>We can be a prosperous, equitable, and fully employed nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us all work to that end!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) made a declaration pursuant to section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act whereby development on what is now known as the Broome crocodile farm was halted. There has been a good deal of publicity about this matter. Indeed, there is a challenge to the minister's decision pending in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the minister made two other decisions, which were temporary ones, imposing 30-day bans on the development of the crocodile farm. As reported recently in the press, on 5 May 1994 the Federal Court rejected the minister's application to have those first two applications dismissed. The situation now is that all three decisions by the minister are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court of Australia. Those actions have been brought by the Western Australian government and Mr Malcolm Douglas, the proprietor of the crocodile farm. I am conscious that there are court proceedings pending, and I will carefully address my remarks to the Senate accordingly. I say at the outset that Mr Douglas is no stranger to the courts, having obtained three decisions in his favour, hitherto, in relation to the development of that crocodile farm. I can tell the Senate that recently I was in the Kimberleys. I visited Mr Douglas at his crocodile farm and saw there the predicament that he faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crocodile farm is not simply a tourist attraction. It provides a number of community services. It provides a home for what are known as rogue crocodiles. Recently, one Aboriginal community that had a large crocodile which was menacing local inhabitants requested Mr Douglas to retrieve the crocodile and to retain it on his premises, which he did. As well as that, the crocodile farm has been involved in research into crocodile breeding. CALM works in close liaison with Mr Douglas. Apart from that, Mr Douglas has an export business in relation to the meat and hides of crocodiles. As such, he employs nine people in the township of Broome. He purchases crocodiles from an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory. He has also employed Aboriginals in part-time work and would provide training to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, we are not just dealing with a property which is rather quaintly referred to as a crocodile farm; it is a lot more than just that. The minister's decision to ban any development in relation to that business has virtually crippled Mr Douglas's operation. Mr Douglas had an enforceable lease. He ran his business accordingly, with a view to developing it, quite sensibly thinking that he had a lease which was enforceable at law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So he obtained further crocodiles, he developed the farm, he took on more people and then he found that he was challenged in the courts. That was okay&mdash;he went to the courts and he won, three times. It seems that that was not enough for the minister. The minister was not satisfied with the due process of law. He imposed an arbitrary decision to close down the development of that business. Quite frankly, it is an abysmal state of affairs where a small business expends a great deal of money in the courts, wins, and then finds itself facing executive action by the government of the day and is virtually closed down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister commissioned a report by Mr Fred Chaney. It is the circumstances surrounding the commissioning of that report, the circumstances under which the report was obtained and the evidence upon which it was based that is the subject of judicial review. My comment is that it should never have even got to this. It should never have got this far. Australian citizens are entitled to think that once they have gone to the courts and obtained relief, once they have gone to the courts and obtained a decision, that is it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no appeal from the Federal Court decision or the Supreme Court decision. There is no appeal at all. What the Kimberley Land Council did was go to the minister and ask him to exercise his power under section 10 of this act. Under that section the minister has quite wide-sweeping powers&mdash;draconian, in fact. These powers are so forceful that a decision in the Federal Court or the Supreme Court can be overturned. As I say, this will be determined by the Federal Court in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the minister thought that he could dismiss Mr Douglas's two applications and the initial application of the state government of Western Australia, saying that the 30-day bans on the development of the farm would be a waste of taxpayers' money and of no purpose. But it meant a great deal to Mr Douglas, because he was being held up. He could not develop his business, and he had a great deal of investment in that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have to remind fellow senators that in the running of business one needs certainty. One cannot run any business on the basis that a minister&mdash;of whatever persuasion&mdash;might come along like this. Believe you me, if the minister had been a Liberal minister I would still be saying this, because business cannot function this way. It cannot function where a minister is able to wield such autocratic power, especially after the courts have decided. Unfortunately, Mr Douglas finds himself back in the courts again and it seems that he has a long way to go. I find it an absolute travesty that this man is having to engage in court action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, the situation in Broome is not that clear. I spoke to Aboriginal people who do not want this ban to continue. I have spoken to people of Aboriginal descent who would like to see that business developed. They would like to enjoy the fruits of that business by way of employment, by way of the peripheral business it brings to the community of Broome. If anyone thinks that this is an Aboriginal question and that all Aboriginals are united, I can tell them that that is not the case. In fact, there is a competing interest in relation to the land in question between two tribes, namely, the Djugun tribe and the Yawuru tribe. That really is a question that needs to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the challenges facing the committee of which I am privileged to be a member, which is going to oversee the Native Title Act. We will find an Aboriginal population which moved due to climatic circumstances and circumstances brought about by the European settlement&mdash;and I do not shy away from that. The Djugun people claim that they had to move from the Broome peninsula because of resettlement by European settlers but, nonetheless, they maintain they have a claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Yawuru people say that they have a claim. But first we have to sort out who are the legitimate Aboriginal people who are the custodians of the land or who have a traditional usage of the land before we go making any court decision as to whether businesses should be stopped in their tracks. I put it to the Senate that this is not a clear-cut matter; it is very complex if we look at it in the traditional usage sense of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, one would think the law of Australia applies to everybody, yet a citizen has gone to the courts, got a decision in his favour three times and then faced a minister overturning that decision. I find this declaration completely contrary to the way citizens of Australia, be they black, yellow, white or brindle, have been used to this country functioning. The laws of Australia should apply to everyone equally. I believe that in this case Mr Douglas has not been treated in an equal sense or with any equity by the exercise of this declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the ins and outs of the process that the minister adopted, that will be decided by the Federal Court. As to the report itself and the content thereof, that will be decided by the court in due course. Recently, calls by the opposition for the minister to state reasons for the exercise of his discretion under section 10 have been met only with the report itself. One would think that if we had a look at the report it would be all there. Of course it is not. That is not satisfactory. The process should be more transparent. This involves wider questions&mdash;questions which we face daily in this chamber, that is, the decision-making process of government and how citizens can see how the government arrives at a decision. We have seen it in the media print inquiry, for instance, as to how the Foreign Investment Review Board might determine whether foreign investments fail or succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any democracy the processes should be transparent. If the minister were dinkum about this, he would show Malcolm Douglas and the citizens of this country the process of arriving at that decision, the process of banning the development of his business for five years, and he would tell the people of Australia the basis upon which he came to that decision. The report itself is not enough. The report itself is not comprehensive. In a political sense some natural justice should be done to the extent that when people have an adverse decision made against them they should be fully informed as to why that decision was made against them. To this date, I believe that Mr Douglas has not had that civility afforded to him by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think this is a very sad state of affairs. On the face of it people might not think it is much. They might think it is only a crocodile farm. They might even think it is rather quaint and rather unusual, but the principles of this run deep. They are serious principles indeed and ones which reflect a wider problem. I believe that, during the course of this year, this will not be the only time that this chamber will need to look at this situation and the situation of executive power overriding the judiciary or the executive power even overriding the exercise of decisions or debate in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst listening to Senator Ellison, my mind went back to some of the more recent events in the matter that is the subject of this debate. Probably one of the reasons why I was not prepared for an ongoing debate on this matter is that my recall&mdash;I think it was a front page story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;was that Mr Douglas was featured saying that he was going to close the crocodile farm and was locking the gates. I recall also that on one of the television channels&mdash;I cannot remember which one it was&mdash;Mr Douglas repeated the same story. I may be corrected on this because I am relying on my memory and I am not as young as I used to be, but I recall that this event happened possibly a day or two before the presentation of the report by Mr Fred Chaney who had been commissioned by the minister to investigate the sacredness of the sites that the Aboriginal people had claimed were in the area and could be infringed upon by the expansion of Mr Douglas's enterprise in Broome. I thought that the timing was somewhat unusual. If I am correct and it was only a matter of 24 hours before the closure and the presentation of Mr Chaney's report, then there is something rather odd about the matter and there was quite a deal of foresight in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember part of the content of Mr Chaney's report. As I recall it&mdash;and please do forgive me because I am only dealing from memory&mdash;Mr Chaney's investigations had recognised that there were some sites that were very significant to the Aboriginal people in the area. If that is the case, the comments that have been made in this debate about the laws of this country applying to each and every one of us apply here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Chaney's report is correct and there are sites of great significance to local Aboriginal people in that area that could be impinged upon by development, I think the courts of Australia, if that is where this matter is going to be finally decided, will have to take that into consideration.

It is a very serious issue not only for Mr Douglas, the Aboriginal people in Broome, the other residents of Broome, and the people of Western Australia, but it is a very significant event for all Australian people at this time in our historical development. It is less than six months ago that we passed the native title bill in this place in the early hours of 23 December.

As I said, I did not know the debate was coming on. An investigation has shown where it appears on the red, and I thank the Senate Table Office for sending over the document which fully informs the Senate where this matter is being debated.

I think that has already been canvassed in a previous debate in the chamber. But there are a couple of important matters that need to be raised. The first relates to the process by which this determination by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was made. The second relates to the longer term consequences, which Senator Ellison has referred to in part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal particularly with subsections 42(2) and (4) of the Native Title Act. Under the Native Title Bill that was passed through this chamber in the dying days of December last year, we have a very similar provision whereby the minister can intervene and overrule all of the decisions of the courts of Australia and also of the Native Title Tribunal which is established under the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, firstly, to the timing of Malcolm Douglas's announcement of the closure of the crocodile farm. For those who are not aware of it, for a number of years Malcolm Douglas has had a farm located at Broome just a few hundred yards from the Cable Beach Resort in a very good tourist area. Although it is virtually a tourist farm, it is a smaller operation where he has been propagating crocodiles. He makes all of his revenue from the tourist trade which is attracted there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crocodile farm is a very important tourist development for Broome. Broome has some classic features: it has its architecture, the magnificent Cable Beach, the cinema, and a range of activities. It also has a lot of activities related to the Aboriginal culture in the area&mdash;the pearl farming and so forth. But the crocodile farm is a unique and interesting attraction, which I also had the pleasure of visiting, only a day before the closure took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I discussed this matter with Malcolm Douglas on a number of occasions leading up to my recent trip to Broome. Just to inform Senator McKiernan and the Senate, the problem that Malcolm Douglas had was the uncertainty surrounding the title to the land he had obtained where he was hoping to establish the commercial operation. It is at some distance from the crocodile farm itself&mdash;it is about a 15-minute drive across to Roebuck Bay&mdash;and the whole operation relied on propagating thousands of crocodile eggs. The space that he had available at his Cable Beach development was just not enough to allow these crocodiles to be farmed. It is a fairly risky business. Pretty secure fences and good ponds are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of a crocodile farm is something that astounds me. The gentleman who showed me through the development at the Broome crocodile farm at Cable Beach amazed me when he told me that the way they get the crocodile eggs out of the nests is to go in there with a long prod. Of course, the mother of the average of 42 crocodile eggs sitting in a nest at any one time is extremely protective. I would not recommend it to any senator to approach a crocodile nest with a nesting female crocodile on it and try to take the crocodiles out of the nest. It is a very hazardous operation. Apparently, that is what they do: these very skilled and brave people go in there with a long prod, try to get the eggs out of the crocodile's nest and then stick them into the hatchery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I guess that would be enough to discourage a lot of people from seeking employment on a crocodile farm. The problem is that the whole long-term operation of the crocodile farm as a tourist attraction and as an undertaking for creating skins and meat for export depends on space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all fairly fascinating but there is an important consideration not only for Malcolm Douglas's development in Broome but also for all developments anywhere in Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded that people in Victoria often do not think of the consequences of native title because they do not think there is any native title in Victoria. I remember the contribution made by Senator Troeth from Victoria&mdash;who is in the chamber tonight&mdash;during the first debate about the crocodile farm. She revealed, for the first time in Australia, that the Victorian government's titles records show that 34 per cent&mdash;and Senator Troeth will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;of Victoria is available for claim. So Victorians should be very concerned about the native title issue as well. Native title will be an issue in Victoria because 34 per cent of the land in Victoria is available for claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But certainty of title is the crucial issue that we are addressing here tonight. I remind honourable senators that Mr Douglas was given title over the land, as Senator Ellison explained, and was forced no less than three times in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to defend his rights to develop that title. On each occasion the Supreme Court took into consideration a range of views. It took into consideration the views of those who contested an area containing an Aboriginal initiation trail. Basically, a group of Aboriginals have walked across this 40-acre patch of land well described in the records of the Supreme Court and recognised by Malcolm Douglas. There have been a number of investigations by experts from the Western Australia museum&mdash;and I point out to Senator McKiernan that they certainly could not be described as lackeys of the WA government. Following an investigation over seven years, these experts in their field agreed with the Aboriginal people on where this initiation trail ran&mdash;that is, at the back of the block, away from the Great Northern Highway running up to Derby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Douglas excised an enormous tract of land off the back of the 40 acres in total respect of that initiation trail. Taking that into account, the Supreme Court said that it recognised the existence of the initiation track. However, it also said it was fair that development should go ahead near the highway. I remind honourable senators that the Great Northern Highway between Broome and Derby is a major road going up to places like Karratha and Kununurra. Massive road trains run up and down it virtually every half an hour every single day. Of course, that means there is an enormous amount of disruption to that area. The relative disruption to the initiation track caused by a few ponds being placed near that road with a few crocodiles lazing around in the sun would not be anything like the disruption that could possibly be caused by traffic. I would not seek to judge that because I am not competent to judge the importance of Aboriginal culture and the importance of that initiation trail to those who use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Supreme Court made a judgment quite recently that the development should proceed. Effectively, we are talking about excavating some very shallow ponds in a mudflat type country, putting in some cyclone wire fences and putting a couple of small shed-like buildings in place to provide hatcheries and so forth for the crocodiles&mdash;a very low impact development compared with putting a major north-south highway through and allowing road trains to run up and down it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial issue is certainty of title. Turning to the gazettal notice tabled by the clerk today, we note that in schedule 2 the prohibited acts as prescribed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Bulldozing, grading, drilling or excavating, or any other act that will, or is likely to injure or desecrate the area or part of the area described in Schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The deliberate killing, cutting down, damaging or removing any vegetation within the area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Having been there recently, I have to say to the Senate that there is virtually no vegetation in the area. It is a mudflat. There are a few trees along the road, but I suspect that a lot of those trees blew in from passing trucks and have propagated themselves. Certainly, they are not part of the natural vegetation. It really is a mudflat-type situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important issue here is that Malcolm Douglas has not been told he will have his land compulsorily resumed or have some compensation paid because he is not allowed to develop. He is left with this piece of land and with his liabilities in relation to this land. However, he has been told by a federal minister that for the next five years he is not allowed to do anything with the land&mdash;not a thing. I presume that he would have to pay council rates on the land and land taxes. If there were any capital gains, he would probably have to pay capital gains tax to the Commonwealth revenue if he disposed of the land. The land is not being resumed. All we have is a declaration from the federal minister that Mr Douglas, or anyone else, is not allowed to bulldoze the land or remove any vegetation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important part of this is that in Australia, or in any country, if we do not have certainty of title or private property rights protected, then development, which in the end gives hope for jobs for all Australians, will not take place. We cannot hope to increase the number of jobs in Australia unless there is private investment. I think everyone on both sides of the parliament recognises that if we do not have investment&mdash;be it public or private&mdash;we will not have an increase in the number of real jobs. Here we have a man who  has made a significant investment in time and money in a good development project, who has fought through the processes of the law in Western Australia right up to the Supreme Court, and who has won on each occasion. Having done that, he has had this notice placed upon him by Mr Tickner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that angers me more than that is that effectively a one-man tribunal went to Broome to advise the minister. Fred Chaney certainly has experience in Aboriginal affairs, has a deep and active interest in Aboriginal affairs and has an enormous affinity with the Aboriginal people. However, Mr Chaney has gone there and mediated. The parliament does not know whom he has mediated with or spoken with. I am sure that the minister does, but we are not sure whom he spoke to, what discussions took place or whether or not those discussions were recorded. We are none the wiser. He has gone up there as a one-man tribunal and effectively&mdash;even though it was not Fred who did it&mdash;taken evidence without a record that we know of and without representation, as far as we know. We are not sure what rules of evidence he used, but he has made a decision which has gone to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has effectively acted on the advice of a one-man tribunal to overrule the Supreme Court of Western Australia, which made the decisions on three occasions&mdash;not only the Supreme Court of Western Australia but also all of the other bodies under the former Labor government which approved this development. So that undermines certainty of title in the eyes of all in the north of that great state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to something that is even more important in the longer term. Section 42, subsections (2) to (4), of the Native Title Act, which we passed here last year and which was proclaimed on about 31 December or 1 January, refers to the tribunal processes that have to be gone through to achieve a result&mdash;a recommendation that a development either go ahead or not, or that native title be granted or not&mdash;that complex native title tribunal process that we debated for something like 58 hours last December. We are advised that that process will take between 12 or 14 months, if there are no hiccups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to develop or if they are native title claimants, they go to the tribunal. They then go through all of the processes and all of the determinations of the tribunal, which processes take between 12 and 14 months. At the end of that entire process, which the Senate ultimately agreed was fair only five months ago, section 42 contains an absolute, undisputed power for the federal minister to intervene and overrule the decision of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the determination that we are debating tonight is different&mdash;it is under the Heritage Act&mdash;the power is very similar, if not worse, under the Native Title Act. For example, if a mining company were successful in the tribunal process and were allowed to go ahead with its development of a mine, of a tourist operation or whatever, not even the aggrieved Aboriginal group&mdash;the native title party, as it is called under the Native Title Act&mdash;but some other Aboriginal group not even a party to the tribunal process can go to the federal minister and put its case to the minister, and the minister can overrule the decision of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much in parallel with what has taken place under the section 10 determination which we are debating tonight in relation to the Broome crocodile farm. We can go through all the processes under the Native Title Act, but an aggrieved party can go to the minister and the minister has a two month period whereby he can veto the decision of the native title tribunal. That is a totally unfettered power. So, whether it is an Aboriginal group, a developer or any other group that is disaffected by the decision of the tribunal it makes little difference. Under the Native Title Act it is effectively the person or group of people who have the best leverage over the minister or the government of the day who will have ultimate power. Regardless of the 12 or 14 month process of going through the native title tribunal and associated procedures, the minister will make the ultimate decision. This indicates the importance of what Mr Tickner and his so-called mediator, Mr Chaney, have done in the case of the Broome crocodile farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will close with one other reflection on the sad and disgraceful process that took place in relation to the Broome crocodile farm. When I spoke to Malcolm Douglas a couple of weeks before the decision was made I told him that I was going to Broome; I wanted to have a look around; I wanted to get a feel for the issue on the ground; I wanted to understand the layout of the farm and talk to the local community; and, having been there, I wanted to raise some issues publicly. Mr Douglas informed me that, in the interests of mediation, Mr Chaney&mdash;I will be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;requested that there be no comment made to the media. In effect, there was a sort of formal media ban on discussion of issues relating to the crocodile farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not met Malcolm Douglas, but I have spoken to him on the phone on a number of occasions. I have found him to be an ultimately fair man in the dealings I have had with him. He is a very reasonable man; a man who has very good reason to be angry about what has happened to him. He decided to respect Mr Chaney's wishes that there be no discussion in the media about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have been Mr Tickner's idea, but Mr Chaney certainly was the messenger on behalf of Mr Tickner. The very sad thing is that this is a crucial issue in Australia, and a vitally crucial issue in the town of Broome. It is not a big town, and people should have had the right to discuss this matter. Indeed, the public of Australia should have had the right to discuss the sort of things we are talking about tonight. The fact that some sort of mediation process taking place is no reason why the public should not have a right to discuss this matter. Discussion was curtailed by a sort of gentleman's agreement, and that was imposed by either Mr Tickner, Mr Chaney or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite angry about that. In the last few months in Perth and in the rest of Australia the trial of Laurie Connell has been discussed day and night. How one can possibly say that it is OK to discuss Laurie Connell's trial, but not to discuss the important national issues associated with the banning of development of a piece of private property&mdash;a ban imposed by a federal minister who had no previous jurisdiction over land management&mdash;is beyond me. In a democracy it is a disgrace for anyone, either at the request of the minister or off his own bat&mdash;and I refer to Mr Chaney if he made that decision himself&mdash;to suggest that there should be some ban on discussing the very important issues that are encapsulated in the decision to ban development of the Broome crocodile farm. It is a travesty of democracy and a travesty of people's rights to discuss these most important crucial issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing a crucial federal-state relations issue. We now have a junior minister in the federal government being able to ban development on a piece of land in Western Australia on the advice of an unelected mediator. It is a disgraceful decision. It is a disgrace that the federation has come to the point where we have this maniacal power of a centralist federal Labor government being able to overrule all of the due processes taking place in Western Australia. To then ban public discussion and media comment on the Broome crocodile farm is a further travesty of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this Labor government will regret the massive centralisation of power that has occurred in the last 10 years and will live to regret the massive centralisation of power included in the provisions of the heritage act, which we are dealing with tonight, and of course the unconstitutional, unworkable, impractical Native Title Act, which we passed through this parliament in December last year. </PARA>

<PARA>The East Asia Analytical Unit has produced some very good work. Two of its reports are tabled in the Senate today, one with regard to South-East Asia and one with regard to India. The East Asia Analytical Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was first created for the study which we all know as the Garnaut report. Professor Ross Garnaut, having been an Australian economist advising the Australian government, then Ambassador to China and now of course Professor of Economics at the Australian National University, was asked to write a report on the north-east Asian ascendancy in Australia's economic perspective. It is an absolutely fundamental report that gives focus to Australia's continuing opportunities in Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of that study has built up a secretariat which is now known as the East Asia Analytical Unit. In 1992 this unit produced a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's business challenge: South-East Asia in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, which was another useful study of South-East Asia. In 1994 the same unit has produced a study, adding to that 1992 report, about Australian investment in South-East Asia. It looks at the relationship between investment and trade and the chicken and egg elements of those two important economic factors. It chooses its subtitle from the analogy of sailing. It says that there are new winds of growth blowing in Asia, not least in South-East Asia, so we should let Australia change tack and take advantage of the prevailing wind in our neighbourhood. The report is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Changing tack</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Pamela Fayle and those other members of the unit who carried out this study. All who are interested in our economic relations with Asia will want to read the report thoroughly. At the moment Australia's direct investment abroad finds only 4.6 per cent of the total in the ASEAN countries. This figure is growing, and particularly in the later 1980s following a period of relative decline. I am sure that when we look at Australian trade prospects, we will make sure that not only will we focus on our major target area&mdash;China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are sometimes called the East Asian tigers&mdash;but will continue to have as a target South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some patterns of investment now&mdash;indeed increasing investment&mdash;from the tigers into South-East Asia. Last month I visited China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan and had considered discussions with economic ministers in all those areas. I noted in particular that investment to South-East Asia, and to some extent investment here, is not only linked with the new opportunities that are emerging in Indo-China, such as Vietnam, but that the prospects of good returns from investment are being seen by our big neighbours in the far north in terms of our South-East Asian neighbours. </PARA>

<PARA>As I foreshadowed earlier, this is another major report of the East Asia Analytical Unit from within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is essential reading for those of us who want to see Australia take up the opportunities that exist in the Indian subcontinent. Indeed, although this study relates to India, there are some ways in which parallel observations can be made about Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. It is essential in Australia that our priority focus on north east Asia&mdash;Japan, China and the others&mdash;and not be so focused that we ignore our opportunities in South-East Asia, especially in India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be truly said that 1986 was a year of renaissance in the relationship between Australia and India. Indeed, it was largely driven at first by prime ministers Rajiv Gandhi and Bob Hawke. They understood each other and moved to ensure that our economies were related and our businessmen increasingly got to know each other. Therefore, in 1986 a start was made in Australia to look towards India, after a gap of some 15 years from 1971 to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In due course this led to interest in the parliament, and other senators&mdash;including the current Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan&mdash;joined with me in suggesting that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade write a study on Australia's economic relations with India and the opportunities there. This was a major report of the Senate which was taken up by the government of Australia, was much read in India and was a consolidation of where we had moved from 1986 to 1989. Things languished a little after that, however, and this report is a response by the Australian government through the East Asia Analytical Unit to a Garnaut-type report&mdash;the kind of report that we saw as so valuable for east Asia&mdash;being applied to south Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate report actually called for this report to be written. Subsequently, when it was not immediately activated, I wrote to the then Minister for Trade, Senator Cook, last year and urged that this report be undertaken. He was very kind to write back to me in June of last year to say that my letter had added to the burden of urgings which was leading him to make the decision that he in fact announced in last year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to commend Meredith Borthwick and the other members of the unit and also those from the Australian National University, WD Scott International, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Curtin University.

They are all acknowledged on page xi of the prefatory pages for their contribution to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study focuses upon a new `epochal change', as they put it, in 1991 when India fell into a hole with some international debt. The economic answer for this within India was to become internationally competitive and to have economic liberalisation. This built on the perspectives that we had analysed in the Senate report of 1989. I commend chapter five which talks about that change and the concluding chapter, `Seizing the moment: Australia's India strategy', which is full of paragraphs which I have ticked. I will study the full body of this report thoroughly, and I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

In this age of political correctness that is probably not a sensible thing to say, so I hasten to add that I am not here to defend Nazi war criminals.

But I do speak as someone who is very concerned about what I regard as a deplorable waste of taxpayers' money through this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly raise this matter as a South Australian senator, given that all three ultimate prosecutions were of South Australians whom I represent. In terms of the cost of this exercise, which is really the pertinent point of my comments, this report itself notes that from 1987 to 1992&mdash;the years covered by the report&mdash;salaries were of the order of $6 million and administrative expenses were of the order of $9.3 million. So for this special investigations unit we are talking about an expenditure of $15.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this report does not go into the actual legal costs incurred in the prosecutions themselves. I gather the advice we have from the AG's department is that we are talking about a total expenditure of $30 million on this exercise. As a representative of the taxpayers in this place I want to point to the significant lack of achievement as a result of this expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of four cases were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions from this five-year exercise; only three prosecutions were commenced after all this effort, and the three prosecutions involved three old men living in South Australia. All three prosecutions ultimately failed. In the first case the Supreme Court of South Australia acquitted the defendant, in the second case the charges were dismissed by a magistrate and, in the third case, the charges were dropped by the DPP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, South Australians, more than anybody else in Australia, were the people most exposed to this federal government fiasco. Every day we had one and a half million South Australians watching this fiasco. And South Australians across all walks of life were very angry when they saw, daily, this waste of their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It staggers me that anyone could think that, after nearly 50 years, justice could be done in this area or that successful prosecutions could ever hope to be completed. We all wish that World War II criminals had been dealt with at the time, and dealt with satisfactorily, but the fact is that we were talking about bringing these prosecutions nearly 50 years after the event. It is no wonder that ordinary Australian taxpayers thought that this was the craziest waste of money they had ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the ordinary taxpayers' point of view, Canberra comes up with some amazing ways to waste money, but this really took the cake. Ordinary South Australians in particular who were going about their business were seeing old men dragged before the courts and prosecuted for things done 50 years ago. There was never any hope of getting satisfactory evidence or of satisfactory justice being done. And of course those South Australians concerned about the waste of money were ultimately proved right in that every prosecution brought failed. As the report itself notes on page 5:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many investigations were finally abandoned even though the allegations appeared to have substance. This was either because the suspect had died, before or during investigation, or because important witnesses had disappeared or died.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, what on earth did the government expect? We could have told it this would be the case before this was ever launched and before we wasted $30 million of taxpayers' money. The community has every right to be very angry about the waste of this money which this report documents. I hope that it will never be repeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this motion put by Senator Minchin. I agree with every word he said about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the investigations of war criminals in Australia</EMPHASIS>. Not only could this have been foreseen; it was foreseen. Along with colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, I remember saying in this chamber that this would be the likely outcome if we were to adopt the war crimes legislation that was then being debated. Not only those of us from South Australia and from the Liberal Party but also the opposition generally had the view&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Crowley that former senator Peter Baume, my very good friend, had enormous tussles of conscience about this matter. He did not see it as a perfect piece of legislation. He shared the kinds of criticisms which I am about to touch on for half a minute. Because of his personal associations with so many in the Australian community who had directly suffered through the Nazi holocaust, we all understood the personal position he adopted towards this legislation. But we said then that not only was the bill 50 years out of date in terms of any action to be taken in a court&mdash;and how could that be tested properly&mdash;but also we said it was retrospective and discriminatory because it specified particular years in one theatre of war, that is, Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said, `Bring us a bill with similar principles which is only prospective, which is universal in its reach and we will consider amending the particular clauses to make war crimes unlawful for any theatre in any country for anyone who resides in Australia from this day forth.' I can remember sitting in the chair behind me and putting that speech about this bill and predicting that we would have this kind of end result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Minchin's speech tonight on this report is entirely apt and accurate. There have been no prosecutions, and there has been enormous expense to the taxpayer. We ought not to be ever swayed by our own sensitivity to those in our community who suffered directly as a result of such terrible events in the Second World War. Our sympathy is always with them. The holocaust was terrible, but we will not allow just that thought to convince us to go ahead with something which is otherwise not able to be supported, even on the grounds of retrospectivity alone. I support the remarks of my colleague from South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I rise tonight is that some news came to my attention today that disturbed me somewhat. I was a member of a recent delegation to Bougainville that was led by Senator Loosley and included the Hon. Ian Sinclair, Senator Vicki Bourne and the honourable member for Gilmore, Peter Knott. I remember very well the first day we arrived on Buka Island. We were welcomed by a normal sing-sing and friendly greeting by the locals. We then proceeded to have public hearings in the guesthouse where we were staying. While we were having the sing-sing and a midday lunch of smoked fish in banana leaves&mdash;I believe that is the local food&mdash;I was approached by an elderly man who seemed quite sprightly for his age. He introduced himself as Sir Paul Lapun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turns out that Sir Paul Lapun was a member of Somare's government. He was a member for 10 years and was a minister for mines. He was largely responsible for looking after the mineral wealth of Papua New Guinea and retaining mineral rights for the local landholders. I was told that Sir Paul Lapun is a very well-respected former member for South Bougainville. He may have been one of those people who thought that secession was the way to go in Bougainville in the early days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence he gave us when he addressed our hearing he commented that when the Papua New Guinea defence forces withdrew from Bougainville in 1990 the BRA rebels had the opportunity to show the rest of the world just what they were about. In fact, they chose to rape, pillage, burn and destroy the beautiful paradise of which he was so proud. He made the point that they had had their chance and they blew it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disturbed today to see a radio report from the ABC reporter Sean Dorney, who I had the pleasure of meeting when we were in PNG, that Sir Paul, his wife and daughter were bashed by 15 BRA rebels who ransacked his house in the belief that our delegation had given Sir Paul 30,000 kina, which amounts to $45,000. Why those rebels would believe this, I do not know. But, at any rate, 15 rebels raided Sir Paul's house, bashed his wife, bashed him&mdash;a man in his late 70s, I suspect&mdash;and burnt his house to the ground. Sir Paul has now had to take refuge in one of the care centres in the west of Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have been an unintended consequence of our delegation's visit there. On the other hand, it draws attention to the confidence we came back with, and the hope for the future that we have as a delegation and which those people who have contacted me since have. I have had a lot of correspondence. In fact, just today I received a very good briefing paper from the Catholic bishops on Bougainville who largely supported the views that I have. No doubt our committee report will come to the parliament in the near future through the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened a few days ago with these supposed BRA rebels&mdash;I suspect that they may have been terrorists who were acting under the umbrella of the BRA but, nevertheless, it certainly was not the PNG defence forces who perpetrated this atrocity&mdash;has not only highlighted the fragility of any peace moves that may be made in Bougainville but it also highlights the fact that it is not going to be easy to broker peace in that particular place. I put on record that I feel very sad about what has happened to Sir Paul. I found him to be a delightful character. I just hope that he recovers from his injuries quickly and that he and his family can restore their life and home as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Both the present and previous chief executives are mentioned in the Annual Report. The financial statements are in fact signed by Mr C Mills, the Acting Controller until 27 October 1993. However, as Mr Mills had left the Mint before the Annual Report was finalised and printed, it was only appropriate that the report be signed and forwarded to the Treasurer by the newly incumbent Controller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A version of the report was in the final stages of preparation for printing (ie formatting and filming of the text) but had not been sent to the printers as at 31 October 1993. With modern technology, the printers are only involved at the final production stage. However, the report was not complete as it had not received the required Treasury clearance. (The Mint is part of the Department of the Treasury and is responsible to the Secretary of the Department through the Financial Institutions Division.)  Treasury clearance of the report was provided on 8 November 1993, subject to a number of amendments to the draft, including the need to give recognition to the new Controller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The simplified structure set out on page 10 of the report was designed to give up to date information about key areas of responsibility and lines of accountability in the Mint. This approach was adopted because the annual report is used as a reference document after publication. The structure depicted at page 10, which represented a rationalisation of the old senior management structure, was recommended following a review of the administrative structure of the Mint undertaken by a joint Treasury/Mint staff working party during 1992/93. The new structure was endorsed, in principle, by the Secretary to the Treasury on 14 October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As noted in response to question (2), the earlier version of the report had progressed to the final proof stage by 31 October 1993. To take account of Treasury's amendments, some changes to layout and text were required, as well as the preparation of some new film.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the task force investigating the proposed corporatisation of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation (QIDC), which has indicated that it is seeking Federal Reserve Bank scrutiny over the corporatised QIDC and which also maintains that it may be necessary for the QIDC to gain a banking licence to be able to have this Reserve Bank scrutiny:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Has the Queensland Treasury or an associated body been in contact with the Reserve Bank or other appropriate federal bodies for the purpose of inquiring towards Reserve Bank scrutiny of the QIDC.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, as noted in the answer to the Senator's Question No. 1193, the Reserve Bank has held preliminary discussions with the Queensland Treasury and QIDC, to explore what would be involved in bringing QIDC under Reserve Bank supervision as recommended by the Queensland Government's Working Party on Corporatisation of QIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Reserve Bank would not be prepared to supervise QIDC unless it was subject to the Banking Act of the Commonwealth. This would not necessarily entail the granting of a banking authority under Section 9 of that Act; a company could be brought within the provisions of the Act by listing in Section 5. It would be necessary for a State Government to refer its powers over State banking to the Commonwealth before a State-owned institution could be made subject to the Banking Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The Queensland Government has, however, indicated that following corporatisation it wishes QIDC to be subject to supervision by the Reserve Bank or the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) It is not sensible to speculate on what conditions might be imposed on a body which, to date, has not submitted an application for recognition under the Banking Act. Banking authorities granted in recent years have contained two standard conditions, viz:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the body corporate shall, upon request made at any time by the Reserve Bank of Australia, consult with the Reserve Bank in relation to the making or variation of arrangements for the prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank of the banking business carried on by the body corporate;</PARA>
