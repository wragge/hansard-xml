<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Last September, the minister was directed by the Full Bench of the Federal Court to reconsider an application by Mr David Irving for a visitor's visa to Australia. I ask: has the minister made a decision on this matter? If so, can the minister inform the Senate of that decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that I have made a decision on the application by Mr David Irving for a visa to visit Australia. As honourable senators would be aware, this matter dates back to December 1992 when Mr Irving applied for a visitor's visa to Australia to promote his latest books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 February 1993 my predecessor, Mr Gerry Hand, rejected Mr Irving's application on the grounds that Mr Irving was likely to become involved in activities disruptive to the Australian community or a group within the Australian community. An appeal by Mr Irving against Mr Hand's decision was dismissed in the Federal Court on 13 May 1993. However, the Full Bench of the Federal Court upheld Mr Irving's appeal and ordered that that decision be set aside and the matter be returned to me for a fresh determination. That is the order to which Senator Carr refers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have decided to reject Mr Irving's application on the basis that he does not meet the public interest criteria of good character in the migration regulations as they were at the time of Mr Hand's decision. As honourable senators will also be aware, new migration regulations came into effect on 1 February 1993. I was required to review this application under the regulations in effect at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations enable a range of conduct to be taken into account when assessing a person's character, such as a person's past conduct. They also prescribe a number of matters which deem a person not to be of good character; for example, a deportation order or an exclusion from another country for national security reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Irving was deported from Canada in November 1992 and remains inadmissible to that country. In 1993 he was excluded from Germany. Moreover, both the adjudicator of the Canadian immigration inquiry before which he appeared and the judge of the British High Court of Justice in another case earlier this year expressed doubts about the veracity of evidence he had presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back to the decision: having rejected Mr Irving on character grounds, I am not required to consider the question of whether or not a visit by Mr Irving would be disruptive to the Australian community or a group within the Australian community. I was required under the former migration regulations to consider a waiver of the good character requirement if a person failed to meet the public interest criteria only on the basis that that person was deemed not to be of good character. While I was not required to consider the waiver in this case, I have decided in any event that Mr Irving has not reformed for the purposes of the waiver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a second application about which honourable senators may have read in the media last year. Mr Irving made an application on 3 June 1993 to visit Australia. An assessment of good character was also required for this second application under the current migration legislation. This application has also been rejected. The same facts were relevant to both applications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the Prime Minister's 1993 election campaign pledge that a $130 billion investment avalanche was about to come on stream. If this was the case then, why one year later do we need an employment, industry and regional statement and yet another recycled infrastructure bond scheme to set the direction of the Australian economy? If last year's promise can be so cynically and casually broken, why should anyone believe tomorrow's promise will be any better?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sometimes avalanches are a little slow to get started. There is no doubt that the investment side of the economy has been a little bit disappointing. But conditions are now unequivocally favourable for recovery in business investment. The profit share has recovered. That reflects continuing moderation in wages growth and improvements in productivity. Official interest rates are now at their lowest levels for 20 years. Inflation is so low that those opposite are just eating their hearts out every time they see those low figures released. There have been very solid gains in productivity&mdash;something like a 30 per cent increase over the last 10 years. Consumer confidence is as high as it has ever been and demand growth is extremely robust. We have achieved extraordinarily large gains in international competitiveness and our export performance over the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business surveys that have been consistently released in recent times point not only to a continuation of favourable conditions for business investment but to a high level of confidence and a high level of investment intentions and expectations that will unquestionably start flowing through into the economy as a whole in the not too distant future. We hope it will be sooner rather than later. We have made that hope very clear; we have made that expectation very clear. But lag times and lead times in this business are always very hard to predict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the further contribution that we will be making to robust economic growth and the long-term sustained health of the Australian economy, as set out in the statement tomorrow, will add further to that favourable climate for investment. I think any business decision maker who does not take advantage of this particular climate will have simply lost the entrepreneurial instinct that is absolutely crucial if this economy is to continue to grow and this nation is to prosper. It is over to them. They have the responsibility, they have the opportunity and it is about time they took advantage of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has presented us with a whole lot of information but he has conveniently ignored the fact that this $130 billion of investment that was promised has not occurred. He talks about lag times. There was no mention of lag times 12 months or so ago when the Prime Minister made this promise. Where is the $130 billion of investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was plenty of mention about lag times when that figure was indicated last year. That was the investment decision making in the pipeline of which we were aware. A lot of it, necessarily, was going to take a long time to be realised in practice. These were plans and proposals of which we had knowledge. Most of those projects, to the extent that they have not already been started, are still very much in the pipeline. They are awaiting the decision to go. A lot of other investments are stored up as well. The taxation regime, which I also should have mentioned, is extremely favourable now and dramatically comparable to the kind of tax regime in company tax terms that Senator Chapman is proposing for the Australian business community. Every single condition that I have mentioned is converging favourably now for the business community. I repeat that if it does not take advantage of this chance, it will be missing a very spectacular opportunity for business growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is clearly much to the disappointment of people such as Senator Macdonald who are still living in the past. He has a very considerable memory of how long his party resisted this process of change. Honourable senators will be aware that last night, on behalf of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela claimed victory&mdash;and that victory was conceded by President de Klerk, on behalf of the National Party. The Prime Minister today sent messages of congratulations and best wishes to both Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Africa owes an enormous debt to the vision and integrity of Nelson Mandela who, as we all know, in 27 years of imprisonment maintained his steadfast commitment to the creation of a non-racial democratic society for all South Africans. He did so, as became abundantly clear upon his release, with a spirit of dignity, reconciliation and forgiveness towards his captors and persecutors that should make us all enormously proud that such a human response is still possible on this planet. It is an extraordinary personal achievement for Mr Mandela to have seen this process through in the way he has. He deserves the enormous respect of all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say that the new South Africa that we are seeing born in this way would not have been possible without the realism and determination of F.W. de Klerk who did, so courageously, make the break with the past. These elections have marked the end of an enormous number of years of injustice and racial oppression in South Africa. The elections, despite some obvious problems in administration, were conducted in an overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic atmosphere. In the face of violence and extremism for them to have gone off as well as they have is a really outstanding achievement for the South African people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new South African government faces enormous challenges in redressing the social and economic inequalities of apartheid. The new government first has to curb the endemic violence and assert its authority throughout the country, and do so by securing the effective cooperation of the police and the defence forces. That may not prove to be easy in the job that lies ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also, obviously, resolve the problems that still exist in KwaZulu and Natal. It has to, above all else, attempt the excruciatingly difficult task of maintaining economic growth and attracting foreign investment while, at the same time, undertaking the massive housing, education, health and other infrastructure projects that are necessary to redress the legacies of apartheid. If there is any basic problem that is going to be experienced over the period immediately ahead, it is pretty obviously the enormous expectations that have been generated among the black African people and the difficulty that any government is going to have in satisfying them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without exaggerating the importance of the Australian contribution, we can be proud of the role that we played in the ending of apartheid. For many years, Australian governments and many individual Australians have worked towards this objective. There is little doubt that the sanctions policies pursued by successive Australian governments&mdash;first of all as to sports with the Gleneagles Agreement back in 1977, for which Malcolm Fraser deserves thanks and congratulations; then the trade and investment sanctions from 1985 onwards; the financial sanctions in the late 1980s; and the strategy of phased reduction of sanctions that we led the way on in 1991&mdash;have all been enormously important in showing the way not only for the Commonwealth but also, in many instances, for the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have helped in other ways with the transition to democracy by democratic capacity building in the period leading up to the elections.

It is located on land of the Australian Capital Territory and its removal, therefore, is a question for the ACT government. We understand that the ACT government has plans to remove the shed and to replace it with a commemorative plaque and garden.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I remind the minister that the government has reportedly described $386 million of outstanding HECS debts as `doubtful debts'. I ask: does this term imply that the government regards students&mdash;the borrowers&mdash;as defaulters, that they have done something wrong, and that the government is therefore justified in pursuing them? Is the minister concerned that it is women who are less likely to repay their  HECS debts because they cannot get jobs at the rate of pay which is the minimum repayment threshold? Will the government revise the assumptions upon which this inequitable scheme is based? Further, can the government rule out any reduction in this year's budget of the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their HECS debts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that the assumption in Senator Bell's question about the validity of HECS is wrong. The Australian Government Actuary report which the press has quoted was commissioned by the Department of Employment, Education and Training in mid-1993. The actuary reported his findings in August 1993 and an estimate of the amount of HECS debt unlikely to be recovered, drawn from the actuary's report, was included in DEET's annual report for 1992-93. Although the government would prefer to recoup all HECS debts, the proportion of debt estimated to be irrecoverable is considered modest, given the nature of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When HECS was introduced in 1989 it was estimated that up to 30 per cent of the debt would not be recovered. Up until DEET commissioned the government's actuary study, insufficient numbers of students had completed their university education and reached the scheme's minimum income threshold for repayment to allow this estimate to be verified. The full value of HECS debts will not be recovered because of an equity feature of the scheme, namely, that individuals are not required to make repayments through the taxation system unless their taxable income in a year reaches an indexed minimum. For 1994 that indexed minimum was $26,403. This is important in ensuring that anyone who has little or no capacity to pay is not required to do so&mdash;those in lowly paid or part-time employment; people who have become unemployed or leave the work force voluntarily&mdash;for example, for child rearing; and people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise to Senator Bell that, from the very beginning of HECS, it was the government's plan that there would be people who would not pay HECS because they did not reach the minimum level of income, which is $26,000. At the moment, according to the actuary's report, some people have not reached that level, but it is nowhere near the 30 per cent that was first estimated when HECS was introduced. The HECS scheme is working very well. Senator Bell raised a question about what is in the budget. I think he will have to wait until next week to find out whether his curiosity about HECS in the budget is met.</PARA>

Why change this in-built threshold equity at all?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the Senate that these very toxic chemicals will not be used in Australia in significant amounts for very much longer. The use of organochlorines, principally heptachlor and chlordane, for termite control in and around houses and buildings will be phased out in all states and territories, with the exception of the Northern Territory, by June next year. This decision was taken in Hobart last week at the meeting of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. This council comprises federal and state ministers responsible for agriculture in Australia and New Zealand. This decision will produce a 95 per cent reduction in organochlorine use in Australia within the next 12 months. Import levels, which I license, will be reduced immediately so that stocks are exhausted within that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Council did agree to the continuation of the phase-out in the Northern Territory until June 1997. This, of course, was to acknowledge the significance of the termite problems in the Northern Territory. However, this concession was subject to the Northern Territory government introducing a range of very important compliance measures. These include a strengthening of the audit of organochlorine sales and use, and increased environmental monitoring of the use of organochlorines. A number of additional controls are to be placed on the availability and use of heptachlor and chlordane during the phase-out period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of chlordane is the last remaining widespread application of these major organochlorines for termite control in Australia, although there is still a continued use for a short time of heptachlor for the control of funnel ant in sugarcane plantations in Far North Queensland. That is now the only remaining agricultural use for these chemicals allowed in Australia, and that will also be phased out in December of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will be aware, this is an important issue because organochlorines were at the centre of the beef residue crisis in Australia in 1987&mdash;and, I might add, that is not very long ago. That particular crisis cost the industry $46 million to clean up and caused significant damage to our reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mindful of this and of recent residue issues, the council expressed its support for work being conducted on a strategic plan for control of residues in the beef cattle industry. The plan has been formulated by an industry-led residue management group which is chaired Mr Keith Lawson of Australian Meat Holdings. Council expressed its total support for the plan to ensure that Australia's reputation as an exporter of clean food is not jeopardised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories would be aware that the Queensland Premier recently announced that his government would develop a detailed plan for the future ownership and management of the Starcke land holdings. But Mr Goss has said that his excellent initiative was partly conditional on the federal government matching Queensland funding of $2 million for acquisition of the property, based on the Queensland government's valuation of $4.25 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to inform the Senate that my department will contribute $1 million towards the acquisition of Starcke. In fact, just this morning I signed a letter to Premier Goss outlining my intention in this matter. When combined with a further $1 million to be provided by ATSIC, the federal government contribution will match the Queensland government funding, making purchase of the property possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those in the Senate who do not know of Starcke, it is a 220,000-hectare property with a coastline that stretches over about 140 kilometres of Cape York. The property has exceptional conservation and wilderness values and represents one of the most diverse ecosystems on Cape York. It is also an extremely precious piece of land, of course, to the traditional owners there. Indeed, I think that Starcke should be held up to the whole of Australia as a landmark example of how state and federal governments can work in cooperation with traditional owners and conservationists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commonwealth first considered the Starcke acquisition, we said that any contribution of Commonwealth funds would be conditional upon the agreement of and approval by traditional owners, as well as the protection of conservation values. Our conditions have been met, and we are delighted to participate in this acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made it clear to Premier Goss that the Commonwealth funding is conditional upon the Queensland government providing adequate safeguards which protect both environmental and Aboriginal interests. I am determined that there will not be any adverse environmental impacts arising out of mining projects in Starcke's resource reserve. Commonwealth involvement in Starcke will ensure that protection of one of the largest coastal wilderness areas on the east coast of Australia is preserved. This is an agreement which has satisfied the Queensland government, the traditional owners, the conservation movement and also, of course, the Commonwealth. I think that is something that many would have thought was impossible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1992 DEET established four prevention units to identify fraud, to investigate cases, and to promote risk assessment and fraud control action plans across labour market programs. Concurrently, internal audit activity on these programs was increased. As a result, improved program guidelines have been introduced, contracts with providers have been strengthened, computer system controls tightened and risk assessments recently completed as a basis for developing fraud control action plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are producing results. Since 1992 around 200 cases of alleged fraud&mdash;of an estimated value of $2 million&mdash;in labour market programs have been dealt with or are currently being investigated.

In responding to that representation, I am advised that former Senator Richardson informed the Northern Territory Environment Centre that Mount Isa Mines was complying with the foreign investment conditions, that no breaches had occurred and that no review of the barge loading operation was necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman has had a longstanding interest in the automobile industry in Australia and is one of the few senators in this chamber who have pursued these interests assiduously. I am pleased to say that the automotive industry is continuing to improve its overall competitiveness as a result of its restructuring under the Button car plan. The industry's strong performance in 1993 is particularly welcome, given the reduction in consumer demand over the last two or three years. It has been achieved as a result of a stronger focus on export for this industry, and that is a very pleasing thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the facts include a 17 per cent improvement in productivity, which brings the improvements in productivity for the automotive industry in Australia for the last two years to 31 per cent, an outstanding performance; an increase in total vehicle sales to about 555,000 units in 1993 compared with 515,000 in 1991; an increase in passenger motor vehicle sales, including sales of locally produced models; and, importantly, an increase in automotive exports to almost $1.5 billion last year compared with $1.3 billion the year before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good export results encompass both cars and components and reflect our increasing access to major automotive industries not only in Asia but also, importantly, in Europe, in the United States of America and in Japan itself. We are in Australia developing a world-class industry as the differential in quality of locally made models compared to imports continues to narrow, a point that the Prime Minister stressed yesterday when he saw on its way to South Korea the two-millionth motor engine produced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment levels in the industry have also stabilised, as they have in component manufacturing centres, with a loss of employment in 1993 of 2.4 per cent compared with almost seven per cent in 1992 and 27 per cent in 1991. It is true that the profitability performance of the industry needs to improve. It is also important to realise that the industry is emerging from the impact of the recession and that substantial restructuring has taken place, to place companies in a better position for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this vein, it is particularly pleasing that future investment for this industry is projected to increase by almost $2 billion over the next three years, an increase of four per cent over the period 1990-93. Substantial commitments have also been made by car companies that will ensure that an Australian manufacturing capability to supply both domestic and export markets continues into the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that the outlook for the industry in 1994 is positive in terms of projected sales, local production and exports, as well as other performance factors such as productivity, profitability and quality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asked how this stands with ALP policy. Of course, ALP policy requires the government to hold 51 per cent of Limited shares.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering the questions that have been posed to me by Senator Spindler, it is necessary to go back to 1983. In 1983 the government deregulated financial institutions in Australia. As a consequence of that, we created a stronger market for investment and development finance and there is now in existence a number of well-known banks&mdash;BT, Schroders, Citibank, Macquarie Bank and so on&mdash;that provide finance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the AIDC was floated and 19.4 per cent sold off, and that is AIDC Ltd. Since then, it has been functioning as any other commercial bank&mdash;or any other commercial financial institution, I should say, to be precise. It has been doing so in competition with some of the other institutions I have mentioned, but with the advantages of a government guarantee, a point that has been made to us from time to time. It has been acting purely commercially. It has not been providing special funding for small to medium companies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Spindler sees the industry statement tomorrow, I am sure he will see that we have tackled that issue, in all of its complexity, in greater detail. The AIDC has certainly not been doing that; it has been hunting at the big end of town and investing commercially in major propositions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his question, Senator Spindler asked me about the Australian Submarine Corporation. The AIDC does have a shareholding in that corporation, but it has it on a commercial basis; it does not have it on the basis that we needed to make an investment for some national interest function. If there are issues of national interest, they will be raised with the government through the AIDC itself, the premier entity, which will remain in full government ownership, and will be dealt with in that context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that, in light of this explanation, the honourable senator's announced opposition to any legislation on this might now dissolve and that he will recognise the changes that have occurred since banking deregulation and the need no longer for a government to hold ownership of, and to maintain a guarantee to, an institution such as the AIDC. We have indeed a deeper and richer financial market now than we had before; and the institutions that are there are capable of answering the problem, subject to the changes we will make for small to medium companies in that area of finance access.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indian government has been very courageous in its economic reforms, and the prospects are that as a consequence of those reforms there will be a substantial degree of economic growth in that already very large economy. When one gets projections of economic growth of six per cent plus in an economy the size of India's, with a middle class of 120 million people already, one realises that one is creating new demand of enormous proportions and, therefore, an opportunity for Australia and Australian business to succeed and to make significant increases in our trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In launching that report, the ambition we have set for ourselves&mdash;which I think is a legitimate one and which is raised in the report&mdash;is to take our current share of three per cent of India's total imports and raise it to 3.5 per cent over the next five years. That does not sound like a big increase, but one should realise that it is a proposal at a time when it is expected that India's imports will double, with the growth being emphasised in areas that are not Australia's traditional strengths in its trade with India. So we will need to work very hard to achieve that objective but, if we do, Australia's exports to India will increase by more than $1 billion in that five-year period. That is the magnitude of the potential that exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The launch of the report highlighting that significant aspect fits in very well with the potential trade opportunities not just in India, but in the Indian Ocean region. It reflects the need for us to look west across the Indian Ocean in our trade policy and promotion efforts, not just to India and the subcontinent but to the Middle East and Africa, particularly southern Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean we should shift our focus away from north and South-East Asia, an area of our economic activity that we have given so much attention to, because that will remain our most significant trading relationship, but it is an important and new area of attention. India is at the centre of this region&mdash;it is the most powerful economy in the region&mdash;and it has emerging demands for infrastructure projects, telecommunications, processed foods and a wide range of services to which Australian business has the capacity effectively to contribute. If we can achieve our objectives, I think we will make a very substantial contribution to our economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important for Western Australia. One-third of our exports to India now are sourced from Western Australia. The commercial relationship between India and WA is solid and in good shape. The report recommended the identification of Perth as the gateway to India. While it is not for the government to determine what is the gateway to India and which companies should operate and focus on which markets, the opening up of the Indian Ocean and the Indian Ocean trade links and the recognition of Australia as a two-ocean nation&mdash;which is too often underestimated&mdash;is a very important opportunity for Western Australia. With trade missions, seminars and other promotions, the government has every intention of seeking to give priority to this Indian Ocean region as a new element in our strategy. It has every intention of encouraging all Australian businesses, particularly those with a western orientation, to focus on the potential there. It has an enormous capacity to contribute to our overall trade balance and our economic success.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Australia has more than a billion dollars of bilateral trade. They are trade partners of importance to Australia. Their senior leaders and decision makers, in both the public and the private sector, from time to time need to have their focus on Australia raised so that we are at the forefront of their thinking in some of the planning. For example, I think the potential for Australia to provide educational services&mdash;particularly higher educational services&mdash;is significantly underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents and governments in that area think first and foremost of the United States and the United Kingdom for English language tertiary education for their children. They are looking for an alternative. We raised with the minister for higher education in Saudi Arabia and with the relevant authorities in the United Arab Emirates the importance and potential of Australia. That has the capacity directly to be a trade benefit because of the commercial benefit that flows. More importantly, it will be a contributor to the long-term relationship between Australia and the region as senior private and public sector representatives who originally were educated in Australia begin to play a significant role in their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident in many other countries in our region that that investment years ago&mdash;from the Colombo Plan right through to contemporary support which has been bipartisan in its nature over the years&mdash;has made a significant contribution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Campbell this day, relating to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA>This is only a relatively minor issue, but it really shows the hypocrisy of this government when it was in full flight trying to get the Native Title Bill through this place before Christmas. One part of the strategy was to ensure that the Senate committee system did not properly deal with that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Green senators in particular were very concerned about a number of aspects of that bill and that, right up until the last minute, they were deciding&mdash;and I give full faith to their consideration of this&mdash;whether or not that bill should have been sent to a committee before it got into this place for that debate. I know that Senator Chamarette wanted the opportunity for the committee to move around and to take evidence from a wide range of Aboriginal organisations. Indeed, Senator Chamarette moved a motion in the Senate long before the Native Title Bill was introduced to allow Aboriginal elders to come before the bar of the Senate. That shows her bona fides in wanting to see proper consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A way of ensuring that that did not take place and that the government's agenda to get the Native Title Bill through the Senate occurred was, indeed, to set up the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. It is stated in the bill&mdash;I think it is in section 42; my colleague Senator Ellison might remind me whether that is correct or not&mdash;that the establishment of that committee was required to be as soon as practicable after the proclamation of the legislation, which I think was on the last day of December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agitated through informal channels to ensure that that native title committee was set up in February. We did it through the whips. We were told that it was on the minister's desk and that it was going to be done. Week after week went by. Finally, on Wednesday, I think, just before Senator Gareth Evans flew overseas, I had to go through the process of basically forcing the issue through giving notice of a motion in this place. Finally the government acted. Senator Evans said that there had been a whole load of technical, administrative and legal reasons&mdash;the Sir Humphrey Appleby defence about why things do not get done by government&mdash;as to why that committee had not been set up. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a good try. The reality was that the government did not really want this committee set up for as long as possible. In good faith, Senator Evans and the  government made sure that they appointed their members to the committee in the Senate. We did the same. We went through a rigorous ballot process. Senator Ellison and I kept out all other opponents and were elected to the committee. The Democrats and the Greens had to work out who was going to go on the committee. I believe Senator Kernot was successful in that negotiation. In the House of Representatives, the coalition appointed Mr Reith and Mr McGauran.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, it was in the government's interest not to appoint anyone because then the committee could not be established, it could not set up a secretariat, it could not get on with the job of overseeing the implementation of the Native Title Act and the setting up of the tribunal&mdash;which opened in Perth recently&mdash;and the very important work of the parliament seeing the implementation of the Native Title Act, which ever way we look at the Native Title Act, could not be achieved. It is a matter that deserves the focus of the people of Australia because it shows the rhetoric of this government, in relation to the commitments it made during the Native Title Bill debate, is not matched with its actions. If the rhetoric on a whole range of other issues&mdash;which I know are matters close to the hearts of people like Senator Chamarette and the Democrats&mdash;is not carried through, then the situation will become a total farce and the many promises that were made during that debate, and all of the negotiations leading up to the bill coming into this chamber, will show the hypocrisy of the government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, Mr President, that it was very hard for the government to establish a joint committee which, as you know from your own experience, is not a complicated thing. It involves a couple of quite standard notices coming into this place and put through the other place and the establishment of a secretariat.

The reality is that the government has established the tribunal, it has set up its office in Perth and it has appointed the president, Justice French. It has done all of those things, but it is still not capable of establishing the joint committee. I think the government deserves to be condemned for its failure. It is thumbing its nose at the parliament. If it wants some goodwill for native title, it should not play games like this. But the government is showing that it is prepared to play games with it.

I can recall the emotional debate that went on in this chamber and the fact that the press gallery, and other people, stood and cheered the passing of this legislation in the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that in the House of Representatives our colleagues are so enthusiastic about participating in the work of the committee that it has been impossible to reach agreement so far about which of the many potential entrants into this particular exercise should have the guernsey.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I should make the point, finally, that the purpose of the committee was to monitor the implementation of the Native Title Act. It is, of course, the case that the act has not gone very far down the track in terms of actual implementation at this stage, although the tribunal, of course, has been established and offices have been open to receive applications since the beginning of the year. Only a handful of applications, understandably, have so far been made. No decisions have been made pursuant to the legislation. So there is really not much at this stage for the committee to monitor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to pick up on the question that has been raised by Senator Tierney. He seems to have stretched the string to his bow across a much wider range of problems with regard to DEET and its administration of employment funding programs. He raised a matter with regard to the jobstart program. People are put on the program, and there are guidelines. I think Senator Tierney is aware that those programs are reviewed, that there is some checking but that because of the sheer magnitude of the programs and the number of employers involved it would be impossible to check each and every one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite adopt a hypocritical stance. They come into this chamber and take some political opportunistic approach. But at the same time as doing that, they question the government about reducing expenditure in some of these departments. There is a big difference between CES and DEET. DEET has the responsibility of providing a program to an employer. Industrial matters between employees and employers are the concern of the Department of Industrial Relations. All employees, whether they be under jobstart programs or just under general awards, have the right to go to the Department of Industrial Relations to lodge a complaint and have their complaint dealt with in the correct manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two different issues here. One issue relates to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and employers, and the other issue relates to employers and employees. Those opposite have suddenly become the disciples of concern for employees. In its strategy at the last election the opposition was looking at a $3 an hour youth wage. The opposition was going to have a free employment market where workers would have to go out and bid for their jobs. What sort of protection was the opposition going to provide? None! Senator Schacht's answer was correct: Senator Tierney needs to get his facts straight and deal with the two questions in the correct manner. The question of protection of employees goes to the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>

It is a very serious situation that Senator Tierney has brought to the attention of Senator Schacht. However, Senator Schacht did not answer the question. The kind of huffing and puffing that Senator Murphy is on about, the attitude adopted by Senator Schacht, and indeed the remarks of the portfolio minister, Mr Crean, on ABC television last night, were all attempts to give the impression that all is well.

The whole area of government programs to help unemployed young people, unemployed middle-aged Australians and unemployed older Australians has been found to be wanting in credibility.

<PARA>John Marriott was born in 1913 at Elliott, Tasmania, and was educated at Launceston Grammar School and Hutchins School in Hobart. From 1940 to 1945 he was a member of the Australian Imperial Force. He served with the Australian Corps of Signals in the Middle East and New Guinea, attaining the rank of captain. After the war John Marriott became a member of the staff of the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party, then in 1949 he took up the post of secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1953 John Marriott was chosen by his state to fill a vacancy in the Senate. When he came to this place, he not only filled the vacancy but also carried on a strong family tradition of political service, both his father and his brother having held Tasmanian seats at various times since 1922. In mid-1953 he was elected in his own right and was successful at four subsequent elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1971 John Marriott was appointed Assistant Minister to the then Minister for Health, Sir Kenneth Anderson. This followed his two-year membership of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. He strongly supported the control of drug and alcohol advertising and the promotion of drug awareness. Other committee service included his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Publications and the Joint Committee on the ACT. He was also Deputy Chairman of the Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures and in 1973 he was appointed Temporary Chairman of Committees. They are merely a few highlights of John Marriott's very valuable contribution to the work of various committees in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was chosen to represent Tasmania in the Senate in March 1953 in place of former Senator Chamberlain. He was, as I said, a senator for 23 years, being elected to the Senate in July 1953 and again in 1958, 1964, 1970 and 1974. As has been said, he came from a well known political family. His father, Captain Frank Marriott, and brother, Mr Fred Marriott, both held seats in the Tasmanian parliament between 1922 and 1961. In fact between Captain Marriott and his two sons, the Marriott family can claim 53 years continuous parliamentary service, with at least one of them present in the Tasmanian or federal parliament every year from 1922 to 1975. He served on many Senate and joint committees and was Temporary Chairman of Committees and member of the executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will be remembered particularly I think for his work in this place in relation to drug abuse. He was Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse and, as has also been said, long before it became a prominent issue was concerned about public reaction to advertising techniques used to promote smoking, alcohol and drugs in general. No doubt he would have been encouraged by moves in recent years to limit the advertising of these products, particularly at sporting events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a compassionate man, opposing society's condemnation of drug users. In a speech to the Alcoholism Foundation of Victoria in 1971, he stated:</PARA>

Too often people literally throw up their hands in horror and do all they can to shun and ostracise the drug taker, when that is the time the person needs friendship and support.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something, Mr President, that we should all remember. In 1972 he was honoured to be chosen as consultant to the United States National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. He also attended the 30th International Conference on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence in Amsterdam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also well known in Canberra for his role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, chairing many inquiries including the 1970 inquiry into Sunday observance in the ACT.

For many years he played an active and unselfish role in community and charity organisations, foremost amongst them Legacy, of which he was a founding member. Many weekends, as I said, were spent chopping wood for war widows and mowing church lawns.

The committee's report advocated tougher laws to control the advertising of drugs, including cigarettes. In his capacity as committee chairman, he was concerned that society should help and not shun those addicted to drug use. He was particularly outspoken about drug trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a matter which has not yet been emphasised. In 1975 the Liberal Party exposed to the world the disasters which occur when an opposition party wins a majority in the Senate. Senator Marriott cautioned his party against forcing a double dissolution by blocking supply. Unfortunately, history records that his warning went unheeded. History also records that, when the election was held in November 1975, Senator Marriott was missing from the Liberal Party's line-up.

One of the previous speakers&mdash;I think it was Senator Hill&mdash;adverted to a speech that John Marriott gave about drug abuse and the need for a caring and Christian approach to those who have fallen into that practice. Whilst condemning the evil, he was always ready to show support and affection for and give guidance to those who were in the grip of that evil. The fact that there were so many people packed into that cathedral to bid farewell to an 81-year-old man, an ex-politician, really says something for that person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Marriott's service to the community did not end when he left parliament. On the contrary, it seemed to enlarge and expand into a whole range of areas in which he was interested. Mention has been made of Legacy. This was very dear to John Marriott's heart.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I have been aware for quite some time of the activities of Senator John Marriott, but it is only in recent times that I have taken the trouble to fully acquaint myself not only with his parliamentary service but also with his personal ideals. It is very evident from what I have been able to absorb that John Marriott was a man of extremely strong character and will who battled a number of very personal and tragic issues during his life and came out on top. If there is any evidence needed of the strength of the former Senator Marriott's character then I believe his very open public admissions about his difficulties stand as an example to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that at the end of the day people judge former Senator Marriott not on his past but on the contribution which he so ably made to the workings of this parliament. He entered the Senate in 1953 and, during his parliamentary service, the Marriott family was able to celebrate 50 years of continuous parliamentary service. As has been said, his father, Captain Frank Marriott, and his brother, Mr Fred Marriott, both served with distinction in the Tasmanian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke earlier of the vision which former Senator Marriott displayed and I want to refer in particular to his work as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse during the 1970s because it was during this period of his parliamentary service that Senator Marriott displayed a deep understanding of the problems which the spread of drugs would cause within the community. In particular, Senator Marriott was concerned about the effect which drugs would have on our young, as he recognised that they were particularly vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite his concern over drug abuse and his relentless attacks on those who peddled drugs, Senator Marriott displayed considerable sympathy for those caught in the web of drug abuse. He attacked many Australian adults for their cruel, heartless outlook on drug users.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too often people literally throw up their hands in horror and do all they can to shun and ostracise the drug taker when that is the time the person needs friendship and support.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Marriott also advocated counselling and support services for drug users. Today we hear much debate on the issue of controls regarding the advertising of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes in Australia, yet this was a matter which had already come under the scrutiny of Senator Marriott in 1970. At that time, he was a strong advocate of advertising controls and also opposed the oversupply of therapeutic drugs, the abuse of drugs available without prescription and the mis-advertising of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Marriott's strong commitment to the anti-drug case was recognised at the international level when he was invited by the United States National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse to be its honorary consul in Australia. His career ended with some controversy, as Senator Bell said, in 1975. It may be fair to say that former Senator John Marriott was a victim of his own honest, forthright attitude, as it appears he may have paid a price for speaking his mind on the role of the Senate, an issue about which he obviously felt very strongly. I join all my Tasmanian colleagues in offering sympathy to his wife Myra and the rest of his family. </PARA>

He believed that his committee had a good grasp of the facts with regard to extending local self-government to Canberra residents, and he had a strong personal interest as he had considered the city his home away from home for 20 years. John Marriott also had a strong sense of propriety and the correct way to undertake his dealings as chairman of committees. He worked to avoid informal contacts with people who might at some time appear before his committees as witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loyalty to his committees, his party, his Queen and country demonstrates the make-up of John Marriott. A newspaper article in 1970 quoted his wife Myra as saying that she had not spent a new year's eve with her husband for the previous eight years as he had always been away playing father to 160 children at Legacy camp. John also displayed a deep loyalty to the philosophy of his party and to his colleagues in the Liberal Party. After his retirement from parliamentary service in 1975, he was awarded a CBE for service to politics in the Queen's Birthday honours of 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as loyalty, many who knew John Marriott well remember his wit and humour&mdash;which was referred to by my colleague Senator Harradine&mdash;and also his dedication to people and causes he chose to be associated with. Apart from his long association with Legacy, John in latter years provided leadership to the Order of the British Empire Tasmanian Association. He was a foundation member, but also gave dedicated work as honorary secretary and treasurer for many years as well as filling the role of president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary among all the labels which could be applied to John Marriott was that of being a proud Tasmanian. Throughout his parliamentary career, his main goal was the promotion of the interests of his constituents, the people in his own state. The late John Marriott's far sightedness was highlighted in one of his last speeches in this chamber. At the height of the debate in August 1975 over the controversial Whitlam government budget, he referred to the Labor government's attempt to hoodwink Tasmanian voters. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might be islanders, but we are perceptive. We have been fooled around too much by this government in its short term in office.</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to Mr Whitlam's petulance in relation to Tasmania when Whitlam said, `Let us look for votes elsewhere', Marriott said, `The electorate will swing the numbers and lead to the formation of a Liberal government.' His comments were indeed prophetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His last substantial speech in this chamber criticised the Labor government for what he saw as undue delay, for political purposes, in passing the bill to permit the rapid commencement of work on the broken Tasman bridge. The distress caused by the bridge's damage was at that time causing considerable anguish to the residents of Hobart's eastern shore, breaking up families, fostering suicides and making people's lives a misery. John Marriott empathised with these people and genuinely objected to devious delays to repairs to the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I support the motion and add my personal condolences to his wife Myra, his daughter and his brother Fred whom I have known for many years at this time of their loss. Tasmania has lost a loyal and true statesman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon very briefly to support the motion of condolence relating to the distinguished service of former Senator John Marriott. I do so as a senator but also in another role and that is as the immediate past President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Tasmanian division. In doing so, I want to support all the comments made by colleagues on all sides of this chamber in relation to his dedicated work for the people of Tasmania, and the parliament and its processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His history has been spoken of by previous speakers and I do not intend to repeat that distinguished record.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Marriott was part of an era which included notables such as former Senator the Hon. Reg Wright. As the Liberal Party enters its 50th year, it must recognise that inevitably with the passage of time such important foundation members of the Liberal Party as Reg Wright and John Marriott have to pass on. It is the passing of an era in Tasmanian politics and in the history of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. Mention has already been made, but it is worth mentioning again, that John and his family made a contribution to parliamentary service in excess of half a century. Theirs was a family of service to the people of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall, as a relatively youthful state president of the Liberal Party in my state, coming under some criticism for being part of an administrative committee which was allegedly setting a dangerous precedent. I, of course, was not aware of history within the Liberal Party. Former Senator John Marriott let me know that some of the people who were expressing that concern had set the precedent themselves some 20-odd years earlier, something of which I was not aware. John Marriott was concerned that honesty at all times be a vital element in politics. He was concerned to see that the record be set straight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my personal point of view, I was greatly indebted to him for making available to me his wisdom, his knowledge and his wealth of experience that he so freely gave when called upon. Unfortunately, it appears that the Liberal Party did not call on John Marriott as often as it should have done. John Marriott retained his interest within the Liberal Party. He gave very freely of himself, his experience and his vast knowledge. I extend my personal sympathy, and also the sympathy of all Liberals in Tasmania, to Myra, his widow; to his daughter, Patricia, and her family; and to his brother, Fred. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met John Marriott when I went to live in Hobart in 1973. I think he was one of nature's gentlemen. He was deserving of the honours which have been given him today because he gave a lifetime of service. He served his country as a soldier on active service in war, and I can think of no greater service anyone can do for one's nation. He served the Liberal Party organisation in the early years of its foundation&mdash;and we are this year celebrating its 50th anniversary. That was a noble purpose which endures today. He served the people of Tasmania as a senator, and other senators have elaborated on the many areas of interest which he pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also served the widows and children of servicemen who died serving our country. It is not widely known that Legacy was actually founded in Tasmania. John Marriott joined Legacy in 1946 and remained a very active member, as others have mentioned already. He would go home from Canberra after a busy week, roll up his sleeves&mdash;I think the bishop was talking about this at his memorial service&mdash;and go out to chop the wood and give other practical help to families of soldiers, sailors and airmen. Finally, he served his God, and he served his church, throughout a long and dedicated life. His was a life of which his family and his nation can be proud. I honour his memory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hinton's illness was one very good reason why it was necessary to delay the reporting date, because that then affected the attendance of a number of other Public Service witnesses. Of course, there has been the intransigence of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the contemptuous refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to cooperate. We ultimately received a very belated acknowledgment that a crucial document is in fact valid. I was very grateful for the Treasurer making that last minute concession. So, in those circumstances, in order to ensure that the committee takes fully into account all of the evidence that is necessary, and particularly in order to enable us further time to obtain the answers to the very important questions listed on the two pages I have had incorporated today, I am hopeful that the motion will pass without comment tomorrow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow the government is to release its 23rd economic, employment and industry statement in its 11 years in office. Each of its 22 predecessors have sunk without trace or have had disastrous consequences for jobs, for growth and for the livelihoods and social wellbeing of the overwhelming majority of Australians and especially for middle Australia. The rich have not had it too bad&mdash;many them have got richer&mdash;but the heartbeat of Australia, the lifeblood of Australia, the average Australian, has copped it very hard indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social problems facing Australia today are without parallel in the memory of any of us here today. The increase in crime, violence, homelessness, suicides and despair affect every Australian, either directly or indirectly. Nowhere is this felt more than in the minds and homes of the almost one million Australians who cannot find any work at all or the additional million who have given up looking for work because they know it is just not available or who are employed for just a few hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts are the end result, the harsh bottom line, of this government's 22 previous economic and related statements. They are the human face of the tragedy that masquerades under the cruel charade of the government's policies&mdash;policies that this government monstrously misrepresents as constituting fairness, equity and social justice. Where is the social justice in a million unemployed or in the thousands of homeless youths, we may well ask of this insensitive, hypocritical government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why we have this human tragedy, this government onslaught on our social fabric, are not hard to find. They are there for all of us to see. No dressing up of the cyclical upturn in the economy, no fiddling with the unemployment figures as the government is doing can disguise the real truth that there are quite fundamental problems confronting the Australian economy which are holding back, retarding and inhibiting the huge potential that Australia has to create jobs and to embark on exciting economic growth. The symptoms of these problems are also crystal clear for all to see unless, of course, one is a member of this government, in which case one turns a blind eye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the Senate of just a few of those symptoms. First, we have a level of gross foreign debt exceeding $200,000 million. That is a seven-fold or more increase since Labor came to power in 1983. That level of foreign debt is far and away the highest in the whole world on a per capita basis and is still growing under this government by up to $20 billion every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have an enormous balance of payments deficit on our current account&mdash;the largest of any OECD country or any nation in our region&mdash;which of course leads to this huge foreign debt problem. The government will point to growth in exports and say, `Aren't we doing well?' That growth in exports is indeed welcome, but it is not good enough. Our competitor nations are doing much better than us. Our share of the fast growing Asian market is falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is a continuing huge deficit in the government's own operations&mdash;$13 billion to $15 billion this year alone. When all three levels of government are included, the total deficit this financial year, 1993-94, is estimated to be a massive $27.5 billion, of which the federal government is responsible for three-quarters. At 6.2 per cent of our total national product, this will be our second largest deficit since the Second World War, exceeded only by the deficit in the first year of this government's reign, 1983-84. This year's deficit is even larger than that in 1975-76, when we had our largest deficit in what was rightly described as the disastrous, big-spending Whitlam era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, and importantly, as a consequence of these huge public deficits and the fully understandable concern in the markets that this tired, arrogant government has neither the will nor the ability to bring them under control, long-term interest rates in the last four months alone have risen by one-third to 8.5 per cent. That is higher than any of the world's major economies and higher, even, than our Tasman partner New Zealand. Those levels of budget deficits and interest rates come at a time when we have a desperate need for increased savings and investment. But what do we have instead? We have a fundamental lack of private business investment, an actual contraction of our capital stock and record low domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That disastrous litany does not have to be. It is not preordained. It is within our capabilities to change, to harness the enormous potential of skills, resources and other advantages that we possess. No greater criticism can be made of any government than that it pursues policies deliberately and knowingly which prevent its people from sharing in the jobs, the joy, the participation and the economic and social wellbeing that should be theirs. The coalition levels that criticism at this inept government, and we level it in spades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment has now been over 10 per cent for more than three years. The Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, rightly said in a recent speech that our current level of unemployment was `a matter of choice'. Mr Evans was correct. This government has made a deliberate choice to have 10 per cent and more unemployment. It is impossible to comprehend or condone that any political party, let alone government, would be prepared to choose to adopt policies that result in one in 10 Australians being unable to find work, many of them for ever and a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three fundamental issues that the Keating Labor government will have to address in its statement tomorrow and in next week's budget. The first one is industrial relations, the second is its appalling budgetary situation, and the third is the reform of our infrastructure industries such as transport, power and communications. The government has already released what purports to be much of its main proposals in tomorrow's statement. The hypocrisy of some of those is quite breathtaking: in particular, a training wage of $3.20 per hour. It is only a year or so ago that the government mercilessly berated the coalition for advocating a youth training wage that was in fact higher than that now being introduced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the government tackles head on the three issues to which I have referred, all the training wages, all the fiddles with allowances and all the hype will be just that: like the 1990 budget, which was, according to Mr Keating, going to bring home the bacon but which instead brought home only the recession we had to have; like the March 1991 industry statement, which failed even to acknowledge the recession, let alone the record growth in bankruptcies occurring around the nation at that very time; like Prime Minister Hawke's November 1991 so-called employment statement, which failed to produce one job and did not save his, which was really the intended purpose of it; and like Mr Keating's 1992 One Nation statement, which promised the creation of 800,000 jobs but was instead accompanied by a doubling in the number of long-term unemployed and which, two years later, has seen the number of extra jobs barely exceed the expansion in the labour force that has taken place in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is the achilles heel of the Australian economy and of the Labor Party. The Labor Party's incestuous relationship with the trade union movement means that it cannot ever bring itself to act in the national interest in this area and free up the anachronistic wage fixing system. Indeed, if the Labor Party was serious about tackling unemployment, about tackling the lack of investment and about tackling our chronic balance of payments deficit, repealing last year's industrial relations legislation would be a major and essential first step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has presided over the worst ever deterioration in Australia's fiscal bottom line. Indeed, the government's own Fitzgerald report into national savings squarely laid the blame for Australia's disastrously low domestic savings for investment at the feet of the federal government with its high deficit budget policy. It is absolutely essential that next week's budget statement tackle that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the snail's pace at which the government has pursued micro-economic reform to date, and the opposition of Labor's Left to ongoing privatisation, does not bode well for future progress in this essential area. These are the policy requirements against which tomorrow's 23rd economic statement and next week's budget will be judged. The long, bitter and costly experience of the past 11 bleak, lost years does not give me or the coalition any feeling of confidence that the broken promises and the extravagant impossible undertakings of the past will be repealed. Very few leopards change their spots, and on this occasion I am afraid that this government is no exception. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

If we had the same participation rate that was available in 1981-82, when the coalition was last in government the unemployment rate, I am told, would be more like five or six per cent rather than the present far too high 10.5 per cent, because there are so many more people entering the work force&mdash;particularly women. We do not in any way discourage them; we believe that women have the right to that choice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the economic record of this government. In the last 10 years we have been going through a period of unparalleled restructuring. We now have the lowest inflation rate for 30 years&mdash;a fact that did not get one mention from Senator Short in his remarks. We have now come out of the recession and we have strong job growth. Since last March, 173,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no mention from the opposition or by Senator Short about the number of job increases brought about by this government. No mention was made by Senator Short about the fact that this government has a locked in budget deficit reduction program by 1996-97&mdash;namely, to get the budget deficit down to one per cent of GDP. We have had no alternative policies from the other side. We have heard nothing about how the opposition would go about reducing the deficit. Instead, we have had some vague mention that the deficit should be below $10 billion for this year. There has been no mention from those opposite as to where the opposition would cut expenditure, just a throwaway line. Then opposition members say, `But we will not spend any money on unemployment.' That was raised today during question time by Senator Tierney, who criticised the DEET programs. We accept that where mistakes are made they will be dealt with, but the opposition does not want to spend one dollar on the long term unemployed. Indeed, the opposition has no policies with which to deal with the situation and has ignored the success of the Labor government in restructuring the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short made no mention of the fact that in this year of 1994 we will have a GDP of around four per cent, and probably even higher by the end of this year. We will see sustained economic growth, one of the highest, if not the highest, in the OECD. We see business confidence returning. Certainly all the surveys by independent banks and independent organisations, including surveys by the chamber of commerce, reflect the fact that confidence is returning to the business community that will lead to an upturn in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen strong housing growth and strong retail sales. All of these are leading to an economy that will be able to be sustained over a longer period than in the past. We will not go through the boom and bust cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major successes of the present government has been in turning our economy into an internationally competitive and export oriented one. This has brought about remarkable change from the economy that obtained in Australia in the preceding 80-odd years. I think that is a remarkable achievement. Despite the cries of the opposition, it has been achieved because of the cooperation of the trade union movement, with the various accords signed by this government with the trade union movement. That has brought about the lowest level of industrial disputation in history. In the past 10 years unions and their members have been willing to forgo demands for wage increases to get the economy back on track. They have been willing to put up with major structural adjustment under which many jobs have gone from many industries. This has been done to enable those industries to be competitive so that we can create jobs elsewhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this matter, which is a most serious one for all Australians. No government can create sustainable jobs. Those jobs can only come from strong economic growth&mdash;underpinned, in turn, by a high level of private sector investment. On the other hand, governments can destroy jobs.

That solution was tried by the Whitlam Labor government in the early 1970s and was found to be an economic and political disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this type of policy over the past decade or more that has created the boom and bust situation which has become the trademark of this government. Nowhere in any sneak preview of the white paper is there any mention of growth or investment, I believe, as possible solutions to the unemployment problem in this country. Nowhere does it seem that the government has taken notice of the comment by the Governor of the Reserve Bank that there is a greater need for a growth compact than a jobs compact. Only sustainable growth in the economy can result in new, lasting employment. That is not to say that the problem of long-term unemployment cannot be assisted by properly targeted labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major factors which are important to a return to full employment were concisely summarised by the OECD Forum for the Future, held in Paris early this year. The key points were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much improved rates of economic growth are deemed essential; labour costs&mdash;especially non-wage labour costs&mdash;need bringing down.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true of the training guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rigidities of the labour and labour markets need loosening up.</PARA>
<PARA>What has the government done about that aspect?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater efforts are called for in education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>Many economists and financial commentators, such as Helen Hughes and Richard Blandy, have suggested that the commonsense solution to unemployment lies in generating much stronger economic growth&mdash;in the vicinity of six to seven per cent. We should remember that back in the 1960s that is the rate at which Australia grew. Our Asian neighbours are all growing at that rate or even higher right now. The last time that we were coming out of a major recession, in the early 1980s, we were growing at six per cent, 2 1/2 years from the bottom of the recession. Now we are growing at only four per cent, which is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further economic growth is certainly at risk. What do we need to do to fix it up? First we have to free up the labour market. But what has the government done on that score?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government can reduce pressure on financial markets by reducing the budget deficit to less than $10 billion. Going beyond that, it can aim for a surplus within two years. In the mid 1980s the Labor government ran a surplus. That period was one of high investment and high job growth. Surely those opposite can learn from their own experience. But now Australia has a much higher debt level than it had in the middle of the 1980s. As Senator Short said, we have the highest debt level per capita in the world, so we are in an even more fragile state now as compared with a decade or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why had the money markets lifted the bond rates over two per cent in the last couple of months? The lift in the USA over the same period was only 1.3 per cent. Why that extra margin when our inflation is lower than theirs? It is because the world financial markets regard Australia as being a greater risk. If we want jobs growth the government has one option: reduce the deficit and aim for a surplus as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of growth that the government has not chased is micro-economic reform. It started off on ports, electricity, gas, transport and telecommunications, but it has lost the game; it has not carried through. Unions frightened the government off. The fourth area is to reduce government expenditure and thereby reduce taxes and encourage investment, encourage business activity. The government has reduced the income of the states. The Commonwealth should have done what the states have done, but the Commonwealth in the last three years has increased its expenditure by 15 per cent. The 800,000 businesses around Australia have had to reduce expenditure. We saw last night an example of waste on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program about DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Labor in its 11 years in office had, first of all, freed up the labour market, secondly, pursued micro-economic reform in transport et cetera, thirdly, reduced government expenditure, and, fourthly, used the taxes to encourage business investment instead of to discourage it, then the white paper would not be necessary. The proposed spending spree is a recognition that after 11 years in office Labor's policies have failed. </PARA>

Their contribution to the very important and serious debate that has occurred in Australia over the last six to nine months is, on the day before the white paper is released, to say, `We ought to address the fundamental problems.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now what the opposition does not do in this motion today, and what it did not do in addressing the issues in the debate, is give any recognition to the successes in the economy or the strength of the economy. Senator Short in particular wants to list what he perceives as the negatives, but there is no recognition in the motion or in the debate about the strengths that exist in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have a balanced debate and examine this issue seriously, we have to recognise that there are strengths in the economy; that the economy is improving. This leads me to the point made by Senator Gibson&mdash;which was a good one and with which I agree: the major solution, the prime answer to the unemployment question, is strong economic growth. There is no disagreement with the opposition on that. That has been the basis of everything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) have been saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what the opposition has failed to recognise is that in the December quarter of last year we had 1.7 per cent growth in the economy or a 4 per cent annual growth rate. So we are starting to see strong growth in the economy. Those opposite can always say, from the comfort of the opposition benches where they do not have to be responsible for anything, that we can do better. We can always do better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime answer to unemployment is strong economic growth. The government is setting about trying to achieve that and we are starting to see in the economy strengths in things like economic growth. We have seen a slight fall in the unemployment rate and we have got the lowest inflation in 30 years. So some of the economic fundamentals are being provided to stimulate strong growth. But what we recognise and what those opposite did not recognise is that that growth alone will not solve the unemployment problem. Even strong economic growth of record levels will not solve the unemployment problem in Australia. That is what has been recognised by all the economic commentators. That is what has been conceded and recognised by this government. We have to do more. In particular we have to do more to address the problems of those people who are the long-term unemployed because they will not necessarily get picked up by the growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is about addressing those problems. It is trying to say, yes, we will have growth and we are encouraging growth in the economy and we will provide the incentives for a level of growth and that will go a long way to addressing the unemployment problem. But we will need to do more if we are to solve the problems of a whole group of Australians&mdash;those long-term unemployed who will not benefit necessarily from that growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is about helping those people. It is about doing the extra, making the extra effort, providing the extra measures that will solve or go a long way towards solving those problems and helping and assisting those people back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what it is about. I do not know where those opposite have been but that is what it is about and that is what the rest of the Australian community is focussing on. That is what tomorrow's white paper will be about, and the white paper will start to provide help for those long-term unemployed and concentrate on those issues. So on the one hand we will have the economic growth that is the engine room of the employment growth that we are going to need, but we will also have the special measures in the white paper targeting the long-term unemployed and providing assistance to make sure that we deal with their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we have to recognise that the fundamental strengths in the economy are turning. All the business reports and all the surveys of business confidence are starting to reflect this. Now there are remaining problems, as Senator Gibson said, and business investment is one of them and we do have to see greater business investment, but to highlight the problems is not to take a politically responsible position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators cannot just say we have no policies but there are problems. They get elected to help be part of the solution and turning up the day before the white paper and saying, `Oh, there are problems in this economy' is not good enough.

I rather regret that the government and opposition during the last decade or so have really been following the same policy&mdash;basically, leave it to the markets, sink or swim, and if you sink, well, that is just too bad; you join the 200,000 who have lost jobs specifically and directly as a result of our tariff cuts program. It is time that we decided that we need a deliberate, strategic industry and trade policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the tariff cuts, but when we look at the quota restrictions that other countries are using we find that we are the only country with any sort of TCF industry, with a substantive car industry, that does not now employ any quantitative restraints on imports. When a Chinese textile factory pays $20 to a worker for a 48-hour week it does not make much sense even to impose tariffs. The disparity between the costs Australian manufacturers face and the costs that other countries get away with is such that, unless we have a government which is prepared to intervene and to ensure that jobs are available for workers in these factories, we are going to slide further down the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what sort of interventionist measures we are likely to get. I note that it is about 10 years since an Australian government used the exemptions provided under GATT to provide some protection to workers&mdash;some boost to our balance of payments. Instead, quite apart from not being prepared to do that, we have engaged on a spree of selling strategic assets, strategic mechanisms, starting with the Commonwealth Bank and now with the Australian Industry Development Corporation which is going to be sold to private enterprise when the government could use it to ensure that Australian industries are supplied with sufficient funds&mdash;venture capital and general finance&mdash;to develop Australian inventions. </PARA>

It is quite clear that the current economic recovery will do nothing for the bulk of Australia's unemployed. Economic history shows that, when economic activity picks up, the money spent on imports will rise, and we are not doing anything at this stage to control the flood of cheap imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must recognise that a substantial part of our unemployment is structural unemployment and structural problems require structural solutions. I am pleased to refer the Senate to a range of industry measures which we suggest the government should take and which should certainly be included in its white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to survive in the international marketplace unless we can produce products and services which are innovative and excellent in quality and which provide to customers what customers want. At the moment there is very little evidence that the government is prepared to take strategic measures to advance innovation in Australian industries. If we want to get a higher level of innovation, if we want to improve our performance, we need to boost research and development, and education and training. We need to provide finance and focus investment on those areas where further investment will generate specific jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to coordinate our efforts. We need to make sure that specific industries follow strategic plans and we need to ensure that in a geographic sense we do not leave behind our regional areas. On a recent trip to country Victoria where I visited six regional centres it was quite clear that there is tremendous potential in our regional industries. That was documented very carefully and forcefully in the Kelty report but we have yet to hear from the government on whether it is prepared to implement the Kelty report recommendations on regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about our strategic measures in those three areas I suggest to the government that in the area of research it should certainly reverse its proposal to cut the funds to CSIRO by $50 million.

We must also recognise, as stated in the Kelty report and acknowledged in other reports and assessments, that small business and the enterprises that are active in regional areas offer the best hope for an increase in employment. We therefore suggest that the research and development tax deduction threshold be reduced from $50,000 to $30,000&mdash;an expenditure of some $60 million. I am sure that that amount of money could be found for such a strategic approach.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. At least Senator Gibson made a couple of points which, if implemented, would help rectify some of the problems confronting this and other countries that are coming out of the recession. Australia is not the only country that has had a recession. Strong economic growth is important; but we have to go back further than this little foray today to look at the way this country has developed over time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an historical point of view, for many years this country had an inward looking economy. This country based its wealth purely on the very minor development of its resources; it got rid of them in the rawest possible form and rode on the sheep's back for many years. When this government came into office one of the things it was confronted with was changing the fundamental focus of industry in this country. Unfortunately we have not yet been able to change it all. There have been some significant successes. Many of our industries are now export-orientated and are very successful and will become more successful. That will lead to employment and strong economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use as an example one industry in which Senator Gibson used to participate, namely, the forest industry. Yesterday I listened to the Premier of Tasmania make a major announcement about some benefit from the forest industry, by saying that we need to export another 1.1 million tonnes of woodchips per annum to really give a boost to the Tasmanian forest industry. Something is drastically wrong if that is the conservatives' logic on how we should get on with industry development in this country. That certainly should not be the case, given that we know there are so many other value-added processes into which the forest industry could enter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler raised some interesting points about the training of workers. He has now left the chamber; nevertheless, with regard to the history of education and training this government's record stands alone. I think Senator Gibson claimed that the training guarantee levy was an impediment. One of the fundamental reasons the government introduced a training guarantee levy was that employers out there in all industries were not making any effort to actually train their workers and provide them with an opportunity to improve their skills because we had this tailoristic approach to the old ways in which industry operated for many years. We needed to do something, and we did it. If it has done nothing else, the levy has focused some industry participants on the need to train people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short raised a matter of public importance without even knowing what is in the government's white paper. That bemused government members and provided us with a source of information. However, I want to quickly turn to the one relevant statement by Senator Short, that a leopard never changes its spots. I found that interesting, given Dr Hewson's new approach to things. I quote from an article by Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hewson's idea of damage control is trotting out the old tried (and untrue) lines</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Hewson, after four years as leader of the federal Liberal Party, finally discovered what most Politics 1 students could have told him at the start of their course. "Politics," he announced, "is about building constituencies in support of you, not building constituencies against you." Liberals must have felt like echoing that well-known academic, Professor Henry Higgins: "He's got it! By George, he's got it!"</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think the opposition has got it because it certainly did not come in here with it today, and it does not look like it will have it in the future because the opposition has really missed the point&mdash;it has provided no policies and it has no idea about where we should be heading.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian people can take some comfort from the fact that there appears to be bipartisan agreement that mass unemployment, not experienced for 60 years, is this nation's No. 1 problem, and there is bipartisan commitment to achieving genuine, full employment. It is also comforting that there is bipartisan agreement that the Australian Democrats' protectionist position is completely and utterly irrelevant to this debate and we cannot go back down that track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, today on the topic of the government's white paper, which appropriately the government will hand down tomorrow, all we heard was government rhetoric and abuse of the opposition. Before the last election the government attacked the opposition for having policies and now it wants to attack us for having no policies. The Australian people have to remember the causes for one million being unemployed. This government lost control of the economy in the late 1980s and applied the brakes of high interest rates, which destroyed businesses right across the country and put one million people out of work. We are suffering high unemployment as a result of the government's policies, and the Australian people should never forget it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two key aspects to unemployment: the supply of labour and the demand for labour, both of which have to be addressed. On the supply of labour, government policy has a very direct contribution to make. Stupidly, this government has been deliberately contributing to an over-supply of labour. In the 1980s this government ran one of the highest immigration programs that this country had ever seen&mdash;one of the highest immigration programs in the world. On the government's own figures, nearly one-third of recently arrived immigrants are unemployed. The government's own supporters and the people of this nation are saying, `When you have one million unemployed, why are you running such high immigration rates?' As a result of the recession the rate of immigration has fallen. It is a fact that this country can sustain only a certain level of immigration if it does not want to see unemployment blow out again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard nothing from the government on this critical issue of population policy and immigration. Those opposite have nothing to say on the subject. Is it a case that immigration is going to blow out again and immigrants will come here and join the dole queues? Australians will rightly say, `What nonsense is this? With a million unemployed you simply bring in more and more immigrants.' Those opposite should tell us what their population policy is. They should tell the Australian people what their immigration policy is. We want to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the supply of labour which this government also fails to address is the massive increase in the number of women in the paid work force. Senator Schacht took the opportunity to abuse me for my position on this issue. I point out to Senator Schacht that my wife, who has two young children, is a part-time worker, and she works with my encouragement. She works at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, which I noticed Senator Schacht was just reading. However, our issue here is equal opportunity: equal opportunity to be in the work force and equal opportunity for women not to be in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Survey after survey reveals that it is this government's economic policies which have forced so many women into the paid work force. Those opposite ignore it at their own peril. People such as former Senator Walsh keep reminding those opposite that they are using taxpayers' funds to try to get as many more women as possible into the paid work force. When there are a million people unemployed, it is a nonsense to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to deny women the opportunity to do what they want to do which is to care for their children at home. The government's policies force them into the work force, thereby creating more unemployment. Those opposite should pay more attention to one of the most learned men the Labor Party has produced, that is, former Senator Peter Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for labour is a function of growth and a function of the capacity to sustain growth. Those are two things that those opposite seem to forget. It is also a function of the cost of employing labour&mdash;again something that those opposite choose to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every economic commentator in the country makes it clear that if we are going to have sustainable economic growth&mdash;which is what we all want to achieve&mdash;we have to have a much lower government deficit than those opposite are contemplating. I trust that in the budget those opposite will pull the old rabbit out of the hat and actually have a lower deficit than the kite they have been flying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth also requires a much faster pace of micro-economic reform than this government has been pursuing. If we were in government we would be pursuing much faster micro-economic reform and we would be bringing in a much lower deficit than the government is currently contemplating. The government must address the question of the cost of employing labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this government gives us all the rhetoric about employment, its own policies are making it impossible for employers. By definition, employers are people who actually employ people. The government brings in policies that are nothing more than a disincentive to employ people. Those opposite pay attention to what John Prescott says. Mr Prescott is the chief executive of BHP, one of the biggest employers in this country. He recently said to the government, `Your own policies are a disincentive to us as employers to employ people.' Those opposite should face up to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest Industrial Relations Act is a backdown by those opposite. After the election they backed down from their own original position because they are intimidated by the unions. The Industrial Relations Act contains provisions which are a disincentive to employers to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal procedures are a nonsense, a joke. We have had small employers all over the country say to us, `We are terrified of putting on more people because of what this government has done in relation to unfair dismissal provisions.' The whole tax system is a massive disincentive to employ people. What those opposite have done on FBT is a joke and I can understand why people will be discouraged from employing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the training guarantee levy, the government's own people are saying that we have got to get rid of that because it is a disincentive to employment. What those opposite have done in the compulsory superannuation guarantee area is a disincentive to employment. Those opposite seem intent on spending more and more money simply to mop up the damage caused by their own policies while they bring in other policies that are a disincentive to employers in this country to employ people. I hope that the government will address these very fundamental issues in the white paper and in the budget because they have been ignored to this point. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December last year, the Committee released a discussion paper Restoring Full Unemployment, and has conducted community consultations about the ideas and options raised in this paper. The Government will respond to the Discussion Paper in a White Paper dealing with employment and industry issues to be released on 4 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The White Paper will address many of the issues raised in Wanted: Our Future by the Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The Committee recommends that the issue of the labour market prospects of graduates and the general implications for Australia of increasing the level of tertiary qualifications in the community be referred to either the House of Representatives Committee on Long Term Strategies or the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. (Page 24)(1)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, the Commonwealth Government has funded significant growth in higher education places. The economic objective of this policy is to enhance the skill base of the population to meet changing labour market needs and to support industry restructuring and microeconomic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as importantly, the social objective is to open up access to higher education to a wider cross-section of the community. The expansion of the number of student places, improved income support for students, targeted equity programs and the provision of more flexible delivery of courses and entry arrangements have all encouraged greater participation by those groups traditionally under-represented in higher education. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government announced more highly targeted public funding of higher education to ensure a balance between those undertaking further study and those seeking to enter for the first time. To improve access and equity in higher education, better targeting arrangements for HECS and student assistance under AUSTUDY and the introduction of HECS style repayment arrangements for eligible students under Open Learning will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Levels of educational attainment among the unemployed have risen as part of a long term trend which is also evident in the labour force. More recently, the current labour market downturn has seen unemployment rates increase for those with post school qualifications along with the rest of the labour force. Nevertheless, the possession of post school qualifications, especially a degree, still greatly reduces one's chances of being unemployed. According to the ABS survey Labour Force Status and Educational Attainment conducted in February 1993, the unemployment rate among graduates was 6.2% compared with 12.1% for the total labour force. Those holding any form of post-school qualification, including a trades certificate, had an unemployment rate of 9.1%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While possession of post school qualifications does not guarantee immunity from unemployment, those of the unemployed who are better qualified should be well placed to benefit from future job growth as the recovery gathers pace. The Government considers that a specific inquiry into unemployment among graduates is not warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee on Employment Opportunities has examined the relationship between growth in higher education places and the needs of the labour market. In its discussion paper, Restoring Full Employment, the Committee argues that those with post school qualifications are likely to be more successful in the labour market than those without. However, the Committee cautions that without job growth, expanding the number of higher education places may stimulate credentialism instead of reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Committee recommends that the Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training prepare a report to the Government on the provision, under the Australian Vocational Certificate training system, of places for work-based training for young people, and on the mechanisms through which business and industry will fulfil their AVC responsibilities.(Page 33)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1992 the Australian Education Council (AEC) and Ministers of Vocational Education, Employment and Training (MOVEET) endorsed, in general terms, a strategy for the introduction of the Australian Vocational Certificate (AVC) training system. The AVC training system is to subsume the existing apprenticeship and traineeship systems and to extend structured entry-level training into areas that currently do not have such training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministers agreed that all aspects of the AVC training system would be tested through a series of pilot projects over a period of two years before commencement of the changeover to the new system from 1995. Among the issues to be addressed by the pilots is improving access to training for groups such as women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and those from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds. These groups have been under-represented in traditional training arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A National Evaluation Strategy for the AVC training system and Career Start Traineeships (CST) has been developed and agreed in principle with the States and Territories. The evaluation will have three phases:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an implementation review;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ongoing monitoring of projects and trainee outcomes; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an independent systemic review and case study analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The monitoring system to allow for the discrete identification of AVC and CST trainees and their employers is now in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first phase of the evaluation began in April 1993. Responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of the AVC pilots will rest with the Commonwealth and will be undertaken by consultants and DEET. The evaluation is being conducted in full consultation with the States and Territories through a reference group. Included in the evaluation will be an examination of the success of the pilots in dealing with the needs of the target groups identified above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the Commonwealth and State Governments are already collaborating to conduct these evaluations, the proposed review by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Committee recommends that the Australian National Training Authority be reviewed at the end of two years of operation. (Page 33)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July 1992, Heads of Government agreed to establish a National Vocational Education and Training System, including the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA). The agreed statement on the new National System is a schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992. Paragraph 40 of the statement provides that the agreement is to be reviewed before the end of 1995. ANTA became operational on 1 January 1994. ANTA will, therefore, be reviewed within two years of full operation as part of the review of the Heads of Government agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Committee recommends that the Australian National Training Authority, as a matter of urgency, (a) examines the question of education and training re-entry points for young people who have already left school and (b) develops strategies to include young people aged 20-24 in the Australian Vocational Certificate system. (Page 37)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that, in the first instance, the question of conducting the two proposed inquiries should be referred for consideration to a meeting of the recently established Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to part (b) of this recommendation, young people aged 20-24 are not excluded from the AVC pilot process. Career Start Traineeships are open to all age levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem of lack of access to training by young unemployed people has been examined by the Government's Committee on Employment Opportunities in its discussion paper Restoring Full Employment. The Committee identifies a number of possible solutions including,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">expansion of traineeship numbers to 65,000 as proposed by the ACTU,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision of a training place to all unemployed young people below a certain age, who would be required to accept a place or lose entitlement to income support, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishment of group and other co-operative schemes among employers to provide training to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the issues raised in the Senate Committee's recommendation are being addressed by the Committee on Employment Opportunities and through the development of the AVC training system, it is not appropriate for the ANTA to take responsibility for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Committee recommends that greater flexibility be introduced into existing provisions regarding the opportunities for, and support of, JSA recipients who wish to engage in volunteer work. This flexibility should enable decisions to be made at the local level on a case by case basis regarding the extent to which participation in voluntary work unduly restricts a recipient's ability to seek employment. (Page 43)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that volunteer work with community organizations can help job seekers, especially the long-term unemployed, to gain work experience, maintain or update their skills and make useful contacts with employers, thereby improving their employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relaxation of restrictions on volunteer work was announced in the 1992-93 Budget. Job Search Allowance (JSA) beneficiaries under 18 years old who have been unemployed for at least 3 months and 18-49 year olds who have been unemployed for at least 6 months may undertake full-time volunteer work to a maximum of 30 days a year (increased from 20 days a year in March 1993) while for clients aged 50-64 the maximum is 65 days. Continuing part-time volunteer work of up to 20 hours a week may be allowed, provided it does not interfere with job search activity. To ensure consistency, provisions for volunteer work are made at the local level within the framework provided by national guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government announced the establishment of the Community Activity Program (CAP) which will help 7,000 unemployed people in 1993-94 to maintain work habits and widen their experience through voluntary participation in community services, at a cost of $3 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee on Employment Opportunities has argued that consideration should be given to expanding the range of activities, including voluntary work, which can be undertaken by recipients of unemployment allowances. However, the Committee cautioned that such expansion should be compatible with community expectations that unemployment payments will be made to those who are actively seeking paid employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Committee recommends that consideration be given by Commonwealth and State education authorities to extending the TRAC model of work experience and school-work transition at both local and national levels. (Page 49)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TRAC model has operated in the Hunter region for some years and is, through the system of AVC pilots, being piloted in the Casuarina/Darwin area of the Northern Territory. TRAC is also operating in the ACT. As with all pilots undertaken, this model needs to be evaluated to determine its overall effectiveness, including cost effectiveness. This will take account of other retail models which are currently being developed through the AVC pilot process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Committee recommends that training targeted at young people be designed to incorporate personal support which is available for the duration of the training and beyond. (Page 51)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that personal support should be an important component of training programs targeting unemployed young people and this is recognised in measures to assist young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Disadvantaged Young People Services Program, for example, was established in 1990 as part of the Federal Government's Youth Social Justice Strategy. The Program recognises that young people may experience difficulties which inhibit their ability to secure and maintain employment. Assistance is provided through mentor/broker services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the program is to assist the most disadvantaged unemployed young people who are currently not attracted to, and are not competitive in, mainstream programs to secure and maintain employment by providing assistance tailored to their particular needs. Assistance provided includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">open access services including personal development and counselling;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">pre-training to provide skills required to participate in mainstream labour market programs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">referral to employment and training programs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">support in employment and training programs once placed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Government initiatives, such as the Accredited Training for Youth Program and the Landcare and Environment Action Program, also have significant elements of support services for young people. Youth services offered through SkillShare can provide continuing post-program support for young people for up to three months after they cease formal participation in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of support services for young people, including mentor arrangements, will also be included in the AVC piloting process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Committee recommends that the matter of exploitative employment practices be referred to the Council of Ministers of Industrial Relations. (Page 58)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that young workers can be particularly vulnerable to exploitation from unscrupulous employers, both in the award and non-award areas. Through the Department of Industrial Relations, it has put in place an active program of information and education on rights and obligations under awards and, where necessary, enforcement of those rights and obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also ensured that workplace bargaining cannot be used to exploit workers, by including a `no disadvantage' test in provisions for certified work agreements. This test ensures that workplace agreements do not reduce the total package of an employee's award wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government has implemented legislation to provide minimum entitlements for all workers, including workers not covered by awards, regarding minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value, unfair dismissal and unpaid parental leave. The Government has also amended the Industrial Relations Act to give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction to review certain unfair contracts involving independent contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policy is that casual employment should be restricted to employment which is short-term, irregular or seasonal. The Government fully supports moves to extend access to permanent part-time employment through changes to award provisions. The referral of the issue of exploitative employment practices to the Ministers of Labour Advisory Council (MOLAC) to develop complementary Commonwealth-State approaches is supported. MOLAC's consideration of this issue would build on its earlier consideration of how permanent part-time work can be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Committee recommends that the National Labour Consultative Council develop proposals and devise strategies for the rapid expansion of job-sharing, modified work schedules and other measures with a view to achieving higher levels of participation in employment across the community. (Page 61)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the best method of dealing with the current unemployment situation is to achieve a sustained economic recovery. It has put in place policies to achieve sustainable long-term employment growth. Labour market programs for unemployed job seekers have been expanded to provide them with the skills necessary to gain employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are potential benefits from job sharing and related measures, especially if it is voluntary and fits in with agreed work arrangements. However, there are additional administrative and training costs involved in having more staff doing the same amount of work. Productivity is likely to be lower when currently unemployed people undertake some of the work normally done by fully qualified people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If people involuntarily work shorter hours on average, there may be more pressure for wage rises as people attempt to maintain current living standards. If weekly wages are maintained but average hours worked fall, labour costs faced by business will rise. This is likely to lead to a lower level of employment and an increase in inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After reviewing evidence from Australia and overseas, the Committee on Employment Opportunities has concluded that a general reduction in working hours is likely to lower national output and increase unemployment. However, the Committee also argued that arrangements which give individuals greater choice about working hours could have a beneficial effect on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current industrial relations system allows considerable flexibility for job sharing, part-time work, modified work schedules and other measures, while requiring that, taken as a whole, agreements do not disadvantage workers. Innovative working time arrangements introduced through award restructuring, and more recently workplace bargaining, provide the opportunity to develop work arrangements tailored to the needs of both employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is involved in activities to encourage the implementation of more flexible labour market strategies. For example, the Work and Family Unit in the Department of Industrial Relations is examining flexible working arrangements such as job sharing and permanent part time work to facilitate more flexible work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Labour Consultative Council (NLCC) is already considering flexible work practices in other contexts; for example, the recommendations of the Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Women in Australia, Half Way to Equal. However, the NLCC could play a useful role in developing additional strategies to expand the opportunities for job sharing, part time work and modified work schedules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to access the benefits available through workplace bargaining by developing innovative agreements that produce the best and fairest outcomes for both management and workers, including the achievement of higher levels of participation in employment across the entire community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. The Committee recommends that current proposals to move away from age-based to skill-based wages be encouraged among all parties to any wage determination process. (Page 68)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is piloting the implementation of the AVC training system which will involve a form of remuneration where pay is based on competency achieved and applied rather than age of the trainee. The pilots will test a variety of wage arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November 1990 MOLAC endorsed the Principles and Guidelines for Handling Change to Youth and Training Wages in the Context of Award Restructuring. These principles recommend a move away from age-based to competency-based wages for youth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interim industrial relations principles for AVC pilots have been agreed by the peak industrial councils. These principles will assist in ensuring that trainees involved in AVC pilots are treated equitably while protecting their competitive position in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is consulting through the NLCC and MOLAC to develop final principles to guide the implementation of competency-based wages for the AVC training system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The Committee recommends</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that, as a matter of urgency, the Industry Commission prepare a report to the Commonwealth Government on impediments to small business employment,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that the Government consider a 150 percent tax deduction (at the company tax rate) on new employment of people who have been unemployed for six months or more. This should remain in effect until the end of 1995 or until the present unemployment rate is halved, whichever is the sooner. (Page 70) </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the important role of small and medium businesses in generating employment and economic growth and has been actively reviewing and refining its policy settings to assist this sector of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a considerable amount of information on the major impediments to small business employment. Among those already identified are the unintended consequences of various Government regulations, general management skills and access to services and information on which to base management and investment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research by the Bureau of Industry Economics which is reported in its publication Small Business Review (1992) shows the growing importance of small business for employment. In Australia and other countries, there has been a small but persistent increase in the share of wage and salary earners represented by small business over the last two decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A conference on small business employment, sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), was held in Sydney in December 1993. The conference examined Australian and international case studies which illustrated issues affecting small business employment as well as possible policy responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government would welcome further information on impediments to small business, it is not clear that an Industry Commission Inquiry would add significantly to the current stock of knowledge or efforts currently under way. The Government considers that its resources are most usefully employed by responding to those impediments to small business efficiency and employment that have already been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On part (b) of the recommendation, the Government currently assists the long-term unemployed to return to the workforce through direct expenditure on labour market programs. This approach has a number of advantages over tax incentives in terms of equity and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour market programs can be tailored and interlinked to suit client needs. For example, training through JOBTRAIN can be followed up with a wage subsidy under JOBSTART to achieve a more effective outcome than under a single program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of labour market programs enables funding to be targeted to the most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax incentive to employ more workers would be limited to profitable enterprises since businesses which were not making profits (or which were carrying forward past losses) would be unable to access the taxation concession immediately (for example, some 60% of companies currently pay no tax). Even then, the benefit of the tax concession would not be available to the tax paying enterprise until the year following the year of income. That is, depending on when the returns are lodged with the Taxation Office, the cash flow benefits could be delayed by a year or more following the employment of the additional worker. In comparison, a wage subsidy is paid at the time of employment and so assists in meeting the cash flow of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The Committee recommends that the Government commission an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of wage subsidy schemes over the past decade, including where possible the subsequent employment history of subsidised young people for at least 12 months from the expiry of the subsidy. Further, the Committee recommends that the Government commission an independent evaluation of the recently introduced Career Start Traineeships. (Page 74)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of wage subsidies was referred to the Employment and Skills Formation Council of NBEET as part of the terms of reference in the preparation of advice for the AEC and MOVEET on the introduction of the AVC training system. The recommendations of the Council have been taken into account in the development of the AVC training system. The AEC and MOVEET, in endorsing the strategy for the introduction of the AVC training system, noted that the detailed consideration of the issue of wage subsidies is a matter for the Commonwealth to pursue in consultation with the States. Ministers also noted that the policy on employer subsidies could be adjusted in the light of experience in the running of the AVC pilots referred to under recommendation 2 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of wage subsidies was also addressed in the Report on the Training Costs of Award Restructuring (Deveson, 1990) and these recommendations have been taken into account in the development of the AVC training system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that wage subsidies associated with Career Start Traineeships, which serve as a bridge between current training arrangements and the introduction of the AVC training system, be evaluated through a separate evaluation process rather than being undertaken within the national AVC training evaluation. As with the AVC training evaluation, the report of which is expected to be available by July 1994, the results will be made publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET has recently conducted an evaluation of the JOBSTART program which provides wage subsidies of various amounts and durations for the employment of long term and disadvantaged youth and older jobseekers. The aim of the evaluation was to examine the overall effectiveness of the program and to identify any measures that may improve its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evaluation methodology included surveys to identify the impact of JOBSTART on the chances of the long term unemployed finding and retaining employment. These included a survey of a sample of JOBSTART participants. The survey collected data on their outcomes in the six months after ceasing JOBSTART. The experience of JOBSTART clients was compared with that of similar CES registrants who were not assisted by JOBSTART and of former participants in other labour market programs who subsequently gained unsubsidised employment. The evaluation found that JOBSTART has a positive impact on the chances of the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, securing employment. The final report of the evaluation is being prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The Committee recommends that the matter of overlapping wage subsidy schemes at State and Commonwealth level be referred to the Council of Ministers of Vocational Education, Employment and Training (MOVEET). (Page 75)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1991, Commonwealth and State Ministers of Employment Education and Training agreed to institute joint planning and consultative arrangements. Premiers and Chief Ministers, at their November 1991 meeting, agreed to "progressively withdraw" from the field of labour market programs generally. This acknowledged the primacy of Commonwealth interests in this area in view of its income support as well as its counter-cyclical responsibilities. Enactment of this agreement would remove the risk of "double-dipping" and duplication of effort. However, progress in rationalizing government services in the labour market programs area has been slow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The Committee recommends the establishment of a national employment corps, funded by the States and the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis, and managed by local or regional corps committees with input from young people, to provide paid employment in ventures relevant to local, regional or national needs and conditions. (Page 77)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government examined employment and training options for unemployed young people as part of the development of the National Employment and Training Plan for Young Australians. One of the options considered was similar to that proposed by the Committee. The Government concluded that it was preferable to develop a package of assistance which tightly linked employment with formal training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Government initiated the Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP) which provides a combination of formal training and practical experience for young unemployed people. The program is delivered through projects of community benefit involving landcare, environment, cultural heritage or conservation activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94, the Commonwealth will provide $65.3 million to fund some 10,000 participant places. Brokers who administer projects, including State and Local Governments and community groups, may provide some additional funding which will vary from project to project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Committee recommends an expansion of the Commonwealth's Disadvantaged Schools Program and the Students at Risk (STAR) Program. (Page 97)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, action under way in relation to STAR; Not supported in relation to Disadvantaged Schools Program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following an evaluation of the Students at Risk (STAR) Program, in July 1992 the Government announced the continuation of the Program for a further two years, 1993 and 1994, and its extension to the non-government sector with an additional $2 million a year. In the 1993-94 Budget the Government continued the Program to 1996 with funding of $13.6 million over 1995 and 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On present outlays the Program targets around 5,000 students. The total number of students leaving school before completing Year 12 (the Finn target group) is around 63,000 each year and they are 8-10 times more likely to become long-term unemployed than those who completed Year 12. The 1992 evaluation of the STAR Program pointed to its success as an early intervention strategy. STAR targets and reduces this feeder group by keeping the students at school. It has important labour market as well as educational impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the success of the Program in achieving its objectives and in view of its broader labour market as well as educational impacts, the Government has already announced the extension of the STAR Program to 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major reform of Commonwealth equity programs for schools was introduced in 1994. The National Equity Program for Schools (NEPS) will be a coherent equity program containing elements or components of the previous, disparate programs but drawn together more strategically to address national objectives and targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the NEPS structure, the Disadvantaged Schools Program (DSP) becomes the Disadvantaged Schools Component of the Equity Element and will be subject to broad banding of funds with other components within that element. STAR will become part of the National Priorities Element which will continue to be managed at the national level and, therefore, will not be subject to broad banding.   </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the new arrangements for the NEPS and the Disadvantaged Schools Component, it would not be appropriate for the Government to implement the Committee's recommendation in relation to the Disadvantaged Schools Program at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Committee recommends that the Australian Housing Council develop strategies for assisting homeless young people to acquire medium and long term accommodation. (Page 105)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Housing Council has not met since October 1991 and no meeting is currently planned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to address the plight of homeless young people. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Program and the Youth Social Justice Strategy, in particular, provide assistance to homeless young people including, in some cases, access to medium to long term accommodation to help them move towards independent living.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has secured an agreement with State Welfare Ministers to implement a Protocol between Commonwealth Departments and State/Territory Welfare Authorities on case management and referral procedures for unsupported young people under 16 years. The Protocol, implemented since 1 September 1993, aims to improve co-ordination of, and referral between, Commonwealth and State services for this group. Subject to privacy obligations, young people under 16 years who claim the Youth Homeless Allowance or the Student Homeless Rate of AUSTUDY will be referred by social workers in DSS and DEET to State welfare agencies for an assessment of their need for protective services and attendant support, including accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also aware of the need for better targeting of Commonwealth programs in the area of youth housing. It will review the options for young people living independently on low incomes in its National Youth Housing Strategy. The Strategy will cover issues such as the interaction of young people with the private rental market, student housing, the needs of homeless young people and the effects of income support policies and programs on housing options for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. The Committee recommends that income support should be increased to a level commensurate with the revised Henderson Poverty Line in the first instance. This is to be funded from savings arising from the 150 percent tax deduction initiative for new employment recommended above. (Page 143)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are limitations on the use of poverty lines such as the Henderson Poverty Line as a basis for policy formulation. For instance, such devices measure poverty relative to average community income rather than providing an absolute measure of need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current structure of income support for young people attempts to balance competing objectives and pressures including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the principle that parents should, where possible, retain primary responsibility for supporting their children under the age of 18;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the recognition that young people living with their parents generally have lower costs of living than those living independently; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to take into account prevailing differentials between adult and youth wages to ensure that young unemployed people have sufficient financial incentive to take up full-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government assists young people to continue in education and training and to make the transition from school to work through specifically targeted labour market, student assistance and training initiatives. Targeting of these is necessary to ensure that within the resources available those who most need the help receive it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering this recommendation, the total amount of support available to those who rely on income support needs to be taken into account:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job Search Allowance (JSA) recipients under 18 who are in receipt of the homeless/independent rates of allowance are eligible for rent assistance of up to $34 a week. Job Search Allowance/Newstart Allowance (JSA/NSA) recipients over 18 who are living away from home are also eligible for rent assistance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">students on AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY may supplement their income through earnings by up to $115 a week ($6,000 a year) before the rate of allowance is affected; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the introduction of the AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY supplement has given eligible tertiary students (although not secondary students or the unemployed) access to additional income of up to $57 a week in 1994.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Committee recommends that the Government commission research, possibly through the Institute of Family Studies, into the comparative costs of living of young people aged 16 and 17 and those aged 18 and above, and into the relationship between levels of income support and young people's decisions to leave home. (Page 147)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Department of Social Security the Social Policy Research Centre (SPRC) recently undertook research into the relative living costs of young unemployed people of different ages and in different living arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET presently conducts a longitudinal survey of young people on their education, employment, housing (including housing costs) and income (including types and amounts of income support received). The current survey does not collect information about other living costs or about `leave home' decisions. Inclusion of such questions in the survey will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. The Committee recommends that waiting periods for benefits be reduced. (Page 149)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waiting periods assist in targeting income support by requiring those with available funds to be more self reliant and encouraging close contact with the labour market during the initial period of unemployment. These principles remain relevant during times of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The education leaver waiting period encourages young people to continue in education by generally denying them access to income support during the long summer vacation. The waiting period also provides a clear signal to school leavers that income support will not normally be available until other options regarding education, training and employment have been explored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that many school leavers, particularly those from low income families, suffer a variety of difficulties during the immediate period after leaving school, the Government introduced a number of changes to waiting requirements in November 1992. Young people leaving secondary education are now eligible for Job Search Allowance/Sickness Allowance (JSA/SA) 13 weeks from the date they leave school or from 15 February in the subsequent year, whichever is earlier. This prevents young people who fail to register with the CES as soon as they leave education from experiencing an extended period without income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The waiting period is now waived for any education leavers who have been on income support within the previous 12 months. This reduces disincentives for unemployed people to undertake education/training courses of six months or longer duration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people who would otherwise qualify for special benefit because of financial hardship also have the waiting period waived and gain immediate access to JSA/SA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education leavers required to serve the full 13-week waiting period from date of claim (primarily those leaving tertiary education) may now have periods of part-time work, as well as full-time work, taken into account in assessing a reduction in the waiting period. This recognises that many of the job opportunities available to young people are now part-time or casual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the need for young people living without parental support to access secure accommodation, the 18 week rent assistance waiting period for homeless and independent young people under 18 was abolished on 20 March 1994. Waiting periods for all other eligible clients were abolished from March 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regarding those previously on income support, provisions for waiving the waiting period for clients reclaiming allowance after short periods of work have been simplified. Since September 1993, any claimant who has been in receipt of income support within the previous 13 weeks will not be required to serve a waiting period before becoming eligible for payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. The Committee recommends that CES and DEET introduce greater flexibility into activity/work test arrangements, at least while unemployment levels remain high. (Page 150)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Requires further investigation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To receive Job Search or Newstart allowance, all clients must show that they are taking reasonable steps to find suitable work or to improve their employment prospects. This may include applying for suitable jobs, contacting employers about possible vacancies, accepting reasonable offers of work or a place on a suitable training course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Committee on Employment Opportunities has supported the use of activity testing to ensure that the reciprocal obligations between the Government and the unemployed are maintained. In return for ongoing income support and job search assistance provided by the Government, the unemployed are expected to actively seek work. The Committee notes that even during downturns, some unemployed people do find jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many young unemployed people, especially those suffering particular workforce disadvantage such as early school leavers, those with literacy problems, homeless young people and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, need early and active assistance if they are not to become long-term unemployed. Activity testing is an integral part of a positive strategy to help young people establish an early attachment to the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For people aged 18 or above who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, a Newstart agreement needs to be signed in order to move on to Newstart Allowance. The agreement is a plan of action for the client and is negotiated on a one to one basis between the client and a CES officer. The agreement is responsive to the personal circumstances and skills of the client and takes into consideration labour market conditions affecting the individual young person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government considers that the existing activity/work test arrangements are already very flexible, it is examining alternative forms of activity for unemployed people. For example, the Government established the Community Activity Program in the 1993-94 Budget. A reference group established with the Program is to investigate alternative arrangements including the possibility of unemployed people undertaking work with community organisations as part of their agreement for receipt of JSA/NSA. Such an arrangement would be included as part of the Newstart agreement but would provide another avenue of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges comments in the Report that clients could be better informed about what constitutes other approved activity and will be advising clients more fully in improved Newstart brochures and pamphlets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The Committee recommends that the age of independence for AUSTUDY be reduced to 21 over the next four years (rather than to 22 over the next three years as currently planned). (Page 151)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that there are arguments for reducing the age of independence for students to 21 and that the parents of some young people might refuse to support their continued study. This must be set against the expectation in the community that in the main parents will support their children until they complete their education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of young people in continuous education will have completed study by age 22.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be significant resource costs in reducing the age of independence to 21. It is estimated that the cost of reducing the age of independence to 21 is about triple that of reducing it to 22 as announced in the 1992-93 Budget. The Government believes these resources are better targeted elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. The Committee recommends that the Australian Education Council of Ministers (AEC) examine means of coordinating eligibility criteria and administrative arrangements associated with payment of income support benefits for young people living along State borders. (Page 155)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear from the report what the major area of concern underlying this recommendation is. AUSTUDY eligibility criteria are the same across Australia. The reference to `concessions' in the text suggests that the concern relates to concessions provided by State Governments to the unemployed which vary between States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. The Committee recommends that DEET urgently review the criteria now in place for independent AUSTUDY. (Page 156)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The context of the recommendation implies that the criteria referred to are those for eligibility for the Student Homeless Rate of AUSTUDY, rather than the independent criteria based on being married, a parent or in the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current criteria for homelessness under AUSTUDY have to cater for people up to age 24 (although this will be reduced to age 23 in 1994 and to age 22 from 1995 onwards). The criteria are intended to ensure assistance is targeted at the most disadvantaged and do not encourage young people to leave home unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. The Committee recommends the concentration of income support payment arrangements in the Department of Social Security. (Page 156)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Departments of Employment, Education and Training and Social Security are aware that difficulties sometimes arise when individuals, particularly young homeless people, are required to transfer from DSS income support to AUSTUDY allowances. In recent years, administrative arrangements have been made to reduce the incidence of these problems. They include priority processing of JSA/NSA recipients who apply for AUSTUDY, development of a transfer certificate for DSS clients transferring to DEET and a streamlined acceptance process for pensioner clients seeking AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional measures to overcome disincentives for unemployed persons to take up education were announced in the 1993-94 Budget. They included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing JSA/NSA recipients who are undertaking CES approved training and education for up to six months to remain on DSS payments, rather than transferring to AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring that JSA/NSA recipients undertaking AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY courses of longer than 6 months are given priority in the assessment of their entitlement to AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY on the basis of their disadvantaged status; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">continuing to pay JSA/NSA to clients transferring to AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY for 3 weeks, pending determination of entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS and DEET are continuing to monitor the effects of interactions between AUSTUDY and DSS income support arrangements and will be making further improvements as necessary. Cooperation between DSS and DEET has been given further impetus by a protocol signed by the Departments and endorsed by Ministers in May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. The Committee recommends a unified youth income support payment for all eligible individuals under 21 whether they are unemployed or in full time study, with different levels for those living at home (for whom a parental means test would apply) and those living independently. (Page 157)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea of simplifying the system of income support payments to young people is attractive and could overcome some of the complexities in the Common Allowance Structure (CAS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present under the CAS the maximum rates of payment for AUSTUDY and JSA are aligned for those aged 16 to 20. However, a fully unified youth payment for people under 21 would need to take account of existing differences, some of which relate to the different purposes and natures of the payments. These include differences in eligibility, relativities and levels, definitions of homelessness and independence and income/assets testing. For instance, there is a more general preparedness to accept a student as dependent whereas entering the labour market is seen as more independent behaviour&mdash;consequently the age of independence has been higher for students than for the unemployed. Also tertiary AUSTUDY recipients have the option of increasing their rate of income support through the availability of the AUSTUDY Supplement. Other differences, such as the annual assessment of AUSTUDY eligibility versus the fortnightly assessment basis for JSA/NSA, could be difficult to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. The Committee recommends that the `poverty trap' and associated disincentives inherent in current income support arrangements be examined by the DSS as a matter of urgency. (Page 162)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: To be examined</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Poverty traps, or high effective marginal tax rates for people on income support arise from the interaction of the taxation system, withdrawal of fringe benefits available to low income earners and the income tests for income support. The Government acknowledges that they do provide a disincentive, particularly for short-term and casual work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing the rate at which income support is withdrawn as income increases would raise the level of income at which people are still eligible for payment. This would expand the number of people eligible for payments and increase Government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possible incentives and disincentives arising from income support arrangements are always a consideration in the development of new policy options. However, poverty traps are an unavoidable by-product of a targeted income support system and there are no easy solutions which would not involve significant increases in Government expenditure and some consequent loss of targeting efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Restoring Full Employment, the Government's Committee on Employment Opportunities has suggested a number of possible alterations to income support arrangements to encourage the unemployed to engage in part time and/or casual work without discouraging further search for full time work. They include easing the taper for withdrawal of income support as well as suggested changes applying to married couples, such as requiring each spouse to qualify for and receive individual unemployment allowances, subject to some form of joint income test at higher levels. A parenting allowance would be available for one partner of couples with young children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. The Committee recommends, as an interim measure, that the current `free' area of earned income before beneficiaries begin to lose benefits be extended to $100 per fortnight (in 1992 dollar terms), with parallel adjustments for income levels at which the dollar for dollar loss in benefits begins to apply and at which the benefit cuts out. (Page 163)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that part-time and casual work is becoming increasingly important for unemployed people to supplement their incomes and retain links with the paid workforce. A number of measures have already been implemented to improve incentives for DSS allowance recipients to undertake part-time or casual work. Since September 1993, maximum free areas for allowance recipients have been increased to $90 a fortnight for single persons and $110-160 a fortnight for married couples, depending on whether one or both partners report employment income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Committee on Employment Opportunities has argued that the income test could be amended further to provide a greater financial incentive for unemployed to seek part time work. As an example of the kinds of change that could be made, the Committee recommends reduction in the free area coupled with replacement of the 50 per cent and 100 per cent tapers with a single taper rate. The taper refers to the rate at which the unemployment allowance declines with increases in income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The Committee recommends that the earnings credit scheme, which is currently restricted to maximum rate aged pensioners, be extended to JSA/NSA beneficiaries. (Page 163)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, action under way</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An earnings credit of up to $500 for allowance recipients was introduced in March 1994 to improve incentives for clients to take up part-time and casual employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. The Committee recommends that, as a further incentive to participate in casual and part-time work, beneficiaries be allowed to retain fringe benefits for up to six months, as long term unemployed people are now able to do if they move to full time work. (Page 163)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported in principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an unemployed person takes up part-time work but retains entitlement to some allowance under the income test, he or she retains entitlement to a health care card and associated fringe benefits. Health care card entitlement may also be retained during short periods of more substantial employment (at present up to four weeks) even if allowance entitlement is lost. Currently, those in receipt of income support for 12 months or longer retain entitlement only to a health care card and associated fringe benefits for up to six months after commencing full-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States separately provide concessions to unemployment beneficiaries and new arrangements for those would be a matter for the States to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. The Committee recommends that the Government commission further research into the social and economic costs of unemployment, possibly through the funding of a researcher on attachment to the Brotherhood of St Laurence. (Page 165)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Already undertaken</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social and economic costs of unemployment were discussed as part of a comprehensive survey of unemployment in an EPAC Council Paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unemployment in Australia</EMPHASIS>. The Council Paper attributed a number of social problems to unemployment, including loss of self esteem, poor health, marriage breakdown, increased crime and the loss of skill and morale, especially among the long-term unemployed. The Council Paper also drew upon findings from a recent EPAC Discussion Paper (Junankar &amp; Kapuscinski, 1992) The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Costs of Unemployment in Australia</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Brotherhood of St Laurence has recently undertaken some research into long-term unemployment on behalf of the Committee on Employment Opportunities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the ongoing evaluation of the Newstart Strategy, DEET is conducting surveys of long-term unemployed clients. This work will focus on the assistance provided to and required by jobseekers and the impact of unemployment on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs which looked at the effects of the proposed treatment of capital gains and losses on listed securities under income tests for pensioners. The committee report made several recommendations, and I would like to comment on the government response. Firstly, the committee recommended that the implementation of this measure be postponed until June 1994. The reason why we made this recommendation was that it was necessary to allow pensioners to settle their affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should realise that there have been constant changes, including changes in emphasis, in this legislation and it has been extremely confusing for older people who need to budget carefully for the remaining years of their lives. The last thing they need to do is worry about whether their income will be adjusted according to the movement of their shares. It is important to realise that we are not talking about millionaires; we are talking about those pensioners and part pensioners who derive the other part of their income from shares. It is extremely destabilising for those ill or disabled people who have no-one to help them manage their financial affairs to be subjected to this stress. The government has not accommodated the committee's request that the implementation of this measure be postponed until June 1994. I think it is a great pity that the government has not seen fit to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to recommendation 2, that the review be undertaken, it is good that the government decided to have the review of the assets and income test. However, I draw the government's attention to the idea of effective accountable administration. That comes from the terms of reference of the pension incomes and assets test strategic review. When the committee looked at the way in which this measure was going to be implemented, we were extremely concerned that a quarterly review of pensioners' incomes would lead to a need for more staff in the department. Ultimately, the need for more staff and the proposed blow-out in the budget could defeat the objective of saving money. So one measure could very well counterbalance the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 3 is that the review report its findings to parliament in April 1994. We were advised that it was not possible to report to parliament by April 1994. The review's final report is expected by September 1994. It is a great pity that the report is to be delayed until September 1994. Given that the changes were announced in September 1993, and given the weight of opinion against the change in any case, this delay simply means that there is further confusion and chaos for the pensioners who are involved. I point out that the Senate standing committee received 200 submissions from interested groups, and all of the groups were against the changes in the first place. To impose a further period of delay and uncertainty over the way people's incomes are to be assessed can only cause concern to many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 4 is that there is to be a review of the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the minor income adjustment. This means that the benefit to the client and the accuracy of assessment will be looked at. As I said, given the fact that there is to be a quarterly review, one can only hope that this is looked at very carefully. However, the coalition's concerns, which were contained in our dissenting report as an addendum to the additional report, still remain. The savings are based on poor quality data and an excessively high rate of return has been calculated which would give an artificial view of the way in which people's incomes would rise or fall. Also there is an assumption that the growth in investments will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that this legislation was mooted, the share market had reached a very high point. To imagine that that growth in investments would be maintained is, in my view, erroneous. The measure is still totally unfair to those older people who have made a genuine attempt to save to provide incomes in the later years of their lives. In the coalition's view, the net result of this measure can only make more citizens dependent on the pension. Therefore, it will defeat the objective of the legislation in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the report that the government has now responded to, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: Our Future</EMPHASIS>. This report was a landmark report in terms of its recommendations concerning the plight of youth trying to find jobs in our system, particularly young people aged 15 to 24 years. We conducted extensive surveys across the community. We held hearings right around Australia. We debated our recommendations under the shadow of the 1993 federal election, when the two major parties were heading in very different directions of policy. Despite this we were able, before Christmas 1992, to come up with a unanimous report covering a great number of recommendations on what should happen in the area of youth unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay special tribute to the chairman of that committee, the Hon. Terry Aulich, who was the leading light in guiding us through that difficult time of resolving our different points of view. I also wish to thank Karen Sowada, the Australian Democrats spokesperson on education. I had a similar position for the coalition. The three of us, and the other members of the committee, were able to come up with unanimous recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it should dismay the Senate that it has taken the government until May 1994 to respond to this report that was tabled in the Senate in December 1992. It should have taken a maximum of three months to respond to the recommendations that we brought down. It is callous in the extreme that this government, having 30 well-researched recommendations before it from a Senate committee, has chosen to let it lie for that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recorded daily in our papers and on the news the plight of the youth unemployed in this country. We hear daily examples of despair and poverty and, over the time of the recession, a doubling of the suicide rate. Yet the government, having a report with 30 recommendations, dithers for almost two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then minister was a little apologetic. In May 1993 the committee received a note from the minister apologising for the delay and promising a response before the budget; that is, the 1993 budget. We are up to the 1994 budget and we have just received this response to an issue that is of great importance to the Australian people. Any survey around Australia would show that what concerns people most is the level of unemployment. What distresses people most within that is youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have an example of the government neglecting a major problem in the economy, a problem which we would all recall it has created through the recession that we had to have. Senator Short referred to that earlier today in the matter of public importance debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been comment that adds to this callousness, that a government chooses the level of unemployment that it wants. This government has chosen this high level of unemployment, including youth unemployment, in our economy by the sorts of policies it has adopted. It has adopted a policy regime with high levels of business taxes&mdash;a job killer. Before the last election we promised to get rid of payroll tax. That would have been a great job creator. This government has done nothing but continue, through all its levies, to add to that and kill off jobs, particularly for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sham that goes before us in labour market reform at the moment is just that. The government has not undertaken genuine enterprise bargaining; but that is the sort of measure that is needed to boost productivity and give jobs to young people. It could have chosen to reform the economy more rapidly, as New Zealand did. New Zealand is now reaping the benefits of that. But this government has not done that. What it has done&mdash;particularly because of union objections in areas such as the waterfront&mdash;is keep micro-economic reform to a snail's pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us a response from the government to our report on doing something positive about youth unemployment. Over the time in which the government has taken to respond to what was said in the Senate committee report, in the period between December 1992 and April 1994, the number of long-term unemployed, which includes a lot of youth, has gone from 340,000 to 351,000. During this period of delay there have been some appalling social consequences of the government's callous attitude in this area and its lack of response to our report. The youth suicide rate in Australia is the highest in the world, and double what it was before the recession. The divorce rate and the marriage rate are now equal. Reports from the police show that violent attacks are up 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should have been doing something from the time the committee made its recommendations, but it has let youth drift in poverty and despair, and these other social consequences are taking hold in this country as an economic underclass develops. The tragedy for our future is that a large part of that underclass happens to be the youth of our country, who should be the hope for the future but who are in the depths of despair over what this government's policy has done for the youth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper will address many of the issues raised by the Senate committee. One would perhaps be cynical in  assuming that the government has dithered around for such a long time because a fair way back it said, `We are going to bring down a white paper on unemployment and we will fix this all up at that point in time.' That is cold comfort for the many out there who are waiting for the government to provide some sort of leadership in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news about this report, at last, is that the response goes some way towards addressing its recommendations. Of the 30 recommendations, 16 are agreed to in principle or action is under way; six are to be examined further; and eight have been disagreed with. If the government is in a position where it agrees with more than half the report, then it begs the questions: why did it take so long to do it, and why has it left the youth of this country languishing and waiting for adequate responses and policies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One recommendation agreed to in principle is the expansion of the training in retail and commerce program, otherwise known as the TRAC program. The committee visited one organisation implementing this program in my home city of Newcastle. It found that this initiative by the Dusseldorp Foundation, which is a private concern, had come up with a scheme whereby students could study for the HSC not only in an academic sense but also out in the workplace and have credit towards their HSC in New South Wales. This was an extremely successful scheme. Since the pilot scheme which we saw at the time we were collecting evidence, the scheme has become widespread across New South Wales. It is an example of the sort of scheme that other states could perhaps emulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government rejects the need to look at labour market  prospects for graduates and the increasing level of tertiary qualifications. One wonders why it has rejected that. One of the unfortunate things about this government's policy of trying to create a clever country is that it is neglecting that very end of the labour market that has the greatest hope of making us a clever country. We have enormous wastage in the sense that people spend all this time training in universities and the government then creates a situation where those people cannot go forward and use that training. That is a tremendous brake on the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government feels that it is not appropriate for ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, to look at education and training re-entry points, or the extension of the AVC to 20- to 24-year-olds. In a flexible labour market&mdash;in a market where people move in and out of jobs, where jobs that are required in the economy change all the time, and where there is a need for constant updating of skills and retraining&mdash;one wonders why the government has not agreed to that recommendation. It has agreed to a review of ANTA, established last year, after two years. This is very much in line with other work the committee has done in relation to ANTA. We are keeping a watching brief on it. We believe that it has enormous potential for improving training levels and the prospects of youth in our country, but only if it is developed in an appropriate way. Hence, we are going to be constantly monitoring what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater flexibility for jobstart allowance recipients to do volunteer work was agreed to in principle. But the government has warned of community expectation that unemployment payments will be made only to those who are actively seeking paid employment. One wonders why the government is being so narrow in its interpretation. Volunteer work is something which is undertaken by a huge number of Australians. It is something that should be encouraged, particularly for young people who have been trained and have skills. There are no jobs out there for them. If they can be redirected and encouraged by government policy into volunteer work, we will find that they will develop further skills and that this will give them a better opportunity for jobs later. More important than that, they are undertaking community service. This sort of thing should be encouraged, anyway. Not only is it good for the community but it is also excellent for their self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has stated that job sharing and modified work schedules are to be examined. We have had an inquiry and we have come up with that recommendation. After the delay of about 18 months, the government has decided that it will examine the recommendation further. Why does it need to? Why can it not come out with a harder policy on this matter? This government only has to look at what the New South Wales government has done in its very innovative job sharing arrangements through the Public Service to see how effective this can be&mdash;not only for the people working in the sector but also for the clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife works in the area of child welfare. She is on a job share arrangement with another lady. When she originally proposed that arrangement about eight years ago, it was said  that the Public Service would not do that and that it would not work. In New South Wales, the government bit the bullet and has undertaken job sharing. Job sharing shares the work around more. More people get employed. More people get an income. More people get their self-esteem boosted. For youth, it is an opportunity for expanding work opportunities as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in response to another recommendation, has agreed to an independent evaluation for wage subsidies, including those who are 12 months away from the finish of a program. Wage subsidies, of course, are a big part of what the government is proposing in trying to solve the unemployment problem. One wonders again why its response is so weak in saying that it will agree to an independent evaluation. If the government has had 18 months to study this report, why has it not had people working on it and coming up with a more substantial recommendation in a very detailed fashion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> showed last night how poorly DEET is doing in terms of its follow-up and information gathering on the effectiveness of its current labour market programs, including the job subsidy program I have just mentioned, along with others. Now, with the white paper, the government wants to expand DEET's responsibilities in this area even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would wonder why the government is doing this, given the track record so far. In terms of government policy, one possible light out there is what has been mooted as letting the private sector compete with the inefficient Commonwealth Employment Service. Such a move could help expand job opportunities for young people, but it has been a long time coming. It has been a long time since we brought down this report, and it has been a long time since the start of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee welcomes the government response to our report&mdash;in part. We welcome the fact that it is acting on a number of the recommendations. But given that the ones it has rejected had cross-party support, it is disappointing that the government has either pushed them off to further inquiries or rejected them outright. Given that the government has been considering this report for 18 months, one would have thought that it could have come up with a much more constructive response to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We await with great interest the developments following the release of the white paper tomorrow. Let us hope that it contains a much better deal for the youth of our country. The government's slowness in responding to our report seems to indicate that it is not putting a high priority on youth unemployment. Let us hope that what comes out of tomorrow's white paper gives Australian youth some hope for the future. </PARA>

I am no longer a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I wondered what had happened to this particular report, because it was brought down in December 1992. I remember the amount of work that went into it, the hearings that we had and the travelling that we did around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I briefly flicked through the report this afternoon, I started to remember the plight of the young people that came before us and gave evidence, and the different places we visited. Senator Tierney has referred to some. I remember very well the tales of woe and some of the examples of the bandaid solutions that were being carried out in places like Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was produced in 1992, after a lot of work by our committee secretary and his helpers. I am sure that Brenton Holmes, the secretary, along with Mary Lindsay, Rosemary Brissenden, Doug Hynd and Kathleen Griffiths, would have wondered, as we did, why it has taken so long for the government to respond to this report. The introduction to the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth unemployment is everybody's problem. As a society we have been slow to acknowledge that this is so. Some have still to be convinced. It is the Committee's hope that this Report will assist in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a disgrace that it has taken the government 16 months to respond to this report dealing with one of the most serious problems facing our nation. It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that last year&mdash;at the time the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, announced that the white paper was coming forward&mdash;all the government could come up with was an inquiry into unemployment, but at that time it had this well-researched document of some 250 pages with evidence from all over Australia, from different groups in different areas in different states, which would have gone a long way towards giving it some data on which to base changes to the way things are happening so as to help these 15- to 24-year-olds in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixteen months later we have a response. I do not believe the response is what anybody on that committee would have expected. When we were gathering evidence for this report we received overwhelming evidence of frustration, alienation and a growing lack of self-esteem amongst young people as a result of unemployment. It came to our attention that the inevitable consequence is that the young people involved experience withdrawal and depression. Many of the experts who appeared before our committee described an identifiable link between the feelings of alienation and the low self-esteem being experienced by the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the increasing levels of drug and alcohol abuse which are brought about by low self-esteem. We all know that drug and alcohol abuse amongst young Australians has led to an increasing number of social and health problems. I do not believe that has improved since 1992 in any shape or form. Our report showed that one in three deaths amongst people aged between 15 and 24 was drug related, with alcohol responsible for about three-quarters of these, largely through road accidents. Those were some of the things we were concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the deliberations I have talked about which resulted in this 250-page report, we came up with 36 recommendations. One has to ask: how serious is the government about finding solutions to the many problems associated with youth unemployment? I do not believe it is serious at all, when we consider its appalling record in relation to this report. To its shame, in the 16 months which have transpired since the report was tabled, the government has indicated that only nine of the recommendations have been implemented&mdash;nine out of 36. It has also indicated that six of the recommendations are still to be examined and, therefore, have been ignored over the same period. One would not have thought that, after all that time, there would still be six recommendations that have not yet been looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most damning statistic to emerge from this government response on the effects of unemployment on young people is that nine of the recommendations agreed to by the bipartisan parliamentary committee have been rejected outright by the government. Not only does the government's response show that it has turned its back on the young unemployed of this country, but it also shows that the government has chosen to turn its back on Senators Sherry, Foreman and Zakharov, who endorsed in full the recommendations which appear in this report. Knowing him as I do, I can only draw the conclusion that former Senator Terry Aulich, the then chairman of the committee, must be terribly disappointed that so few of the recommendations which he worked so hard for have actually been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to take an opportunity like this to place on the public record the types of recommendations made by the committee which have been rejected by the government. I suppose, as Senator Tierney said, that the fact that some have been implemented is of some comfort, but I think it important to put on the record the ones that have been rejected. People need to understand that the committee's recommendations followed a considered effort, much deliberation and a lot of hard work put into dealing with this most difficult problem. If politicians acting in a bipartisan way cannot come up with some well-considered recommendations, I do not know who can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us would expect the government to embrace recommendations that assist young people but, from looking at the responses, I do not think that is the case. The government rejected the committee's recommendation to increase income support for the young unemployed, and it also rejected the proposal to reduce the waiting period for benefits. It rejected the recommendation to reduce the age for Austudy independence, which would have allowed many thousands of young people to stay in school to complete their education. These are critical factors when dealing with the problem of youth unemployment, and they have all been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not stop there. The government has also chosen to ignore recommendations to concentrate income support payments under the management of the Department of Social Security. I did not see the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report last night which was mentioned just a moment ago by Senator Tierney&mdash;I had other things on my mind&mdash;but it appears that revelations by that report show massive problems within DEET. It also showed that the committee's recommendations made some 16 months ago were somewhat prophetic when we pointed out that income support payments should come under the Department of Social Security. We could see 16 months ago just how hopeless DEET was, and here we are 16 months down the track still finding the same problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures to remove impediments to greater employment by small business, and a tax deduction scheme to encourage the hiring of the long-term unemployed were also ignored, as were greater assistance for the disadvantaged schools and attempts to provide an easier path to employment for graduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response to this report on the implications of high levels of unemployment among young people will further add to the now widely recognised perception that Mr Keating and his colleagues have become desensitised to youth unemployment. The government is unable to copy, and it appears to lack any genuine conviction to do anything about addressing the problem. I think the saddest indictment is that it is no coincidence that deaths amongst young males recorded as suicide have increased by 100 per cent since the 1960s. Suicide is related to one in seven deaths amongst young males today compared with one in 20 in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told at our hearings that young Australians are now committing suicide at the rate of one per day and that rural areas were experiencing a drastic increase in this problem. My own state of Tasmania probably has the worst incidence of youth unemployment. It also has the worst incidence of youth suicide. That is something that none of us can be very proud of. I think we should take note that many ordinary young Australians are crying out for assistance. All they really want is a job and some purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very disappointing that, as I said earlier, after spending so much time and putting in so much effort on trying to advise the government in a bipartisan way to combat some of these problems, after 16 months all the government has done is adopt nine recommendations and the other 27 are either still being looked at or totally ignored. As a former member of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I believe it is a tragedy that this government continues to ignore the cries for help from the young people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighteen months after this report was brought down we now get a very belated response. As we go through the various recommendations, we find so many of them are either not supported, supported in principle&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;or to be further examined. Under the chairmanship of Senator Aulich, the committee brought down this unanimous report. It was brought down in good faith, taking into account the many young people who appeared before the committee. In good faith, those people gave information and evidence as to how they saw their problems and how we, this committee, as the representatives of this Senate and the federal parliament, should act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To let this report go so long&mdash;in effect, gathering dust&mdash;and then find that so many of the recommendations are virtually ignored can only be described, in my view, as a total lack of consideration and commitment by the government to the youth unemployment problems in this country. In fact, it has to be described as a disgrace as a response that was required to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular recommendation I wish to deal with was raised by many employers at our hearings. It was also supported, I might add, by the youth who gave evidence. It is recommendation 11 relating to giving real incentive to business to address youth unemployment. I want to highlight that recommendation because I believe it could have been put in place very quickly and effectively, and it would have been targeted at the unemployed. Recommendation 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that, as a matter of urgency, the Industry Commission prepare a report to the Commonwealth Government on impediments to small business employment, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that the Government consider a 150 percent tax deduction (at the company tax rate) on new employment of people who have been unemployed for six months or more. This should remain in effect until the end of 1995 or until the present unemployment rate is halved, whichever is the sooner.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that type of swift action which can address a problem. It does not involve all the problems that we have heard about recently in estimates committee hearings with the administration of programs through DEET and the CES. They have been raised many times and, in some instances, I believe, have bordered on fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation was a straight-out, incentive based proposal which the government has not supported. It would have gone directly to the heart of the problem. It would have gone directly to small business in particular. I believe there are some 900,000 small businesses in this country and, if each one of them could employ one more person, all of a sudden our unemployment problem would become non-existent. If only half of them could employ one person, that would take 450,000 to 500,000 people off the dole and give them their pride back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless this government is prepared to address the unemployment problem with direct measures&mdash;not indirect, roundabout, mickey mouse ways&mdash;we will have to live with the ever increasing rates of unemployment. Had this recommendation, of all the recommendations, been addressed 18 months ago, so many people would not now be in that terrible position of being long-term unemployed. Unfortunately, in the eyes of many, and through no fault of their own, they have fallen behind the pace in the employment stakes and have become, not unemployable, but difficult to employ in the current economic circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the introduction of this bill last December the then health minister made it clear that it was the government's intention that the bill should be the subject of public comment and possible amendment. The government recognises that the transfer of investigative powers from the Australian Federal Police to the Health Insurance Commission is a serious step; a serious step, as was pointed out in the second reading speech, that we have taken not for lack of confidence in the Australian Federal Police, but for reasons of getting greater effectiveness in the investigation of fraud against Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record on Medicare fraud investigation and prosecution has not been good and has been the subject of much criticism, especially from various parliamentary committees. This bill seeks to redress that shortcoming by giving the Health Insurance Commission the necessary tools to conduct investigations. There is a balance to be struck between the powers of the investigators and the rights of the investigated, especially where the privacy of patients may be intruded upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear from public comment in submissions to the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that a number of individuals and organisations, including the Australian Medical Association, which has been intimately involved in the development of the proposals for the bill, considered that the balance in the bill was wrong. The principal concerns were two-fold: that the powers to be granted to the Health Insurance Commission were not sufficiently restricted to the investigation of Medicare fraud, and that there was insufficient protection for the privacy of patient records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments now proposed deal with those issues. Firstly, the investigative powers in the new part IID proposed to be inserted in the Health Insurance Commission Act may only be used on the personal authorisation of the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission. In practice, investigations using these powers will only be authorised after consideration of each case by the Health Insurance Commission's national case management committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the powers in the proposed section 8N of the Health Insurance Commission Act to require information, and in new section 8S of the same act to enter premises, are restricted to where there is a reasonable suspicion of a medical fraud offence. Thirdly, those same powers do not extend to patients' clinical records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the search and seizure power in new division 4 of the Health Insurance Commission Act, which is modelled on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994, which was recently passed by the Senate, have the added requirement that a patient whose clinical record has been searched or seized must be told of that fact if it would not prejudice the investigation, and if he or she can be found on reasonable inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee, by a majority, was satisfied that the measures contained in the bill are necessary. The committee acknowledged that the investigation of fraud is notoriously difficult and that the Health Insurance Commission is the only agency that adequately understands the technical and legal complexities governing the operation of the medical benefits schedule in the legislation. The committee concluded that the Health Insurance Commission was the only agency which could concentrate its endeavours exclusively on the investigation of Medicare abuse and recommended that the bill be enacted incorporating the amendments that the government has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA has confirmed its support for the general thrust of the legislation and indicated that the amendments proposed meet its major concerns with the original bill. I also understand that the Privacy Commissioner has welcomed the changes proposed and indicated that they meet to a significant degree the concerns that he raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the Senate committee's hearing, two other issues were raised which I should deal with as they have not resulted in government amendments, but they are deserving of comment. Firstly, there was a concern that the Health Insurance Commission should report on its activities under these new provisions. I am happy to give the chamber an undertaking that the Health Insurance Commission's annual report will include material on the use of the powers of investigation, including statistics on the number of authorisations made under new section 8KA of the Health Insurance Commission Act, the number of notices given under new section 8N of the same act, the number of entries made under new section 8S, and the number of warrants sought and executed under new division 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there was reference to the joint Australian Federal Police/Law Council of Australia guidelines for the execution of warrants where legal professional privilege might be claimed, and the suggestion that similar guidelines might be put into law in this case. I am happy to ensure that there are consultations between the Health Insurance Commission and the AMA for the purpose of achieving a simulus modus vivendi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think it ought to be recognised that documents the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege have been specifically found by the High Court not to be the subject of a search warrant; whereas claims for privilege based on the professional duty of confidence to clients, expressly including doctor/patient confidentiality, have not been found to exclude documents from a search warrant. In addition, the Australian Federal Police/Law Council of Australia guidelines referred to have operated successfully for over seven years without a legislative base, so I see no need for a legislative base here. </PARA>

While the 60 days in the Democrats' amendment may be a bit tight, the sense of it is to put a restriction on an open-ended `has been' back forever and to deal with a realistic view of what has got to be the time taken to follow up and, with restrictions of this bill, too, of how to behave sensibly and appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is a review of a very important advisory body to the federal government on employment, education and training&mdash;and, indeed, on research, languages and literacy, and overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost six years ago that NBEET was established and, on behalf of the opposition, I moved that there be a review of this new advisory body&mdash;the National Board for Employment, Education and Training&mdash;after five years. This was due in mid-1993 but, because of the pending March election, the minister put it off for a year. Now we have it in front of us and, being the one who called for this review, I am glad to be able to respond to it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four things I wish to say&mdash;three critical and the largest quite confirming of the positive findings of Professor Wiltshire. The first and broadest criticism is one that I have held for this whole six-year period of the debate on NBEET. I remind the Senate that NBEET replaced the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, the Schools Commission and the commission that looked after Commonwealth initiatives for technical and further education, and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some strengths in the arrangements that had been in place up until 1987. NBEET was established in this new way by then Minister Dawkins and we had reservations about whether or not all of the strengths that had been in the advisory bodies prior to that time would, in fact, be taken up by the new organisation&mdash;the board&mdash;and the councils underneath the board. I remain unconvinced that the strengths of the preceding bodies have, in fact, been built into NBEET. I believe that this review has not sufficiently referred to the bodies that existed six or 20 years ago which established enormous credibility as independent advisory bodies to the Commonwealth government on education matters and which had the confidence of education institutions around this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reference to this in the executive summary  which says that the effectiveness of NBEET depends largely on the extent to which ministers use it. This is the wrong tone of voice altogether in Professor Wiltshire's introduction. In my view, advisory bodies should not be at the whim of ministers or only be effective to the extent that ministers use them. I continue that criticism with regard to the first recommendation that matters are to be submitted to the minister, and that budgeting considerations are to conform with DEET's consideration, and part (d) of recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second criticism relates to the insufficient focus upon technical and further education or, as many would rightly describe it now, vocational education. Some responsibilities are given to the Higher Education Council and some to the Employment and Skills Formation Council, and these two councils together are to make sure that vocational education is properly reviewed in advice to the minister. There is proper reference to ANTA and that I take on board. But I see a danger that TAFE will fall between two stools in the giving of responsibility to two councils. The third point relates to recommendation 9 but I am out of time and I will have to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments of my colleague Senator Teague on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. This body is really part of the failed national unified system that former Senator Dawkins established in 1987. It was to be an advisory body that is really part of a wider web of authority which has delivered to the universities a lot less autonomy. Having said that, we have 88 recommendations here to reform what I believe is a very faulty concept. Senator Teague has gone into great detail in explaining why it is a faulty concept and why what it has replaced worked much better than this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to some of the key recommendations that I believe are important for this reform. First of all, there is the performance appraisal system for NBEET outcomes. This is a very useful recommendation because my observation of the output of NBEET is that its reporting is very light, it does not go into any great depth and it has not been, in terms of the documents it has submitted to this parliament, particularly useful. Therefore, a performance appraisal system would be very good. But it must really also go hand in hand with an increase in resources for NBEET if it is to do the job properly. The statutory authorities it replaced had much more extensive resources and were, therefore, able to give much more professional advice to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revision of the composition of NBEET I found rather intriguing. It has been extended to include further members. One would have thought that this would perhaps dilute the influence of the body&mdash;and this criticism has been made from the university sector&mdash;but, rather intriguingly, the structure has also been extended to include members of the government and members of the opposition. The universities are not very happy about this at all because they believe it should be people with expertise in the specific field, and they have complained that this change actually politicises the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, our fundamental criticism is the lack of expertise of this body which will be exacerbated by its dilution and extension. There is considerable doubt whether the body, even if reformed along the lines indicated by Professor Wiltshire, will do the job that is needed. We have great movement in this whole area into the international marketplace. Some of the greatest challenges facing education are intersectorial. It is doubtful whether the proposed structure will be able to meet that challenge because of lack of expertise and resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to say that NBEET is a concept worth retaining but in a form made more adaptable to changing issues and circumstances. Senator Teague and I probably would not agree with that statement by the committee. Both of us would prefer a return to statutory authorities to loosen the grip of government, not only by NBEET but also DEET, over some of our educational institutions, particularly in the university sector. The report also says that the recommendations of this review produce slightly more complexity but are targeted mainly at flexibility, acknowledging universality to be NBEET's greatest need. We should not be increasing complexity but reducing it. Already, the education institutions have too many masters. The other day I was sitting in the office of a vice-chancellor who said that he spends most of his time jumping through government hoops. Perhaps that recommendation as well is heading completely in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Vice-chancellors Committee is not very happy about the report. It has rejected the increase in the membership of the board and the politicisation of the board. Although Professor Wiltshire is puzzled and staggered by the vice-chancellors' response and says they fear losing political dominance, they really fear losing autonomy, and this report will extend that loss. </PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion with pleasure as a South Australian senator and obviously one representing a state which has two very significant manufacturers. This report is an opportunity to congratulate the automotive industry on its very significant progress in recent years. As the report notes, there was a 17 per cent increase in productivity in this industry in 1993 and a 31 per cent increase in productivity over the last two years, which is a tremendous result and a great credit to the industry. It just shows what can be done when the industry is faced with tariff reductions. In the last six years the industry has had a tariff reduction of one third and it has met the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the doomsayers who said the industry would go down the gurgler because of a reduction in tariffs, this result is the answer. It is to the government's credit that it bit the bullet on tariffs because it had confidence that the industry could respond. The report notes that the quality of Australian produced motor vehicles has increased significantly. Everyone who drives an Australian car would recognise the fantastic increase in quality that the companies have achieved, particularly Mitsubishi and General Motors in my own state. The quality of their products and the workmanship of Australian workers is to be commended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. They are producing world quality cars. It is important to note that, when some of our Australian industries are exposed to competition and face the real world, they can respond. Workers and management can respond to produce real quality products. It demonstrates the virtues of freer trade and greater competition. The results in this industry, as highlighted in this report, are a classic example of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the real winners&mdash;the people about whom we should be most concerned&mdash;are Australian consumers. They are getting a better product for their money. The report notes that car affordability has declined over the past 10 years and is continuing to decline, partly due to the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. That must be a matter of considerable concern. The report notes that is a matter with which the industry must grapple if it is to overcome the fact that we have one of the oldest car fleets in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, on page 9 the report notes the role of the government. It says that governments determine a significant part of the cost structure of the industry through taxing charges and the cost of government-owned enterprises in transport, power, et cetera. The report says that it is just as important that efficiency gains are made and passed on in this area as in any other. To that I say, `Hear! Hear!' I hope that the government takes note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this body will understate the importance of what it is saying. However, as we said today in the MPI and in commenting on the white paper on employment, nothing could be more important than the government taking careful note of the impact it has through its taxes and charges and its role in the ownership and regulation of various instrumentalities which affect the costs of production of things like motor vehicles. That is how we will get gains for consumers and employees in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I hope that the government takes careful note of what the industry says because, as tariffs are being reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000, it will be critical that the government matches those tariff reductions with reductions in its effect on the cost of production, particularly in the motor vehicle area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 November 1993, Mr Raymond Gildare, Mr Michael Lavarch, and Mr John Dawkins were appointed directors of Freehill Hollingdale and Page Holdings Pty Ltd, or so one might believe from the documents filed with the Australian Securities Commission. The documents were, in fact, quite totally and utterly incorrect. They were filed by Mr Gildare to highlight a glaring flaw in our corporations legislation and in the forms that the ASC requires people to fill in when there is a change of directorship of a company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That flaw is that a form 304 is filed along with the minutes of the meeting at which the directors were appointed to the company. Of course, Mr Gildare was not a director; he was not the chairman of Freehill Hollingdale and Page Holdings Pty Ltd, Mr Michael Lavarch had not filed a consent and Mr John Dawkins had not filed a consent; but one does not have to show those consents to file the form. It would be possible for me to appoint Senator Jones or Senator Collins to be a director of any company provided I file the necessary form and a document which purports to be a set of minutes of a meeting of directors which says that they produced a consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a reason why Mr Gildare did this, and that is because Mr Gildare has been the victim of a similar situation. Unlike the case of Mr Lavarch and Mr Dawkins where the purported change of directorship was immediately rectified by the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Gildare has suffered for a number of years now because he is just an ordinary Australian. Except in one respect: Mr Gildare was the inventor of a solar airconditioning system, the patent to which is very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that in 1988 Mr Gildare and his father were appointed directors of a company which was to be a joint venture company. Mr Gildare had invented this particular solar airconditioning system. He had been approached by an American gentleman called Mr Rad who proposed a joint venture. The whole plan was that Mr Rad would put up the money, Mr Gildare would put up the patents, they would do the necessary research and development and everybody would make a lot of money. Except that is not quite how it worked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm of solicitors working for Mr Rad filed the necessary documents to make Mr William Patrick Gildare, Mr Raymond William Gildare and Mr Donald McClaverty directors of a company called Sanvel Pty Ltd. However, unbeknownst to them, the company did not end up with the only assets, which were, of course, the patents; it ended up with all the liabilities. The patents ended up elsewhere. They ended up in the possession of Mr Rad, who did not cough up the money. At the time the meeting is purported to have taken place, both William Patrick Gildare and Raymond Patrick Gildare, I understand, had not produced consents to act as directors. But, of course, all they had to do was file the appropriate documents and say that they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut a long story short, the company ended up with no assets and a lot of liabilities. It spent some considerable time trading whilst insolvent, during which period Mr Gildare was a director and was, therefore, technically liable and may have committed an offence under the Companies Code and now the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company eventually went into liquidation. Mr Gildare has spent a considerable amount of time and money obtaining a judgment in the United States against Mr Babak Farin Rad and a company called Raythorn Ltd, which, I understand, is an Isle of Man company. That judgment results from the fraudulent activities in relation to Sanvel and the defrauding of Mr Gildare and two Australian companies&mdash;Trend Research Ltd and Motive Holdings Pty Ltd&mdash;of patents and rights in relation to those patents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A judgment was issued by the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida, on 2 September 1990 in the amount of $3.25 million. In spite of that, Mr Gildare has not seen a cent. He has coughed up a lot of money and he cannot get anybody to act because, it seems, the Australian Securities Commission takes the view that there is absolutely nothing that constitutes an offence which it might have to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter here from the commission dated 11 December 1992 to Mr Gildare which I will seek leave to table in a moment. I have the documents which purport to be minutes of a meeting of directors held on the ninth floor of Australia Place, 15-17 William Street, Perth, Western Australia, on 27 June 1988. I will seek leave to table that document in a moment. I have a letter from Dr Carmen Lawrence, when she was Premier, to Mr Gildare, indicating that the matter could not be followed up by the Western Australian police as Mr Rad was not a director of an Australian company, nor resident in Australia. I have the judgment and I have a letter from Mr Tuckwell of Messrs Boyd Partners, chartered accountants in Victoria, who is the liquidator of Sanvel Pty Ltd. He notes in the report made to the Australian Securities Commission some two pages of possible offences that need to be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the Australian Securities Commission, the Federal Police or the Western Australian police have a responsibility to follow up these matters. I will be writing very shortly to the Western Australian police suggesting that they too have a responsibility in this matter. I do not think the advice offered by the then Premier&mdash;that because Mr Rad was not resident in Australia nor a director of any other Australian companies, he is not responsible for any criminal acts&mdash;is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the test of territoriality is somewhat different from that and that it is merely sufficient to show that Mr Rad participated in a scheme, the effect of which was to defraud Mr Gildare and the two Australian companies of their patent rights. Very clearly, something needs to be done. It is quite insufficient that one body shuffles the matter on to another body, which shuffles the matter on to another body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only body which has expressed some real interest to date in following the matter up is the Australian Federal Police, but the AFP cannot follow the matter up unless it gets a direction to do so. Therein lies the rub. The only people who are really interested in following this matter, in bringing Mr Rad and those involved in the fraud to justice, are prevented because they do not have the power. Those who do have the power display no interest in exercising their power for their good exercise of judgment. At that point, I seek leave for these documents as described to be tabled. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the decision makes no sense at all, except to those bureaucrats who justify every crazy political decision by claiming that their decisions are demanded by economic efficiency, necessary restructuring, commercial reality, or some other meaningless cliche. I believe their reality is real only because their framework excludes a whole host of social values and economic factors which, if included, would show their decision to be ideological gobbledegook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention some of the social values and economic factors which, I believe, seem to have been ignored. They include such questions as: what will happen to the 400-plus workers and their families when the workshops are closed down in 1996? What economic sense does it make to force over 400 workers onto the dole instead of being gainfully employed? What job prospects are there now for children and young people who are being educated in Townsville and for whom, for years, the railway workshops provided apprenticeships and other job prospects? What will happen to Townsville based businesses which currently trade with Townsville railway workshops and their employees? That trade is estimated at somewhere around $8.2 million per year. How will railway workers who are made redundant pay for school, medical and dental bills, repayments on the family home and other day-to-day family expenses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland transport minister, Mr Hamill, has stated that no-one will be sacked or forcibly relocated. Yet the workshops are to be shifted to Rockhampton, some 800 kilometres away. The workshop jobs in Townsville are to be reduced from 467 to a maximum of 35 at Stuart, and nearly all of the Townsville workers want to keep their jobs and stay in Townsville. Somebody cannot add up. I suspect it is Mr Hamill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read parts of a letter which is addressed to members of the Senate by a Mr Barry Simpson. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My name is Barry Simpson and I am a Union Delegate in the Townsville Railway Workshops and I have asked that this letter be read to the members of the senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the decision last year by the A.L.P. Government and the Board of Queensland Rail to close the Townsville Railway Workshops, which has a workforce of 4 hundred employees, and send all work to Rockhampton with the exception of minor repairs to be done at a One spot shop by only 28 staff, and some heritage, plus minor carriage repairs to be carried out by 30 staff in one of the existing workshops, we have been fighting the decision in an attempt to save our jobs and the workshops.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional development in Queensland is a joke why is Townsville rail work being sent to Rockhampton at the expense of Townsville rail workers and local businesses, even now work from North Queensland which has always been done in the Townsville workshops is being sent away to Rockhampton at the direction of Q.R. management, while leaving other business groups in Q.R. such as primary industry with a shortage of wagons for the cattle industry.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Federal Government about to release its white paper on employment what chances has a person in regional Queensland have of finding or retaining employment when you have a state Government like the A.L.P. in Queensland with such a bloody minded attitude towards its very own supporters or maybe once their supporters.</PARA>
<PARA>This decision also flies in the face of the need for regional development in North Queensland. I would like to read from the ACTU or Kelty paper on regional development and indicate some of the things it says about North Queensland. It is entitled `North Queensland is moving into the future with confidence'. Under the subheading `Opportunities&mdash;Transport' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opening up of the Carpentaria Mount Isa minerals province will make extensive use of Townsville's rail network and port facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued maintenance of Townsville's road and rail infrastructure will further develop not only Townsville, but also areas west, north and south.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is scope for fast road and rail links between Townsville and Cairns. This would open up two-way tourism and freight traffic between the two cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are indications that at least seasonally there is scope for substantial air freight from the region, primarily agricultural produce.</PARA>
<PARA>On another page the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered imperative that the Port of Townsville be upgraded. Deepening of the port to allow larger ships to enter would open up many opportunities for the export and tourism markets.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the reports are saying&mdash;and the plea is all about this&mdash;that the railway in North Queensland is an essential part of its growing transport infrastructure. In the face of that, it makes no sense to cut the heart out of the maintenance facilities for the railways section of that infrastructure. I can only hope that the federal government has more sense than the Queensland government and can bring pressure to bear to have this foolish decision reversed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 6.50 p.m., during the tabling of government documents, we had as the first item the review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training written by Professor Kenneth Wiltshire and submitted to the Australian government. The report was tabled in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a few minutes to speak about this report and mentioned that I had four criticisms, although I was wanting to commend, with some brief remarks, the bulk of the report. As my time allowed me to get through only the first two points of it, and the Senate having taken note of the report, I will take a few minutes in the adjournment debate to continue and complete my remarks. I wish to refer to recommendation 9. The board has recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to establish a task force to examine the linkages between the economy, employment, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely fundamental; and is seen by Professor Wiltshire as being so. My reservation is that this matter ought not go to just some ordinary task force but ought to be at the heart of what the board has as its mandate, its terms of reference, and one of the objectives it has to fulfil. If it can be better done by a major task force, by all means it should so be done. I want it to be a standing objective of the board and have all members of the board apply themselves to it in detail. Recommendation 9 also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to produce a conceptualisation within which linkages could be addressed and then move towards the objective of obtaining a clear understanding of the linkages and interfaces and their implications.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that. I urge that the danger of downgrading this important task to a small task force be avoided and that it be genuinely a full part of the board's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 18 includes the innovation of having an executive of the board. It is proposed that it have six members. I put the alternative suggestion that it have only four members, including the chair and the deputy chair. I believe that as a group of four, with a quorum of three, the purposes set out are even more likely to be achieved. One small matter I did not refer to when talking about recommendation 1 was point (f), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All advices and reports and references should be tabled within 30 sitting days after being received by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I put the lament that I have put for a number of years, that 30 sitting days often means more than three months. We received a report on 3 May that was given to the government in February 1994. I suggest that the time be less than 30 sitting days. Any of the well-developed reports of the board or the councils under the board&mdash;and there will be now six councils&mdash;will be sufficiently maturely put to be published virtually at the same time as being given to the minister. I will not lay that discipline on the government but I just say, `Please table them much more quickly than 30 sitting days.' I suggest something like five or 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These last few remarks, which are minor criticisms or alternative suggestions, pale in the light of my first and major criticism. I want NBEET to have integrity, independence, and a standing in the community of educational institutions around this country. It will be able to speak almost as an equal to the Commonwealth government, ministers of that government and senior members of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Despite what Professor Wiltshire has recommended in his otherwise good report, this is the time when the integrity of NBEET needs to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to see the secretariat of NBEET&mdash;recommendations 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67 all refer to the secretariat&mdash;fulfilling not only all those recommendations but having the resources to be a genuine and comprehensive secretariat for the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and the six councils. I agree with the particulars of the recommendations I have just cited, all of which go towards ensuring that there are professional staff separately allocated to each council with career paths, a sense of development and security, and the adequacy to serve the board and the councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this year we are seeing NBEET relying upon the Department of Employment, Education and Training to get staff in order to fulfil its objectives. I believe that more resources need to be given to NBEET to ensure the integrity and independence of NBEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer very briefly to a number of recommendations with which I agree. Recommendation 8 is that there be six councils, adding the Australian Language and Literature Council. This is the outcome of a Senate report on Australia's national language policy. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I were successive chairmen of that committee. The report eventually came out when you were chairman. I believe that it is still on track and that it is being implemented, not least by this council to be formed within NBEET. I will watch the work of that council very carefully. I agree with recommendation 61. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other new council is the Australian International Education Foundation, AIEF. I agree with the formation of that as a council within NBEET and for it to be reviewed after two years. Recommendation 13 is about the composition of the council. I agree with that composition. Recommendation 52 is a statement of confidence in the Australian Research Council. I, too, agree with that. Recommendation 57 is that there be a continuation of discipline studies&mdash;that is, faculties of law, medicine, humanities and so on all around Australia. I not only believe that it should be continued by ARC, but also that NBEET itself should ensure that more than a research emphasis be adopted in those discipline studies. Recommendation 72 is that the database of the department be available to NBEET. I fully agree; it is very important. I agree with recommendation 73, which is about evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction to the executive summary talks about intersectoral and international themes as being at the heart of this review. I also welcome those two words and what is meant by those two words in this report. Having called for this report for six years, I believe that it should be implemented, but implemented even more so with my humble suggestions to the Senate and to the Australian government. </PARA>

A case management plan was developed in accordance with the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to fully rehabilitate Ms Clement back into the workplace. Ms Clement initially agreed to, but subsequently rejected, the Comcare approved rehabilitation provider. The case management plan was closed with Comcare's concurrence and the ABS asked Comcare to review Ms Clement's case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The staff attitude survey in the ISC in 1993 was conducted by Towers Perrin, Canberra. The purpose of the Staff Attitude Survey is to enhance the performance of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the job satisfaction of staff by listening to and acting upon staff views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) $22,300 including questionnaire design, printing, data entry, analysis and reporting.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The survey asked 98 questions of staff and the results show the percentage response favourable, neutral and unfavourable in each of these items. The 1993 results were compared with the results of a smaller staff survey in 1992 and showed more positive staff attitudes on almost all indicators including communication, empowerment, teamwork and cooperation, commitment and satisfaction, performance reward alignment, satisfaction with pay, quality orientation and external focus, and supervisor support. In most areas, the ISC compares favourably with public service averages, with relative strengths in supervisor support, empowerment, quality orientation and external focus. Staff perceptions about training and leadership are virtually unchanged from 1992 to 1993 and are lower than public service averages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main report has been made available to all managers in the ISC and the summary report has been made available to all staff. The main report notes that the ISC has already put in place many programs to improve human resource management and development and that this trend should continue. Recommendations focus on improving the ISC's performance in areas where the perceptions of staff are relatively less positive. They address management issues, especially managing people, perceptions about EEO and safety, technology and  training. Action on the recommendations is continuing to receive consideration by the ISC and most work areas are locally addressing the issues raised by the survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) It was anticipated that staff would spend 20 minutes filling out the survey. Total time spent on the survey by staff was approximately 102 hours or 14 person-days.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Commission has provided the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. This project commenced when, in June 1992, the Department of Employment, Education and Training contracted the Australian Local Government Training Board to initiate an elected member training program for Aboriginal elected members and potential elected members in the Northern Territory. Following the Government decision to transfer the community training elements of the Training for Aboriginals Program to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the project, which was supported by the Commission, was transferred in July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission accepted the Department of Employment Education and Training commitment of $479,500 in the transfer of the project. The grant was initially approved in the expectation that the project would be completed in one year; concluding 30 June 1993. The project was the subject of two major changes. These changes primarily concerned an initial expansion of the round of community consultations followed by community rather than regional based delivery. The changes resulted in the extension of the project to June 1994 but not an increase in the overall level of funding. Two payments, totalling $239,750 were made in the 1992/93 financial year and to date one payment of $119,875 has been made this financial year. A further final payment is due after the receipt of a detailed acquittal of past grants to the Australian Local Government Training Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) None. Twenty five days of on site consultation with thirty eight communities were held in the financial year 1992/93. The prime outcome of the consultations was a realisation that communities felt they would learn more from the formal training if it was based upon community visits by the trainer. Such training commenced in the second half of 1993; (25 communities with 241 participants).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. David Menzel &amp; Associates, Local Government, Rural and Tourism Consultants undertook an evaluation. An interim report was addressed by a Monitoring Committee comprising representatives of the ATSIC representative and administrative arms, Department of Employment Education and Training, NT State Government, Local Government organisations and the Australian Services Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Project Consultant, Mr David Clifton, has also prepared reports on the delivery of the project. The Monitoring Committee then recommended the second major change referred to in point (2). That change required a delivery phase based upon individual community needs rather than the series of three day workshops in regional centres originally proposed. The first change had involved an expansion of the community consultation phase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No additional funds were either requested from or provided by ATSIC for this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Additional funds were not made available. The Monitoring Committee has formally met on ten occasions to discuss the project and the training being provided through the project. The Local Government Training Board(NT) was sub-contracted by the Australian Local Government Training Board to implement the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Approximately 18% of the total cost of the project was allocated for project management for a one year project; financial year 1992/93. This increased to about 24% in a budget supplied by the Australian Local Government Training Board dated July 1993, after the Monitoring Committee recommended a second six month extension of the project. The increase in project management was not unexpected given that the project had, with the assistance of the Monitoring Committee, to go through a refinement phase. During this phase budget changes became necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. It should be noted that when the Australian Local Government Training Board, (formerly Council), sought and obtained the third release of funds from ATSIC, it forwarded a Board's audit report dated 21/9/93. In this the auditor stated that the "financial report presents fairly the financial position of the Council as at 30 June 1993 and the results of the Council for the year then ended in accordance with Statements of Accounting Concepts, applicable Accounting Standards and the requirement of the Council's constitution."  On the basis of that information the third release of $119,875 was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC subsequently obtained from the ALGTB another document prepared by the same auditor, dated 10/9/93, which had not been previously supplied. This document is described as a management request, not an audit report. It expressed concern with the Board's accounting procedures. Specifically, problems with the identification of direct costs attributable to particular projects. The auditor also confirmed the need for additional operational funding for the ALGTB. A detailed acquittal of the funds released to date is being sought by ATSIC from the ALGTB prior to the final release being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) As already mentioned the developmental nature of this project has meant that the expenditure items within the overall budget have changed over time. The Monitoring Committee was aware that it was to endorse the project as it was developed and implemented.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ABC Chair wrote to the former Minister on 16 December 1993 requesting that he approach the Treasurer with a view to his directing the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), under section 29(1)(a) of the Trade Practices Act, to give special consideration to perceived public interest aspects in considering the ABC application. When considering this matter, the Government was mindful that the Parliament, in passing amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide for Pay TV, agreed to specific provisions making all Pay TV activities subject to the Trade Practices Act. Services under Licence C are required to be undertaken on a fully commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ABC holds the view that, because news, children's, documentary and arts and entertainment services proposed under Licence C, as in all other major markets, are typically provided in the delivery of subscription services as an integrated component in the basic package of core services, the TPC would accept the commercial and public interest arguments advanced in the course of the ABC's application and subsequent submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event, the ABC subsequently withdrew its application to the TPC following release by the Commission of a draft determination.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government has been concerned for some time about the displacement of civilians as a result of the long-running civil war in Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 the Nuba Mountains region has been subject to conflict between Government forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, resulting in insecurity, destruction of ethnic identity and forced re-location of peoples. Human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings, summary executions and suppression of religious freedom are now commonplace. There is evidence that, since 1992, a Jihad or holy war has been declared against non-Muslims, especially Christians, in the Nuba Mountains, and has since become part of daily life in zones of armed conflict there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that a mass displacement of people has occurred in the Nuba Mountains in Kordofan state. According to the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Sudan, Gaspar Biro, serious human rights violations have occurred on a particularly large scale in the Nuba Mountains, where the Sudanese Government tolerates the policy pursued by local authorities of depopulating the area in their efforts to quell the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of Sudan is also pursuing a widespread process of Islamicisation in the Ingessini Hills, in the southern Blue Nile province, involving compulsory military service in the Popular Defence Force, an arm of the Sudanese Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The destructive effects of civil war in southern Sudan have led to dislocation on a massive scale. Hundreds of thousands of severely malnourished civilians have been forced into continuing dependence on emergency assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is particularly concerned at the continuing military offensive in southern Sudan by the Sudanese Government, which began in December 1993. This offensive includes indiscriminate high altitude bombing raids by the Sudanese Government against civilian targets along Sudan's borders with Uganda and Kenya. These have now forced up to two hundred thousand civilians in the provinces of Eastern and Western Equatoria to flee to Uganda and Kenya. The Australian Government is particularly appalled that some of the bombing has been directed near camps for the displaced, including the "triple-A" camps of Aswa, Atepe and Ame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the renewed fighting, the Australian Ambassador in Cairo, who is accredited to Sudan, has been instructed to make high level representations in Khartoum urging the Government of Sudan to end the military offensive in the south, and to commit itself to participate in the peace process brokered by neighbouring states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Access by international non-governmental organisations or independent observers to many areas of the Nuba Mountains has been severely or completely restricted for many years, which means that accurate assessment of the numbers of deaths and the numbers of displaced is correspondingly difficult. Some examples, from the interim report of the UN special rapporteur, however, illustrate the trend. In southern Kordofan, in the districts of Dilling, Kadugli, Salam and Rashad, there were up to 91 displaced persons camps ("peace villages"), with a total population of 167,265 by late 1993. The nearby Wali tribe of 29,000 has now been completely displaced, some 9,000 being in resettlement camps, the rest being dispersed throughout the state.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Government has already undertaken research into available sources about the circumstances of the Hilton bombing and the allegations concerning the role of Commonwealth agencies. It has found no evidence to suggest that any Commonwealth agency acted improperly. Any outstanding allegations concerning the Hilton bombing relate to matters which were, and remain, the responsibility of the New South Wales authorities and the New South Wales Government. On that basis, and on the information which is currently available, there is no justification for the application of Commonwealth resources to an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I advised the House of Representatives in response to a question without notice on 10 February 1994, the position with respect to the war crimes investigations and prosecutions was different. The Commonwealth had received clear evidence, following on from the Menzies review of material relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia, that there were a number of cases requiring further action. It was the Commonwealth's decision that such evidence could not be ignored and that further investigation was required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has consistently stated that if the New South Wales Government wishes to establish a State inquiry into the Hilton bombing, then the Commonwealth will cooperate fully. This point has been made in correspondence to the New South Wales Attorney-General, and in response to questions raised in the House of Representatives. The Commonwealth's willingness to cooperate with such an inquiry has already been demonstrated. Indeed, I am advised that the Commonwealth assisted an earlier State-initiated inquiry relating to this matter, namely the 1984 inquiry conducted under section 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) by Mr Justice Wood. Obviously, this Government has no conceivable interest in frustrating an inquiry into the events of 1978.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) While Albanian authorities could justifiably be accused of some heavy-handedness in their treatment of ethnic Greeks in southern Albania, the Albanian Government has recently introduced human rights legislation and seems committed to fair treatment for all its citizens. During his visit to Albania late last year the Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias raised the issue of more equitable treatment for Albania's Greek minority. As a result of the visit, the Albanian government pledged legislation to enable the Greek language to be taught throughout Albania. The visit has raised hopes for a more constructive bilateral relationship in the future. Further, in 1993 the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Commissioner for Minorities, Max van der Stoel, visited Albania to investigate claims of discrimination against the Greek community. Van der Stoel's report said Albania's commitment to providing full CSCE rights to ethnic Greeks was real and that the ethnic Greek community does in fact enjoy those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) During a visit to Albania in February 1994, Australia's Ambassador to Albania and Italy clearly registered Australia's human rights concerns in meetings with President Berisha, Deputy Prime Minister Kopliku and Foreign Minister Serreqi. Such concerns were raised in a general context and did not specify the issue of Albania's treatment of its Greek minority. Particularly in discussions with Mr Kopliku, the Ambassador explained Australia's policy of global concern for human rights and our strong hope that the political evolution in Albania would respect all democratic norms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) President Berisha, during his meeting with Australia's Ambassador in February 1994, said that the relationship between Albania and Greece was no longer in a state of crisis. The visit in late 1993 by Foreign Minister Papoulias seems to have helped mend relations. Although incidents of human rights abuse undoubtedly still occur, including against ethnic Greeks, Albania has made enormous progress towards instituting democratic and human rights norms. This progress is even more commendable considering the four and a half decades of repressive dictatorship Albania endured prior to 1990. Albania now welcomes foreigners to observe or monitor its adherence to international human rights principles.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Neither the Republic of Korea nor the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were signatories to the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco. Korea was not a combatant against Japan during World War II and was not party to the said treaty. Relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan were normalised in 1965. At that time the Japanese Government made a financial contribution of approximately US$500 million to the Republic of Korea, although the Japanese Government has never formally agreed that this payment was for reparations. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan have still not normalised relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Government's position, based on legal advice available to it, is that the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 represented a legitimate and final solution to the issue of claims for reparations arising from Japan's actions during World War II. In particular, under Article 14(b) of the Treaty, the Allied Powers waived all further reparations claims by the Allied Powers and their nationals against Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government has welcomed the recent statements by the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Hosokawa, that Japan needs to face up to its wartime actions. Acknowledgment of and atonement for these past actions will enhance acceptance of Japan's role in the East Asian region. While Prime Minister Hosokawa's statements of regret are considerably more forthcoming than those made by previous Japanese governments, further reparations for victims of Japanese war-time actions have been ruled out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal position outlined under (2) above does not provide the Australian Government or other signatories to the San Francisco Treaty with a legal basis to pursue the reparations issue. So far as the Australian Government is aware, the issue of compensation for Asian `comfort' women has not been raised in the Commission on Human Rights and hence the question of Australian Government support for any action there has not arisen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The objective of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program is to improve the dental health of financially disadvantaged people in Australia. While the Government would like to see a general improvement in access to all dental services for Health Card holders, the available funding had to be targeted necessarily to the area of perceived greatest need and most productive outcome. The Program therefore focuses on restorative and preventive services with the aim, wherever possible, of avoiding unnecessary extractions of teeth.</PARA>

Delivery of services under the Program to nursing home and hostel residents will be an extension of current arrangements for services under State and Territory Programs. As with denture services and other dental care for residents of nursing homes and hostels, delivery of Commonwealth Program services will vary between jurisdictions, but generally will be delivered through a combination of domiciliary dental units, on site dental clinics, dental practitioners visiting homes and hostels, and transport assistance for clients to attend a local clinic or a major dental hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government has not specifically commissioned research into the demand for dental services by residents of nursing homes or hostels. The National Health and Medical Research Council has, however, provided funding of $10,000 to researchers at the University of New England for a project entitled "Strategies to improve equity in oral health care for the rural aged". The purpose of the research is to investigate access to dental care for aged people living in rural areas, including those residing at home or in nursing homes. The results of this study are not yet available.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The International Visitor Survey (IVS) is designed to provide a profile of the characteristics, travel behaviour and expenditure of international visitors to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The figure of $686 100 is the contract price for the conduct of the core 1994 IVS. Additional costs are also incurred in commissioning and managing the survey, and for supplementary surveys. These supplementary surveys involve adding questions to the core IVS or asking questions of additional numbers of visitors, and are funded entirely by the government agency or business group commissioning the  supplementary survey. For 1994 the cost of supplementary surveys totals $38 000 to date. Commissioning costs for the 1994 survey were $7 887.80, covering the contract period from 1994 to 1996. Staffing and overhead costs in the Bureau of Tourism Research associated with managing the survey are estimated at approximately $30 000 for 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The contract price for the core 1992 IVS was $727 145. This was also the contract price for the core 1993 IVS. Supplementary surveys and special output tabulations totalling $61 558 were commissioned from the survey contractor in 1992, and supplementary surveys totalling $161 350 were commissioned in 1993. These additional costs were fully recovered from the government and industry bodies that initiated the work. In addition, there were staffing and overhead costs in the Bureau of Tourism Research associated with managing the survey, estimated at approximately $30 000 in each year. There were no direct commissioning costs incurred for the 1992 or 1993 surveys, as the contract period commenced in 1990.</PARA>

For major source countries and regions, a specified minimum number of visitors is surveyed throughout the year. The criterion for a specific minimum number of interviews is that a country or region supplies more than 1.5 per cent of international visitors to Australia. This guarantees that sample sizes from these countries and regions will be sufficiently large to allow detailed analysis of travel patterns and expenditures.

The ABA has a mandatory obligation to investigate narrowcast operators when it has received a complaint concerning an offence against the Act or the Regulations, or, concerning a breach of a class licence condition. The ABA is not required to investigate the business practices of narrowcasters.</PARA>

However, in general, where a government party proposes to do a "permissible future act" over land where native title has been determined or which is under claim for native title, the Native Title Act 1993 provides that registered native title holders and registered native title claimants will have a right to negotiate before such an act can be taken.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Average bank net interest margins (defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets) on the domestic business of most of the major Australian banks have increased slightly in 1992-93 over their levels in the preceding financial year. This reflects, inter alia, a reduction in banks' non-performing loans and improvements in the capital base of the banks (both of which increase banks' net interest earnings), and, as such, is consistent with the economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government welcomes the Code of Banking Practice and regards it as a major step forward in banker-customer relations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Code is voluntary, for those institutions who agree to be bound by it, the relevant provisions will be contractually enforceable. The Government is assured that all member banks of the ABA that offer retail financial services will endeavour to achieve full compliance with the Code over the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monitoring of the Code will be conducted by the Australian Payments System Council whose membership includes industry, government and consumer representatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various recommendations of the Martin and Elliott Committees favoured the development of a comparative interest rate and the disclosure of bank charges and margins.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government has budgeted to provide seed funding of $300,000 to help establish a privately operated comparative financial information centre. The centre will provide consumers with ready access to information enabling them to compare, on any one day, credit card and other products offered by different financial institutions. Officials are currently undertaking the necessary processes whereby interested parties may tender to establish and operate such a service. While the centre's initial emphasis will be on consumer credit products (credit cards), it is expected that its focus will expand to provide a full range of financial information to enable consumers to select the institution that, at the time of inquiry, provides the deposit and/or credit products most suited to their individual requirements.</PARA>
