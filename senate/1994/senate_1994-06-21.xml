<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to expectations expressed today by respected economists that, as a result of the government's lax fiscal policy, interest rates are expected to rise by at least one per cent in the near future. Does the minister appreciate that this will add $864 a year to the average home loan? When will the government come clean and acknowledge that a failure of its policies will result in interest rate rises and that new home buyers and small businesses should be factoring this into domestic budgets and business plans?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the substantive matters in issue, I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday which, in essence, was that at some stage of the recovery interest rates will need to rise to ensure that inflation remains low. Official interest rates have fallen to their lowest level since the 1970s and we have to expect that there will be an increase in rates at some stage of the recovery. But interest rates will not rise in the near term because inflation in Australia is at historically low levels and is among the lowest in the Western world. That is the truth of the matter. Those are the fundamentals of the Australian economy, and there is no rational basis for any interest rates rise in the near term given that particular inflationary environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of fiscal responsibility generally, we do not need to be lectured by the likes of Senator Hill and the opposition on this particular matter. Our responsibility has been to identify a path of fiscal management by this country which will return to budget in approximate balance within a few short years, 1996-97. That has been universally acknowledged to be a totally responsible approach to be adopted by the government and it is one that is, in fact, perfectly capable of achievement in a way that will produce a sustained low inflation but, at the same time, high growth environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast is quite spectacular between the responsible approach that has been adopted by the government and the conspicuously, vulgarly, populist, opportunistic approach that has been adopted by members of the opposition on this as on every other matter. They sing with different tunes and different songs. Mr Costello says he wants a balanced budget; Mr Downer, of course, wants to spend money on everything under the sun that will appeal to this or that interest group as he systematically works his way around hawking his body to this or that interest group in an attempt to get away from the desiccated imagery of his predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has not persuaded anybody so far; he will not in the future because there is no substance or integrity in the opposition's policy. Those opposite might have changed their leadership, they might have changed their front bench, but there is an iron law of arithmetic that applies in this sort of situation; that is, nothing plus or minus nothing still equals nothing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is it not the real case, as Mr Mark Hopkinson, the head of financial markets in Schroeders, said this morning, that the political stakes are pretty high in this exercise? Is it not the real fact that the government is concentrating on the internal political consequences rather than giving Australian business and home buyers a real appreciation of what is to logically follow from its fiscal failures? Does the minister not recognise that yesterday bond yields soared to their highest levels since April 1992 and short-term interest rates rose sharply? Does this not logically mean that in the relatively near future there will be a substantial lift in interest rates, speculated today to be at least one per cent? The government should be advising home buyers and small business to be taking this into account.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made perfectly clear that, the way this system operates, we cannot work on the assumption that movements of this kind can be resisted in perpetuity. It is the case that at some stage of the recovery cycle we do have to anticipate some rise in interest rates. But there is no ground for anticipating such a rise in the near term when the fundamentals remain as solid as they are. If the opposition had any responsibility at all in this respect, it would be trying to get some sanity and balance back into the bond market, not talking up the irrationality that is conspicuously there at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no fundamental reasons in the Australian market. There is a bit of volatility that is generated by the situation in the United States and overseas. But, if we look at the fundamentals of the Australian market&mdash;the underlying inflation rate and the reasonable expectations this economy has for the future&mdash;there is simply no foundation for the behaviour of the markets in this respect at the moment. For the opposition to talk up the degree of irrationality that is prevailing at the moment is to perform no service at all to home owners, home buyers or anyone else.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new funding arrangements, management of the scheme will be transferred to a joint board comprising 11 local councils, where it will be jointly administered with other tree planting schemes currently operating in that region. This scheme will also be incorporated as a community based employment company. A consultant will be engaged to develop a business plan which will enable the company to take advantage of REEP and a range of other labour market programs. The plan will also develop a range of opportunities to attract funds from private enterprise and local government. Federal funding for the scheme will cease at the end of the 1995-96 financial year, after which time we certainly hope and believe that this scheme will be on a self-sustained footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wet tropics tree planting scheme, despite all the best efforts of the opposition, has been a popular and successful initiative of this government. Its restructuring offers great potential for a cooperative approach towards meeting environmental, labour market, and industry development objectives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Defence, relates to aircraft noise in Darwin and follows a question asked by Senator Jones on 4 May. In answer to Senator Jones's question, the minister indicated that he had asked the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Les Fisher, to visit Darwin to investigate the issue of military aircraft noise in that city.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed in the Senate last month, the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Fisher, visited Darwin from 10 to 13 May to undertake a full investigation into aircraft noise in Darwin. His brief included allegations that visiting pilots were straying from their designated flight paths and agreed procedures. As part of that investigation, a wide range of Darwin people were interviewed, including community leaders, business leaders, residents and other interest groups. I will summarise the major findings of the investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no evidence that the United States marine corps pilots strayed from flight plans. There was evidence of one marine corps pilot not complying with an air traffic direction. The pilot misunderstood the requirements and was counselled by the marine corps authorities to prevent a recurrence. There was evidence that noise abatement procedures were breached. However, the noise abatement procedures promulgated by the Royal Australian Air Force lacked clarity and could be misunderstood, especially by foreigners. In addition, they were not fully effective in reducing military jet noise to reasonable levels. No arrangements were in place to ensure that all pilots had received and understood the procedures. Lastly, the public relations effort for exercises by foreign services operating from Darwin has not been effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now had an opportunity to consider Air Vice Marshal Fisher's report and its conclusions. I have agreed to a number of sensible changes to existing procedures which will minimise aircraft noise. Revised noise abatement procedures will be put in place which more closely reflect the suburban disposition of Darwin and the concern of residents. They will require military fast jet aircraft to conduct straight-in approaches by day and night, except during major defence exercises such as Pitch Black and Kangaroo. Arrangements will be put into place to ensure that all pilots comply with the revised noise abatement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional resources will be provided to control and monitor foreign force activities. A much greater effort will be made to ensure that the Darwin community is kept fully informed of why, when and for how long foreign military aircraft will be operating from Darwin and of the efforts being made to minimise noise. With regard to the last part of the honourable senator's question, I can advise the Senate that Air Vice Marshal Fisher's report will be tabled in the Senate tomorrow.</PARA>

Will the minister release details of the role played by the Australian chair of the IAEA's board of governors in the North Korean stand-off? Did Australia's position on the IAEA require the Australian government to agree to UN sanctions against North Korea even at the risk of war on the peninsula?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of UN sanctions in relation to North Korea remains hypothetical at this stage. Hopefully, in the light of the recent developments that I talked about yesterday, it will not be necessary to go down that particular path. But, if UN sanctions ever are applied in this situation, Australia has an obligation as a UN member to support those sanctions. It would be quite unthinkable for us to do otherwise. In the event that mandatory measures are adopted by the Security Council, Australia, like every other member of the UN, would be bound to implement them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for the UN in these respects has been a longstanding pillar of Australian foreign policy and there is absolutely no need in that context to have any formalised approval procedures as new situations evolve.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as our role in relation to the International Atomic Energy Agency is concerned, we played the very responsible role that one would expect us to be playing as a longstanding member in good standing of that particular organisation and as chairman of it during the recent troubled period. We are a country with a very strong commitment to the IAEA and to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We do take the view that it is appalling for any country to walk away from its obligations under that particular treaty and we will always, as a result, be among those willing to apply appropriate measures in situations where countries do not discharge their obligations formally and solemnly entered into. That, regrettably, was the situation so far as North Korea was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts was impliedly asking me about the situation in relation to Japan and other countries that might be closer perhaps to possessing nuclear weapons. I just say, in anticipation of that, that in the case of Japan it is a country with very good standing as a member of the non-proliferation treaty and the Atomic Energy Agency. It is not a matter of Australia ignoring anything in relation to Japan's nuclear conduct in this respect. We have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that the only nuclear activity in which Japan has been engaged, or is likely to be engaged, is in relation to peaceful purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of other countries that may have nuclear weapons possession potential&mdash;Israel, India, Pakistan are those that are most commonly mentioned in this respect&mdash;the situation is that, regrettably, they are quite outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. They are not parties to any of these international obligations and, as such, there is no basis on which the international community can effectively respond to any new development. That is a situation we would very much like to change and have been working actively diplomatically for a very long time to try to change, not least in the context of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference which comes up next year.</PARA>

At the same time, of course, in a very delicate situation of this kind where we are trying to take into account not only the effect of past actions but possible future actions, it does make sense to try, so far as humanly possible, not to make the situation any worse and to go down the path of a rational and negotiated solution.

The services supplied in surgery are well known to a number of Australians and internationally as being of world leading quality. Of course, there is significant aged care expertise, amongst others, which could be referred to. Australia offers higher clinical standards at rates which are competitive in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government commissioned a major study on services exports generally. The study suggests that health export revenues have the potential to increase by an average of 25 per cent over the next five years from roughly $30 million last year. It appears on the basis of that survey and other evidence that Australia is well placed to take advantage of developing markets for health products and services in the Middle East and Asia&mdash;a product of the changing living standards in those areas and the burgeoning middle class in that region. The government is actively encouraging the health industry to form strategic alliances to increase exports and promote the internationalisation of Australian health suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, for example, through the Melbourne-based Australian medical and services export group, which represents, as I understand it, about 25 companies, a very interesting example of the success of this type of cooperation. The group is expecting sales worth $18 million to $20 million to Thailand over the next year for equipment and services. There are other significant strategic alliances in scientific research and R&amp;D generally which have the potential to generate significant revenue for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly significant area of the market relates to Japan's rapidly increasing population of elderly people. There are opportunities there for the provision of health services and aged care. The special trade representative John Button, who is well known to Senator Cooney, led a health mission to Japan as recently as November of last year. As a result, several initiatives were developed to enable Australian health providers to capture opportunities in this market, and I think most Australians would welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April I discovered that there is significant potential in the Middle East for Australian-Saudi joint ventures to improve the Saudi health system at significant potential profit to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for her question and her continuing interest in rural issues. It is correct that the levies are used to fund the organisations that Senator West has named. I am pleased to announce reductions in those levy rates to the Senate. The new rates will apply from July of this year. The rates will see the cattle transaction levy fall from $4 to $3.60. The slaughter levy on sheep will fall from 55.8c to 47.7c per head, and on lambs it will fall from 105.8c to 89.7c. These reductions in the levies will provide producers with an additional $16 million in their pockets, which I am sure the industry will welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reductions reflect the fact that levy collections in recent years have been higher than expected because of the level of sales and the important decisions that have been taken by two of the corporations to reduce the level of  reserves that are being held by them. The government has also been able to reduce the national residue survey component of the levy for sheep and lambs by improved efficiency in the delivery of that program. In addition, the government has agreed to a request from the Cattle Council of Australia for an additional 8c levy component of the transaction levy to be paid directly into the NRS trust fund. This will ensure product quality for the cattle industry through targeted residue testing and producer education. I congratulate the cattle industry on taking this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability to meet consumer demand for clean food will play a large part in determining the future prosperity of the industry in Australia. The reductions in the levy rates confirm a downward trend in livestock industry levy rates. Prior to December 1991, the cattle transaction levy was as high as $6.25.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Reynolds this day, relating to a tree planting scheme in the Queensland wet tropics heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA>The new Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, has made a fool of himself since he first took on this portfolio. He has had a lot of catching up to do, but he has not done it very successfully. His inauspicious start was when he was asked about a sensitive environmental, political question in North Queensland. He told the media that he could not stop to answer it because he had a plane waiting for him and he could not face the media. It turned out, as the media reported with great merriment, that the plane Senator Faulkner was waiting to catch was a VIP plane which went when he wanted it to. He became the laughing stock of the media in North Queensland on that beginning, and he has not recovered since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is now having great difficulty with the Oyster Point-Port Hinchinbrook proposal&mdash;a proposal that has been approved by the Queensland state Labor government and one which the state Labor government is encouraging to go ahead, subject to stringent environmental conditions which have been imposed. Senator Faulkner is now being captured by the radical left wing greenie movement to try to stop it. He does not understand that it is a major development for North Queensland&mdash;one which will create a huge number of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner is also in trouble over the skyrail project in Cairns&mdash;a project which his department has approved. It is now being targeted by the radical greenie movement. People are coming up from Byron Bay and elsewhere&mdash;most of whom are drawing unemployment benefits&mdash;to deliberately interfere with the construction of that project, even though it has been approved by both the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government. The proposal by some of these radical green movement people is to interfere with helicopter safety, to sit in trees, to obstruct machinery, and to do whatever they can to stop this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner's other difficulties in the north include his government's stopping funding for the tree planting project. I am pleased to say that, no doubt as a result of my raising this matter a couple of weeks ago in the Senate, Senator Faulkner has had another look at this project and has realised that some money should be given to it and that it should go ahead. I am pleased that Senator Faulkner has had a change of heart on that proposal. I say to Senator Faulkner that, as is the case with most things relating to the wet tropics world heritage area, the Labor government has simply messed up the management of these projects that are intended to try to help with employment&mdash;the employment that the Labor government destroyed because of its insensitive management of the wet tropics world heritage listing of the rainforest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying principle behind Senator Faulkner's providing money for this tree planting scheme is to create jobs. But has he listened to those people who have told him that the way this project has been managed has in fact cost jobs? The giving away of these trees willy-nilly&mdash;many would say to friends of certain people in the business up there, friends of certain government officials&mdash;has meant that private nurseries which used to make a living out of selling trees have simply gone out of business. So some jobs are created with government money but, at the same time, as a result, the government put people out of work, closed businesses down and created bankruptcies. That is typical of the way the Labor government has acted throughout the whole sorry saga of the management of the wet tropics world heritage listing. While money is given for this tree planting scheme, and I am pleased to see that happening, it is in fact costing jobs and costing businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government should do is use that money to support private businesses. My understanding is that the government would get twice as many trees for the same cost if it went through private businesses. As well, the government would create the same number of jobs but would get twice the number of trees to plant. It seems to make sense that it should be done in the right way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The question asked by Senator Troeth was excellent. The problem is that the answer given was an absolute disgrace. Firstly, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) told the Australian people that we should not believe what a minister of the Crown said but that we should somehow interpret what he meant to say. Clearly, that is not a good enough standard for a person who seeks to draw the salary and/or the accompaniments of being a minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the answer was nothing short of a wholesale humiliation of the minister by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, because the Leader of the Government in the Senate told the Australian people what the minister actually meant. The minister was not saying, `Look, I accidentally said this but I meant to say something else.' Senator Evans was putting words into the minister's mouth. That is very embarrassing from the government's point of view and this needs to be highlighted to the Australian people. The comments of Gary Johns follow on from comments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Colston)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! Use the proper terms of address. `Mr Johns', please. </PARA>

We have a government in disarray, ministers going off all over the place and the Leader of the Government in the Senate trying to put it all back together again and telling us what they actually meant to say. That is not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made about Senator Evans's answer is that he has an absolutely condescending and patronising attitude towards mainstream Australia. He said that we have to tolerate these groups. Which groups? Women, who make up a majority of the Australian population, migrants and blacks. There are not many people left in the Australian community when we start knocking out all those groups which, supposedly, we have to tolerate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During question time I got one of the attendants to provide me with a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>. What does `tolerate' mean? It means to put up with, to endure or sustain as pain or hardship. So Senator Evans is saying that the Labor Party will put up with, and will endure or sustain the pain or hardship caused by women, blacks and migrants in the community. The government asserts that it is concerned about social justice, fairness and equity yet it uses such condescending and patronising language to mainstream Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only person in the Labor Party who seems to want to treat migrants, at least, as equals is Senator Carr. He is busily signing them up to the Labor Party to assist in stacking the branches in Victoria. It may well be that Senator Carr also tolerates them and puts up with the pain simply to get the gain of stacking branches. It would appear that the attitude of the Leader of the Government in the Senate from his language today is that he will tolerate these groups, and that is nothing short of a disgrace. Senator Troeth's question was a fair and proper question. It shows that she has a commitment to true equality and social justice. Senator Evans today has shown the people of Australia how condescending, patronising and two-faced the Labor Party is to mainstream Australians, namely, women, blacks and migrants. To marginalise them as this minister has is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

He was found to be heavily involved in the financial disgrace&mdash;the $3 billion loss by the State Bank in South Australia&mdash;which has bankrupted South Australia, put our economy behind the eight ball, and has now created the need for the present new state Liberal government to try to retrieve that situation and put South Australia back on the road to prosperity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The document tabled today entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National action plan: Australia</EMPHASIS> and accompanying comments by Senator Gareth Evans QC was initiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and presented on 22 February 1994 to the 50th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. It is an insult to this parliament that it has only now surfaced and been tabled in this place. My colleague Senator Rod Kemp has highlighted this matter and I think it is only as a result of his actions and his reservations that we now see it being presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the detail of the report, we see that it is a document that ought to demand the attention of each and every parliamentarian. Just about every area of government activity is now subjected to, in one form or another, a national action plan that is subservient to United Nations issues and proposals that flow from an international agenda that has been put forward. Of course, this is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlighted last night in the adjournment debate that the government had failed to table a north Australia social justice strategy which was distributed last week by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe. That report&mdash;and I refer people to the adjournment debate last night&mdash;went into a whole range of issues, in fact more than 240, that were specifically addressed with regard to disadvantage and Labor's social justice priorities on north Australia. That hidden report also highlighted over 170 specific strategies for social justice in north Australia. If we then turn to the national action plan for human rights, which has now been tabled, we find that a whole number of the issues are totally confusing and inconsistent. It is important that these should be drawn to everyone's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the areas that specifically affect me in my shadow ministry portfolio of housing, on page 33 of today's report there is an entire listing of a proposed national action plan for housing. This in turn has to be tested against the government's budget priorities and housing issues that have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the north Australian social justice strategy, which I drew to the attention of honourable senators last night, on page 69 of today's report there is an entire section on protecting the rights of rural and isolated people. We find that on page 70 of the proposed national action plan there are only three sentences that address the issues of the rights of rural and isolated people. I refer to the issue that was raised last night in the social justice plan where pages and pages and over 170 strategies were highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the area in today's report that lists the issues that relate to protecting the rights of indigenous people. This again needs to be drawn into the other document that was tabled by me, not by the government, last night. On pages 40 and 41 of today's report there is a list of issues relating to indigenous rights. Naturally the government is crowing about the issues relating to the Native Title Bill and the initiatives that it has put through recently with regard to ATSIC. But there is also the commitment to Aboriginal self-determination, and tucked away is a statement of commitment that subjugates this government to issues relating to the United Nations that are totally inconsistent with other plans and proposals that it is putting forward. </PARA>

As my colleague Senator Tambling said, it was tabled in Geneva in February. Now, four months later, it has been tabled in this parliament only because it was drawn to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, at the last estimates hearings on 24 May that this report had not been tabled in the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this document demonstrates in so many ways that Senator Evans and his colleagues are obsessed with these UN conventions and that they desire to incorporate the UN system more and more into our legal system. Senator Evans is very proud of the fact that ours was the first country to table a national action plan as requested. Senator Evans wants this document to be a model for all other countries. This self-promotion of Senator Evans at the UN is becoming a habit. We certainly hope that it has nothing to do with his career plans for when he leaves this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the parliament's attention to specific issues on pages 6 and 7 of this document, which deal with the attitude of this government to opening up appeals and complaints to UN committees, thereby incorporating UN committees into our legal system. Yesterday in the Senate I tabled the names of the people on the three committees that the Hawke and Keating governments have decided should play a role in our domestic disputes. As noted yesterday, many of the members of those committees are nominated by governments which simply do not practise human rights as we understand them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the sovereignty of a nation and about being proud to be Australian, one of the things we would not do is overturn the philosophy of the Australia Act and involve United Nations committees in Australian domestic law and constitutional law. We would not do it because we believe in the philosophy of the Australia Act; it is appropriate for domestic issues to be treated in our domestic courts and in our parliaments and for laws to be ruled on by known judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no need to take the decision to involve the United Nations in our domestic activities. As distinct from Senator Evans, Senator Schacht has been quite honest about the effect of this. Senator Schacht was the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it produced a report that looked at the issue of human rights around the world. That report recognised the fact that UN conventions and treaties have the capacity to limit the sovereignty of nations. Senator Schacht was quite clear about that, and I have no particular argument with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the republican Mr Keating and the republican Senator Evans have raised the issue of the independence and sovereignty of our country. The natural question is: why on earth has a decision been taken to involve these UN committees in our domestic activities? This parliament was never asked whether they should be involved; no law was ever passed in this parliament to permit it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that an increasing number of cases will now go offshore to be ruled on by these committees in Geneva. That is a big problem for Australia and a problem that will grow in the years to come because these committees will make rulings that do not have the support of any significant section of the Australian community except for the group that feels it has a particular problem. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hang on. Senator Kemp made a very impassioned speech accusing the government of wanting to change the constitution in all sorts of ways&mdash;of tearing it up and so on. Yesterday he spoke lyrical in defence of the constitution. But he now complains that the constitution does not give the Senate or the parliament the power to ratify international agreements. The power lies with the executive. That is how the constitution was written nearly 100 years ago&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By a group of people who believed that was the way it ought to be written. That is how they saw the performance of the executive of government. There was no reference that these things have to be approved by parliament. We are different from the American Senate, which has to approve all foreign treaties. That example was already there, but they ignored it. They chose the example of Great Britain, where the executive could do that off its own bat without reference to the parliament of Westminster. That may well be a deficiency in our constitution, but it will be changed only by holding a referendum. It may be a referendum that Senator Kemp will choose to support. Maybe the treaties ought to be ratified by resolution after debate in the parliament. But the government has every right to do what it is doing because that is what the constitution says&mdash;a constitution which Senator Kemp now goes around this country saying is wonderful and not in need of revision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) is saying, `If it ain't broke, why mend it?' That is what he is saying all over the country. Mr Downer is saying, `It is a wonderful constitution. Why change it?' Senator Kemp is now squealing that the constitution allows the executive to ratify UN conventions without reference to the parliament. He has identified an area where he now believes the constitution is broke and he wants to fix it. So he has been caught out. Mr Downer at one level says that it is a wonderful constitution and at another level Senator Kemp wants to say the opposite&mdash;that it is terrible that under this constitution the executive can do what it is doing. So he has been caught out. This is typical of the duplicity and the double standards of this opposition, which has no consistency on policy. The only thing it wants to do is nitpick on particular issues and lose all consistency of policy and substance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was fascinated also by the document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National action plan: Australia</EMPHASIS>, particularly in respect of health policy. It is obvious to me that the authors of this document were totally unaware of the ACTU-caucus working party. The objectives in this report have no relationship at all to the government's ACTU-caucus working party and the decisions that it handed to cabinet yesterday. This is yet another example of the government having no idea what to do about the crisis in health care in this country, other than pretend that it does not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, the only thing that the former health minister did in relation to health in the year he occupied that position was to recognise there were problems. He produced a mechanism to do something about them, which has been effectively dumped by the ACTU-caucus working party. No solutions at all have been put forward. I was fascinated to read on page 24 of this document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific action includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">restructuring the way general practice is organised and financed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or the Australian Medical Association were not aware of this document. Effectively what happened in the budget in May is that the rebates to patients were reduced to half of what they would have been had the original decision of the government and the line that it sold those two bodies before the budget gone ahead. The patients were duchessed by the government, because only when they get their rebates will they discover that the rebates are half what they should have been with the increase. It is another way of bringing in co-payment, because that is eventually what will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that is occurring in terms of restructuring is the introduction of divisions and accreditation into general practice. Already accreditation has fallen foul of the organisers, and the RACGP is not prepared to go ahead under the government's design. It is an attempt to do away with fee-for-service practice and to introduce that amount of money into the accreditation process. Page 25 of the action plan states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. introducing further measures to reduce waiting lists for public patients by allowing public patients to be treated in private hospitals . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that that was the $100 million. It was not spent, and $78 million of it has gone into the Aboriginal health program. Nobody denies that that money needs to be spent. This document, tabled today, states what the government is going to do. It is going to introduce further measures to reduce waiting lists for public patients by allowing public patients to be treated in private hospitals. That has been withdrawn totally, yet the action plan still states that that is going to occur. The thing that really drew my ire was this statement on page 25:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Breast Cancer Screening Program aims to screen 1.7 million women over 40 years old by 1995/96 and to continue to offer screening every two years.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's own accreditation process states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program is being progressively implemented in all states and territories over a five-year period and is planned to be fully operational in 1996 when it is anticipated that 860,000 women per year will be screened.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly half the number that is stated in this report. I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this report is almost a farrago of lies. It is a wish list, a pious presentation to the international community as to what the government would like to do but has not got the wit to do. There is nothing about, for example, the free fall that is occurring in private health insurance where people are dropping out of the private health system and are dependent on the public health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether Senator Crowley likes it or not, there are only two systems: the public hospital system and the private hospital system. If patients drop out of the private hospital system, they need to be looked after by the public hospital system&mdash;not by the Salvation</PARA>
<PARA>Army. There is no other body available. They are dependent on the public hospital system. No matter what anybody says in the government, somebody has to look after those people. They still have accidents, they still have babies. They are going to be dependent on the public hospital system. That issue is not addressed in this document; it is not even mentioned. </PARA>

In other words, if the government brings legislation in, utilises the external affairs power, points to an article of a particular treaty for that purpose and ignores a decision of a Senate committee which had been previously tabled in the parliament in respect of that article, then we would not expect to get that legislation through the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying that there is nothing in the constitution which would prevent a proper discussion by the parliament and the public of matters relevant to international treaties prior to their being signed. That is all very good. I am not suggesting that the executive prerogative should be overruled by parliament because we would then diminish parliament's proper functions of audit and control. But what I am suggesting is that the parliament should have more say over treaties and international instruments of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process should be a lot more open than it is at present. As a member of the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I need to advise the Senate that we did consider this report, but we also expressed concern that the report was developed prior to any consultation with us. The human rights subcommittee of that Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was not consulted prior to this document being developed. We expressed that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not think anyone is putting a blanket condemnation on the work that has been done in this document. Much of this work has been very worth while. I think there is something to be said for Australia taking a lead on human rights issues for its own sake and as an example for other countries to follow. Nevertheless, I do make the point that it is important that the department and the government openly provide opportunities for the parliament and the public to consider matters relevant to treaties prior to their being signed or agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about the national action plan. I support the comments of my Senate colleagues. The broad thrust of their arguments has been that this really is a glossy picture of Australia's human rights record. It has been put together very quickly. It is a monument to the federal government's international posturing on human rights and its ignoring of them at home in Australia. I will pick out three examples in the report in the short time available to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to the very process, to which Senator Harradine has just referred, of putting the report together. We see in the tabling statement of Senator Gareth Evans that the national action plan was put together by the Australian federal government and that there was effectively no consultation with the states. One of the things that we have to do in a democracy, if we want to protect human rights, is to ensure that power is kept close to the people. Australia has chosen to do that by having a federal system of government. That is something that we will celebrate in the years leading up to the centenary of our federation, but it is something that has been undermined by this federal government in particular over the last 11 years. It has sought to centralise more power here in Canberra away from the state and local levels of government and to concentrate more and more power in the hands of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that Senator Evans was so keen to rush off and have this report tabled in the United Nations on 22 February when on 21 June it is being tabled in the Australian Senate. In other words, the government goes off to the United Nations and tables our national action plan before it is considered by a joint committee of the parliament and before it comes into the Senate. This is a classic monument to the way this arrogant, tired government treats the Australian parliamentary process. So it is a bit of joke that here we are saying what a great democracy we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other points in this report. There is a chapter on labour relations, which Senator Abetz will not be surprised to hear. I will leave it to him to make some comments about that. The plan goes through all the high sounding principles in relation to ensuring that people have the right to just and favourable conditions of work and the right to form and join trade unions. I hope that our international friends who read this report will recognise that nowhere on all the pages regarding people's rights to join unions is there any mention of the right for Australians not to join unions if they so choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a freedom that this federal government denies people in industrial trade unions. It is also a freedom that this government specifically seeks to deny students on campuses. This government uses its coercive financial powers to force young Australians to join unions and pay hundreds of dollars in membership fees against their will. It needs to be highlighted to the international community that this government is not far dinkum about giving Australian citizens the freedom to choose not to join unions. They are coerced into joining unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another section of this report goes to the government's credibility in relation to strengthen democratic processes. Page 71 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These mechanisms include the scrutiny of government by parliamentary committees and administrative processes which provide for access to information and review of decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the Senate passed resolutions on 5 May and 10 May asking that the Minister for Administrative Services table documents in relation to his portfolio. He held this parliament in contempt and continues to do so. That is how fair dinkum the government is about accountability and democratic institutions. If it does not suit the government, it does not give the parliament the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, a commitment was given by this government in March to increase the powers and financial resources of the Auditor-General, yet in last month's budget it cut the resources of the independent Auditor-General in Australia by 17 per cent. This is a great commitment to accountability. The Auditor-General has said publicly that his office cannot carry out its statutory obligations. That too should be recognised by the international community when it sees Senator Evans trying to win a Nobel Peace Prize for human rights, or become Secretary-General of the United Nations, or whatever else he is trying to do with this document. He is not fair dinkum and his actions do not match his words. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the Senate long, but this matter will be submerged if I do not raise it now. It relates to funds being sought from the Advance to the Minister for Finance for an ex-gratia payment to Mr Josef Tokic, as approved by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in April 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate would be aware that Mr Tokic received a bullet wound to the neck while taking part in a demonstration outside the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Woollahra, Sydney, in November 1988. Mr Tokic sued the government of Yugoslavia for damages for negligence in respect of the incident. In December 1991 the court awarded him $46,854, including costs. The application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ex-gratia payment was sought on the grounds that it was not possible to execute the judgment against the Government of Yugoslavia. The defendant government (Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) no longer exists and is unlikely to be replaced by a government which would assume the judgment debt. Due to the current political circumstances in the former Yugoslavia, the Australian government cannot exert the level of diplomatic influence it would in normal situations. Because of consular immunity, it is not possible to take action against the Consul-General of the Government of Yugoslavia in Sydney, or other assets of the Government held in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Finance approved an Act of Grace payment, due to the unique circumstances which exist to prevent Mr Tokic enforcing the judgment. The Act of Grace payment is made on the condition that the judgment debt is assigned to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that all honourable senators would support the fact that Mr Tokic is to receive his money. It is a disgrace that it has taken so long for him to get his money&mdash;from December 1991. The problem is why on earth this government is not proceeding against the property held by the former government of Yugoslavia in Australia. It seems to me totally inadequate to say that consular immunity prevents the government from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the government's attention the fact that in the United States the various cities are now proceeding against the consular and diplomatic officials for multimillions of dollars in relation to back parking fines that have resulted from the arrogant way in which diplomatic and consular representatives have ignored the rules in relation to parking in those municipalities and cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am under the impression that if the government had such a mind it could well proceed against assets held here by the former government of Yugoslavia. I regret, firstly, the massive delay in making the payment to Mr Tokic and, secondly, the fact that the government has shown no enthusiasm in pursuing this matter. As a result the taxpayers of Australia have to foot the bill&mdash;of course, Mr Tokic is totally entitled to get the money&mdash;when the government of Australia should be</PARA>
<PARA>exercising, what I understand to be, its rights to get restitution from the former government of Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the factors involved is that it has taken so long for the government to do anything about it. That may have increased the problems involved. If the government has taken a different view from the view taken by the United States authorities, I think it owes it to the Senate and to the people of Australia to explain why. The Americans can pursue diplomats for these judgment debts, as I understand it in these matters, whereas the Australian government apparently finds itself incapable of doing so. </PARA>

Some overseas borrowings are undertaken as a result of the links between subsidiaries in Australia and their overseas parent companies. For example, the proportion of debt in foreign direct investment in recent years in Australia has been around 20 per cent. Australia's thin capitalisation laws act to limit tax deductions for interest on debt owed to a foreign controller (or a non-resident associate of a foreign controller) where the debts exceeds the permitted ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity. The permitted debt to equity ratio is generally 3:1. For financial institutions the ratio is 6:1.</PARA>
