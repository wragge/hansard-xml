<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I remind the minister that before the last election Mr Keating promised no new taxes. He quickly broke that promise and scrapped the l-a-w law income tax cuts. Now his Treasurer, Mr Willis, is refusing to rule out further tax increases. I ask the minister: what value is a promise from his government when it so easily disregards that promise when the election is over? For the benefit of small businesses and families trying to recover from Mr Keating's recession, will he now tell all Australians when taxes are going to rise, which taxes are going up and to what extent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate would have heard the Prime Minister respond to this question; I have very little to add to what he said. The situation is that we have put in place the receipt side of a policy that will generate an outstanding fiscal result&mdash;better than for just about any other country in the world&mdash;by 1996-97, and one that is perceived to be responsible and appropriate for Australia's economic circumstances. We have a fiscal policy that is travelling well, accompanied by a monetary policy in balance with it, and which makes perfect sense in achieving those longer term objectives. Accordingly, given all known and reasonably anticipatable circumstances, there is no basis for contemplating any change on the fiscal side of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, as the Treasurer has made clear&mdash;there is nothing new in any of this&mdash;it is not appropriate to be ruling in or out absolutely all speculation or all anticipated outcomes about particular use of different arms of policy at some time in the future should the circumstances that I have described change. What the government has said, and what it absolutely continues to stand by in all circumstances, is that we will not increase the overall burden of taxation. We have said that on innumerable occasions. We have absolutely honoured that commitment and we will continue to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to commend the organisers of the highly successful Northern Territory trade expo which was held during the past weekend. A record crowd of over 25,000 people attended the three-day event in Darwin. Given that Darwin's population is just over 70,000 in total, that was quite a turnout. More than 300 Indonesian business people representing over 70 companies attended, along with a number of important trade delegations. The expo director, Simon Latimer, has stated that the expo will provide valuable reference material for consultants to the Wran committee&mdash;that is, the Darwin committee&mdash;which has been asked by the federal government to investigate a range of initiatives to promote Darwin as Australia's gateway to Asia. A number of export and import prospects are reported to have flowed from the expo, including solar technology, cut flowers and other horticultural products to Irian Jaya and the import to Darwin of furniture and cane products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all honourable senators would be aware, the Prime Minister is leaving Canberra this afternoon for Indonesia&mdash;as, indeed, is the trade minister. One of the Prime Minister's main tasks will be to open the $12 million `Australia Today, Indonesia 94' trade and cultural promotion in Jakarta, which is the largest promotion of Australian goods and services yet to take place anywhere in the world. I am confident that this promotion will further enhance opportunities for new export markets for Australian business, particularly in the primary industries and energy sector. No-one can overstate the importance of such events.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by referring to the fact that yesterday the Treasurer conceded that the government would resort to tighter monetary and fiscal policy&mdash;that is, higher interest rates and higher taxes&mdash;to control inflation and to attempt to make the economic recovery sustainable. Why was there no mention in those policy options of adjustments to the cost and supply side of our economy, such as reductions in business taxes and further labour market reform, that are the real key to sustained recovery? Further, I ask: why does the government refuse to concede that it is reductions in business taxes, reductions in budget deficits and reductions in government regulations that are the key to investment and jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1988" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no ground for any suggestion, as was implicit and, indeed, partly explicit in Senator Short's question, that there is any risk so far as the inflationary environment in Australia is concerned. There is every reason to believe that that is simply not the case. There is no ground for concern, and we can expect a very good inflationary outcome to continue well into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison with most other countries, particularly the United States, there is still a significant degree of unused capacity in the Australian economy. Wage pressures continue to be extremely low, as evidenced by the increase of only 0.5 per cent in average weekly earnings over the year to the March quarter. The ACTU and the government are committed, with a recent further agreement about the $8, to wage outcomes consistent with maintaining inflation absolutely comparable with or better than that of our major trading partners; wage increases are increasingly being linked very directly to productivity improvements which will guarantee just that. Australia is a much more open and internationalised economy and, as a result, firms have a greater incentive to contain price increases than used to be the case in the past. A great many firms have lowered their cost structures through extensive workplace bargaining and inflationary expectations&mdash;an important indicator of the future&mdash;are at historically low levels with the Melbourne Institute's index falling, for example, again in June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that if and when inflationary pressures, not necessarily inflation itself but simply inflationary expectations, start to rise in a rationally founded way, the government will consult with the Reserve Bank in relation to any decision to raise interest rates. We have said right from the outset of this whole debate that one has to anticipate a situation, as pressure for funds increases as the recovery gathers pace, in which the cost of money will rise. We will have to take that into account as well as taking into account some of the pressures that are being generated from overseas. But one has had a situation of fiscal policy being tightened in the 1994-95 budget and one also has a situation where the deficit that is forecast for 1996-97 is now, in fact, not over, not around, but less than one per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background against which the government is crafting its fiscal and its monetary policy. Again, I draw attention to the contrast with the absolute fiscal irresponsibility of the opposition. Like a great lolloping labrador, Alexander Downer loves going around offering political bones to miscellaneous interest groups here, there and everywhere about what sorts of tax concessions he will offer, wagging his tail for approval, dripping saliva and saying, `What a good little doggy am I' but, at the same time, creating an environment where the opposition is simply not answering the basic questions about the overall condition of Australia's fiscal future. The opposition cannot create a $8 billion hole through taxation offers of one kind or another plus expenditure offers of one kind or another without demonstrating how it will not, in fact, contribute massively to inflation through total irresponsibility on its part. So Senator Short should not lecture me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I can understand the minister's testiness, given the way he has been trying to act in the last couple of days. If the government really believes that the rosy scenario that Senator Evans has painted is real life, why did the Treasurer make it clear yesterday that tighter fiscal and monetary policies&mdash;that is, higher interest rates and higher taxes&mdash;are on the way?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not make clear anything of the kind. The Treasurer, being an absolutely cautious and totally responsible manager of this economy, made the point&mdash;as he has always made the point in every public utterance&mdash;that one cannot ignore the possibility of some adjustments of various monetary or various fiscal levers being required at some stage in the future. We have said, the Treasurer has said, the Prime Minister has said, I have said in this place over and over again that one does have to anticipate that, as the recovery cycle moves down the track, there will be some extra pressure on interest rates&mdash;we know that. We know that some adjustments at some stage will have to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is: we will not make those adjustments now. We will not do it in relation to the demands that are being made upon us by a financial market that is simply not paying regard to the fundamentals of this economy. We are not, like the opposition, barracking for the bond holders. We are barracking for Australian home owners. We are barracking for those who want to maintain rates low enough to enable us to get the investment flowing that we need to get the jobs growth flowing in this economy. We are being responsible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday the Prime Minister's science and engineering council held one of its regular meetings. ASTEC, the Australian Science and Technology Council, made a report of a foresight study, as it termed it, of Australia's scientific and technological needs to the year 2010 and what Australia's science capability will be. This study will focus on those elements and enable us to, if you like, benchmark the total Australian science effort and look at areas where, given trends and changes in science and society, we need to refocus our policy-making goals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenges that we will face in the early part of the next century will involve changes in environmental science and in the natural environment of Australia and the globe, changes brought on by the ageing of the Australian population&mdash;that mainly focuses on health, but not exclusively&mdash;changes in employment patterns and the changed role of work in the future as well as Australia's place in the world, particularly our relationship with Asia. To understand those needs against that background, we are going to look at, as I say, through this foresight study, our capability and our needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not trying to redevelop the existing Australian science and technology policy framework, however. The study will build on existing statements of government policy by focusing on the future. It will be the vehicle for the government to consider longer term science and technology issues. The insights gained from this study will feed into broader policy development processes to complement and provide an additional dimension to our existing policy work. Other OECD countries have undertaken similar sorts of studies. They include Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the European Union. Those studies have demonstrated by their future orientation that the analysis is worth while and has played a useful role in setting priorities for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, close links between the people undertaking this study and our premier science institutions, such as the CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS. This will be built on and developed further in the course of the study. We recognise that the Industry Commission is also undertaking a study focusing on existing research and development and the role of government in supporting that and that the government has commissioned EPAC, the economic advisory body to the government, to look at socioeconomic demands in the future. I would expect all of those studies to be embraced by the ASTEC study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it will be a seminal work for Australia, something of great interest to the science community and something to make sure that ordinary Australians are brought more into the science debate and consider the development of technology and science in the future as to how it will affect their lives. Importantly, for all of those concerned about good government and good policy making, it will be a status quo statement which will show what we have now and what will be the trends in the future to enable proper policy debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, the administration of schools is a state matter and the issue of accepting sponsorship is administered by state education departments. Private sector schools make their own individual arrangements. But the government believes it is appropriate that business, as one of the main beneficiaries of our school system, should make an investment in a suitable way&mdash;but we emphasise `in a suitable way'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All education ministers, Commonwealth and state, have agreed to a national voluntary code of conduct governing sponsorship in school education. There are some points of principle here about access for all students, the conditions associated with participation and whether the types of sponsorship activity involved are suitable for schools. I think all education ministers are aware of the need to monitor activities in this area. At the end of this answer, I will table the national code of practice for sponsorship and promotion in school education for the information of senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has had discussions in the appropriate forums with state ministers of education. One of the areas of emphasis, as is outlined in the code, is to ensure that there is equity about any such sponsorship and that it is set within appropriate guidelines and rules. If there is debate about those, it ought quite rightly to be a community debate taken up with state and federal ministers. The federal government does not oppose outright sponsorship but believes that if there is to be sponsorship it is to be done within the code, open and transparent, and as part of community debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also say, in case anybody makes the comment that sponsorship is required because of the lack of federal government involvement and spending in education, that since 1983 in real terms this government has increased the funding to schools by $1 billion. That means that there is now an annual budget of some $3 billion to schools in Australia from the federal government. This increase has now been legislated to 1996, giving schools security and stability in their arrangements for Commonwealth funding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked whether fossil fuel dependence is a major problem in itself for Australia and whether our reliance on coal, natural gas and petroleum constitutes a major problem.

I would say that it is certainly an important issue in the greenhouse gas and greenhouse emissions debate but whether it constitutes a major problem for Australia is another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hold the view that Australia, as a net exporter of energy that, by high environmental emission control standards, has developed world leading technology in pollution control and the cutting of greenhouse gas emissions, is showing a way in which the total emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by a developed industrialised society can be reduced. This important contribution that we are making has to be considered in the broad sweep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make is that carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. But so are methane and nitrous oxide. One needs to have a strategy to cut emissions across the board in all gas categories, not just in the carbon dioxide category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pursuing a greenhouse gas strategy. It has a national greenhouse gas response strategy. It is a response which balances effective measures and the need to control emissions with the need to protect Australia's vital economic and trade interests. The response forms the leading edge of a round table of non-government organisations chaired by Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall, the Minister for Resources. It has brought out a need to continue to address suitable measures and to do so consistent with Australia's circumstances.</PARA>

Our black coal, the coal Australia exports, is highly energy efficient and burns with far lower levels of impurities than the dirty brown coals burnt in Europe and, classically, in Asia as well. Our coal burning technology has been perfected to reduce the level of emissions, to scrub the emissions that do occur and to reduce the greenhouse gas effect.

My question is about the role of former Senator Graham Richardson in this takeover. The minister will recall that our former colleague had a censure motion moved against him for his failure to declare a pecuniary interest as a director of radio 2HD in April 1992.

Recently it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the franchise review would be expedited. I understand that originally it was intended to review the franchising code of practice early next year but that the minister has decided to bring the review forward by six months. Is the minister able to provide any further information on the purpose and nature of the review? Why has it been necessary to bring forward the timing of the review?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1993" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS, CUSTOMS AND CONSTRUCTION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The franchising industry in Australia has a turnover per annum of between $30 billion and $40 billion. It is one of the major growth sectors in the Australian economy and more and more small businesses are coming into being through the franchising system. So it has a very important role in the economy. Back in 1991 the then Minister for Small Business and Customs, Mr Beddall, as a result of many complaints from the industry, and particularly franchisees, established a task force to look at whether there should be legislative action or a voluntary code for the relationship between franchisors and franchisees. As a result of that task force's recommendation, which was accepted by the government, a voluntary code of practice was established in which franchisors, franchisees, organisations, groups and individuals were asked to sign up and work with a common code of practice. It has an independent chair and representatives from various parts of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code has been established and operating for about 18 months, but there have still been some complaints from some sections of the industry, particularly from some franchisees, that not all the major franchisors in Australia have signed the code. In particular, there is a lot of disappointment in one part of the industry that the federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has not signed the voluntary code in view of a celebrated case last year when a car dealer had a dispute with a major car manufacturer in Australia. The cost of that court case ran into tens of millions of dollars with no satisfactory outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This indicates that there is dissatisfaction. Though the operation of the code was to be reviewed by the end of this year, I decided that it would be in the interests of the industry if the review were brought forward. The review is about to be established. I hope to be able to make an announcement in the near future of those people participating in carrying out the inquiry and the review of the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general terms of reference for the review will include the effectiveness of the franchising code of practice, the effectiveness of the Franchising Code Administration Council and areas of dispute that are not directly covered by the code and methods used to address them. The inquiry will be asked to report to the government on any deficiencies in the code and its administration, recommendations to address any such deficiencies, implementation strategies and the implications of adopting each recommendation. The fundamental issue that the review will deal with is whether there should be a legislative outcome for operation of franchising in Australia and whether we should move from a voluntary code to a legislative outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far the government has resisted such requests from many franchisees, but this is an area where we believe it is timely to have such a review and have advice given to the government. Only after very careful consideration will the government step towards a legislative outcome. One thing we do not want, though, is six state governments with six different legislative codes of practice for the franchising industry because that would make it a costly and duplicative system, which would be to the disadvantage of this very important part of the private sector in Australia.</PARA>

I am not entirely clear why the question has been directed to me, except that I understand that my own department did prepare a technical paper for a preparatory meeting of a proposed regional hazardous wastes convention which addresses some of those issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Coulter's second question concerning our seriousness with regard to an option to export spent fuel rods to Scotland, all options for disposal of HIFAR spent fuel are currently being considered by the government, as I have said, in the context of the research reactor review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his third question Senator Coulter said that the option blatantly contradicted the promise made by the Prime Minister to prohibit the import of high-level radioactive waste. It does not contradict any such statement made by the Prime Minister because that statement was deliberately cast in terms of prohibiting the import of high-level radioactive waste of foreign origin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is an important part of the process and that aspect has been raised by Senator Cooney. One growth industry in which Australia's culturally diverse work force is an obvious asset is, of course, tourism. Tourism contributed some 5.5 per cent to our gross domestic product in 1991-92, and was estimated in that year to have employed more than 450,000 people, or six per cent of the work force. Last year tourism accounted for almost three million international visitors to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the profile of tourists coming to Australia, one can see that it is changing enormously.

This means that the majority of visitors to Australia do not have English as their first language.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, in a joint undertaking with the New Zealand ministry for commerce and industry, the council commenced a study on the spread of best practice in manufacturing in Australia and New Zealand. It expects to complete that study in September this year. Last Thursday it issued an interim report showing how that study is progressing, and it came up with some interesting observations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the study examines the spread of best practice in manufacturing industry, measures the effectiveness of that as a management tool and assesses the impact of best practice on managerial performance in companies. The survey examined 1,000 manufacturing companies in Australia and 379 manufacturing companies in New Zealand. It found that, where companies benchmark themselves against the best performed companies in their industry sector in the world, the companies that undertook the rigorous self-examination of benchmarking tend to be the companies that perform among the best in Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the performance of those companies as against those that do not, we would categorise the benchmarkers or the best practice companies as being in the top 20 per cent in both countries and those that do not have any element of comparison of their performance with the best performed companies in the world would be categorised in the bottom 20 per cent. For the sake of this study, the AMC has tagged the top 20 per cent as the leaders and the bottom 20 per cent as the laggers and tried to get a profile of what a leading company looks like and what a lagging company looks like in both areas. When we look at that profile, we find that in sales performance, in increased exports, in a solid cash flow for the companies, in increases in employment by the companies, the leaders perform in applying best practice far better than do the laggers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, we can summarise it by saying that the attitude of the leading companies in Australasia is not to worry or be concerned about what might be termed the preoccupations of whether or not the labour market is flexible, whether or not there is sufficient investment capital, whether or not all the sorts of things we hear about in terms of micro-economic reform have been done. The leaders do not worry about those things. The leaders worry about access to the market and how they can export their goods into the market. Their profile is one of being out there, go-getting, trying to perform and overcome the constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laggers are inwardly focused and cite as difficulties in achieving better performance the labour market, access to finance and all of those other things that we constantly hear about. The laggers remind me in political terms very much of the opposition and its carping criticism about the performance of the Australian economy. The difference is one of approach. If one wants to perform, one is focused on the market. If one does not perform, one is focused on finding excuses for failure. That seems to be what this study shows. The AMC is developing a diagnostic which will help lagging companies that wish to be leading companies change their managerial culture and approach. It will make that available to Australian banks as well, to enable those banks to assess applications for loans, particularly from small to medium sized businesses, more effectively.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be many reasons why anyone ever leaves a position. But there is a general problem in the degree of remuneration of senior public servants compared with what they can achieve in the private sector. That is true right across the Public Service, but especially in the higher echelon. Public servants have suffered very much from what is regarded to be an indirect tie&mdash;even though there is no direct tie&mdash;between their salaries and those of politicians, which can never rise because it is never popular and no-one has ever had, if you like, the intestinal fortitude to take that to its logical conclusion and level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the problem has been exacerbated by the fact that state governments have had no such restraint. We have a situation where the head of the premier's department in Victoria gets paid $300,000, the head of the Totalisator Agency Board in Victoria gets a package of well in excess of $600,000 a year, yet the best that a public servant in Australia can get&mdash;and I think there are three paid at the top level&mdash;is around $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many and varied reasons why public servants leave. As Senator Short said, some do so because they do not like their minister. Some go because they are sick of the Public Service&mdash;there is always labour mobility. But the real problem, in my view, is that many of them see different levels of remuneration. For example, the secretary to my department probably gets paid half of that paid to the managing directors of two companies wholly owned by the defence department&mdash;half!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill says, `Oh, the state governments have addressed these particular issues.' The state governments have addressed these issues in a very inconsistent way. The state governments are saying to three or four of the head honchos&mdash;the lackeys that the Liberal Party can drag up from somewhere&mdash;that they will get their jobs. But they are saying to the rest of the public servants, `You take the redundancy. You get out.' All the party to which those opposite belong does is pick three or four Liberal stooges, put them in charge of the state departments and remunerate them at that level. The state premiers go around preaching wage restraint and attacking the union movement, attacking the working class, at the same time as being willing to pay a public servant $300,000 a year. That is how one gets a resigned police minister in New South Wales spending $150,000 on an armour-plated police car to take him around the joint.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 June 1994, Senator Vanstone asked a question in respect of an FOI application by Mr Christopher Skase, through his lawyers. I am informed that an FOI request was received from Clayton Utz, Skase's solicitors, in Brisbane on 31 January 1994. The Attorney-General's Department replied to Clayton Utz on 18 February 1994, notifying the lawyers that a fee of $185 would attach to the processing of the request with a deposit of $46.25 required as per the FOI Act. This fee was based on the department's estimate of time required to answer the request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 February 1994, Clayton Utz requested that the fee be waived or be reduced to $70 because the information was personal to Mr Skase and that he had an inalienable right to such information, claiming that he was a person of limited financial means. On 22 March 1994, the Attorney-General's Department replied to Clayton Utz agreeing to reduce the fee to $70 because the information was personal to Skase. The sum of $70 was the maximum permissible for the provision of such personal information. In doing so, the department's response stated that consideration had been given to all the grounds he had claimed, amongst which was his claim of limited financial resources, but that this did not change the basic point that the charge was reduced because the request related to personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as a consequence, $70 was charged since that was the maximum permissible amount in relation to personal information requests under the schedule to the act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would like to make some brief remarks about your speech in Darwin. I thought it was an unfair reflection on the work of estimates committees. I did some analysis of the amount of time that estimates committees take to consider the government's estimates, and it does take a long time. Accountability and parliamentary scrutiny of the executive can be a very tedious process. In all the estimates committees with which I have been involved over the last four years there have been a number of examples where coalition senators have uncovered things that have attracted media attention. Senator Hill has just outlined a few of them, from the Centenary House scandal to Ruben's dog kennel&mdash;from the bizarre and the corrupt to the ridiculous. Of course those things will attract media attention. In defence of the coalition getting that sort of attention&mdash;that scandalising as you, Mr President, may have called it&mdash;it is a crucial part of the political process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day by day, hour by hour minutia analysis of government expenditure is an extremely boring business&mdash;e-b-b. That is why creating scandal and political heat is such a crucial part of the estimates process. Unless we can attract the attention of the press gallery&mdash;which is absolutely packed today: welcome to the AAP!&mdash;we will not apply any political heat to the government, and there will be no accountability. If we do not create the political heat, we do not get the accountability. It is not until we turn the political heat up on the government that accountability really works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, Senators Parer, Baume and Campbell did some analysis of some sporting grant figures, starting with September 1990. It took until 1994 for the political impact of that to hit this government. So unless we create scandal, we do not create accountability. The accountability package that Senator Gareth Evans announced here in March 1994 was a result of work that was carried out in the estimates committees back in September 1990. So it is a long cause and effect, but it is a good cause. If we did not get those odd bits of media from estimates&mdash;an absolutely crucial part of the process; the scandalising, grandstanding, and opposition senators raising these points and creating political scandal and controversy&mdash;the estimates would not be as valuable as they are. But that is but a small part of what the estimates do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I do not know how aware you are of that work. The hours used to consider the budget estimates in the Senate estimates process we are about to conclude, totalled 34 or 35 eight-hour days&mdash;34 man days or person days, to use modern politically correct jingo. That is an enormous amount of time. All ministers are aware of the time that we spend in estimates. Behind the time that we actually spend in the committees themselves is the time that our staff put into doing the research of all of the documents that make up the consideration of the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliamentary scrutiny of the executive is seen by the government as a waste of time. When we seek more information from the government about Transport Workers Union deals, the Centenary House deal and the deals in Casselden Place in Melbourne, those opposite always think that it is a commercial secret of the government and that the opposition and the parliament have no right to know about these secret dealings. But they are on the wrong foot. </PARA>

We are very proud to have exposed a number of those and to show that this government is in many respects a government of economic mismanagement and a government that mismanages the daily departmental business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues have been read out by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, in which the Senate committees have been put to particularly good use. I could add another couple of issues to those, particularly the fact that former Senator Richardson paid a million dollars to the wrong company. It should have been paid to a particular firm in Ravenshoe that was getting rid of its assets out the back door. Former Senator Richardson paid more than a million dollars to a firm that had no relationship to the firm that should have been receiving the government compensation. I might add that former Senator Richardson was censured by the Senate for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation this parliament had to have some influence on the decisions regarding what the government was doing wrong. I ask you, Mr President, whether there could be a mistake worse than a government minister's department paying out a million dollars to the wrong company and whether you think the Senate should bring up issues such as that. I think that you would have to agree that that is a very relevant issue for the opposition to pick up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the sorts of issues that the opposition has exposed through the committees, but there are other reasons for estimates committees. One is to get information, and that is why I think most senators use those committees. For example, I have found out how much money has been allocated to RAS. I pursued Senator Collins over the last three months on every estimates committee. We found that $88 million is going to RAS and, in our opinion, that is totally insufficient to prop up a rural community that is going through very hard times at the moment. Let us look at the CoT investigations that we raised whereby a number of small business people were not receiving adequate telephone services. We investigated those through the estimates committees. The outcome was that Telecom set up a special arbitrator to investigate and compensate those people who have gone broke or lost money. </PARA>

Their only defence is to bring their problems to the opposition for us to raise in the parliament, and the only way we can do that is by getting information through estimates committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in this important debate. Unlike Senator Coates, I am a strong supporter of people in this chamber writing articles and making speeches. I listened with great interest to Senator Coates's speech because I remember that he attempted to make quite a name for himself by attacking the Clerk of the Senate because of speeches he made and papers he wrote. I am greatly in favour of the President going out and making speeches which recognise the very high office that the President holds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you will be acutely aware because of the debate that has occurred in this chamber over the last couple of years in relation to the behaviour of Mr Keating and his approach to the Senate that people in this chamber are particularly sensitive about these issues. I think the attitude of Mr Keating has put particular pressure on the President of this chamber to act in a way which can be seen to be promoting the interests of this chamber in a constructive and effective way and defending this chamber against the sort of abuse that we have to cop from Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought some aspects of the paper were important in terms of the development of the committee system. I was interested to read your remarks about that, Mr President. However, I take issue, Mr President, with one particular part of your paper. On page 7 you make the statement that the estimates committees are an opposition show. We can all debate what `show' means. This is true of Labor in opposition as much as it is of the current opposition. I was here from 1977 to 1982 when I was a senior adviser to a minister in the former government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he is experienced. Senator Neal and Senator Forshaw may have assumed that the senators of the Liberal and National parties when they were in government behaved in the same lazy, indolent manner that Labor senators&mdash;their senators&mdash;behave in estimates committees. I want to tell Senator Neal and Senator Forshaw that I can remember going to estimates committee after estimates committee with my minister and seeing the effective way that people in the Liberal and National parties&mdash;the senators who were in government&mdash;were prepared to ask questions in an attempt to follow through particular issues and facts that they were concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, others will debate other matters in your paper, but it is quite wrong to suggest that senators on this side of the chamber were as lazy and as indolent as the Labor senators are and have been in estimates committees in the last 10 years. I make that point in a constructive manner on the assumption that Senator Neal and Senator Forshaw, who are new to this chamber, will not adopt the same lazy habits of their colleagues in relation to the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is important that you deliver papers and that you give speeches. In this context where the parliament is under constant attack by Mr Keating it is important that you be seen in the public arena to be taking an important and constructive approach to parliament and represent the parliament to the people. Some issues in this paper cause problems and they have been well canvassed by my colleagues. I hope, Mr President, that you see the comments that have been made as constructive. It is difficult to go from being the head of a faction to being the independent presiding officer of this chamber. It is a big leap. We hope that in the future you will make that leap with greater success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will respond very briefly. I notice that the motion moved by Senator Hill based itself completely on press reports and not on the paper itself. I am prepared to be judged by honourable senators on a full reading of the paper, and I would enjoy debating it with any senator or group of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the paper I have attempted to be objective, analytical and balanced. I am fully aware of the position that I hold, and I am not crass enough to break that position. When people say that I was not being balanced about estimates committees, let me quote from page 9 of my paper where I say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates committees have played a major role over the last twenty years in improving the quality and volume of information that the bureaucracy provides to parliament. They have also educated the Public Service in the obligations of accountability. The estimates committees have become linked to program evaluation in the public service with portfolios' program performance statements including ever increasing amounts of performance information. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 10 I say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general the committees have provided a forum in which the findings of the Auditor-General's reports may be followed up and the Audit Office has been keen to cooperate with the committees. In specific instances the committees have also been the vehicle for exposing misuse of funds or other maladministration.</PARA>
<PARA>I also go on to talk about the role that the Department of Finance has played and the support that it has given to the estimates committee process. In the article I quote Senator Short, former Senators Bishop and Puplick, and Senator Coates. I quote some of them at length, notwithstanding that some parts of what they say are critical of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presiding officers and clerks conference that was held in Darwin last week is a forum in which it is expected that issues will be debated; where we will say challenging things and get challenging responses and discuss issues of common concern for parliaments around Australia and in the region close to us. I would hate to see a situation in which I or the clerk would be hogtied by concerns for what might come out of it in some garbled press report. Taking note of my answer may well be a neat opportunity to raise a number of questions, but this really underlines the very point that I was making: any understanding of the estimates committees and of this parliament has to appreciate that this is a political house and that this is a political chamber within that political house. I suggest that most of the comments that have been raised are for political purposes and not out of any great interest in the way that estimates committees or any other committees are operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine asked me a few direct questions. He asked how I came to know that members of the minor parties, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, were involved in the process. I thought that was common knowledge; it was not something that I claim to have got from any insider source. I was also aware of the fact that Mr Dawkins had made a comment to the effect that they would be involved in future; he had made a commitment to that course of action. I make no comments on individual senators. I will not be drawn into doing that now, except that I can say in general terms that I am impressed by Senator Harradine's commitment to committee work in this parliament. I will go no further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I repeat what I said in the initial answer to the question that was put to me in question time. It will be a very sad day if presiding officers, or any other senators, feel constrained in their capacities to comment objectively and analytically on parliamentary matters for fear of selective media reports and political redress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important issue, particularly because it raises some fundamental concerns about the direction of government policy making in relation to the ABC. The ABC has now been with us for in excess of 60 years. In fact, it was founded in 1932. Since that time it has been at the leading edge of public debate in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a number of frustrations that perhaps we all have from time to time about either its coverage or non-coverage, or the slant that we would like to think it puts on issues, the fact is it remains one of our most cherished institutions. We are going into a new, highly competitive era of technology where we will have an abundance of bands and very many options available to people, in terms of both radio and television, as to whether they look at free-to-air services in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Against that background, it is very important that the ABC has some guidance from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about guidance in the sense of telling it precisely what to do or interfering in managerial and administrative decisions. But at the end of the day, like it or not, the taxpayer of Australia funds the ABC to a considerable extent&mdash;in this instance, to the tune of about $515 million. Therefore, I think the taxpayers are entitled to know what view the government of the day has on very important issues such as commercialisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great regret to us that there are some very confusing signals being sent out. The government would appear to have concerns about the ABC's involvement in international satellite television, even though, in principle, it supports that involvement. But because of statements that have been made about the extent to which the ABC is already financially indebted, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has ordered an independent assessment, which, of course, provoked a furious outburst from the managing director, Mr Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That investigation is one thing but, as I understand it, the government has even greater concerns about the whole decision to be involved in pay television, particularly as the ABC board is on the verge of deciding whether to sign up with Australis as a satellite pay delivery operator or, indeed, whether it should get involved in cable television at all, given that one needs very deep pockets and one is up against international competitors with enormous experience. The ABC brings to the party only a licence and whatever is left after $12 1/2 million has been allocated by Senator Collins and his friends. On that basis, the ABC will have to go through this charade that we find in cross media these days, whereby the ABC will have 51 per cent of the voting equity but much less in terms of economic interest or non-voting equity. That, of course, raises some very serious issues, yet we have heard none of these debated by the government. All we have had is constant backgrounding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the point where there is a furious war going on between the minister and the managing director of the ABC. That is something which, surely, is not in the best interests of the corporation, the government or the community. What we ought to have are clear statements of intent and approach by the government. The ABC board ought to then take those matters into account and provide a response. Instead, what we have are these sorts of briefings which appeared in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lee had insisted the ABC chairman, Mark Armstrong, be at the meeting. Now Lee is determined he will not meet Hill on any critical ABC matter in the future without Armstrong's presence. Lee's decision is a direct attack on Hill. It is saying in effect that the minister does not trust Hill to communicate Lee's views to the ABC board or the views of the board to him.</PARA>
<PARA>The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> also quotes one of Mr Hill's most loyal supporters as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">David needs to realise you cannot have total distrust between the managing director of the ABC and the minister.</PARA>
<PARA>If the government does have genuine concerns in these areas, the least it owes the taxpayer is an explanation of those concerns, rather than this sort of off-the-record backgrounding which is clearly an attempt to humiliate the ABC's most senior executive officer. In those circumstances it makes the position of the ABC itself almost untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, raises the even more serious concern about the imminent appointments to the ABC board. The board of the ABC, when it started out under another name, was one that prided itself on its independence. Indeed, as Professor Armstrong, the chairman of the ABC, says in his commentary on communications law and policy in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the ABC's inaugural broadcast, the Prime Minister, Mr Joe Lyons, declared that the government's purpose was to appoint able and impartial trustees for an important national service.</PARA>
<PARA>Now, what do we have? We have a board which consists of seven non-executive directors. If we put aside the chairman and deputy chairman, what we have are three whose greatest claim to fame is extensive Labor Party associations and another two with very extensive trade union experience. That, in itself, may not be a vice on a one-off basis. But when five out of five come from either a close association with the Labor Party or a close association with the trade union movement, where is the balance? Where is the independence? Where is the capacity to provide that editorial integrity that is so important to the ABC? The fact is that the terms of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act make it clear&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not be appointed . . . unless he appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment by reason of his having had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting or television services or in communications or management, by reason of his having expertise in financial or technical matters, or by reason of his cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I have written to the Governor-General today asking him to explain, when the matter comes before the Executive Council on Thursday, the reasons that would warrant the appointment of the persons whose names have been foreshadowed both in this place and by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in another place because it is fundamentally important that the public at large have confidence in the institution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that Senator Alston actually sat down without making out his case. The terms of the debate this afternoon are the alleged lack of morale in the ABC because of the `confusing' signals being sent out by the government. The only other matter raised by Senator Alston was the lack of morale compounded by what he considers to be inappropriate appointments to the ABC board. Let us tackle the first matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC, as Senator Alston said, is a cherished Australian institution which no-one cherishes more than I do. Indeed, I include SBS in that ambit. In terms of the country they serve and the services they deliver, the two organisations together are unique in the world. They are unique services because of the wide spectrum of the Australian community&mdash;particularly the regional community&mdash;that they serve, and the wide spectrum of community purposes that they serve. Therefore, there is a need to have on the board of the ABC people who are capable of reflecting that wide range of interests in the Australian community. I refer particularly to rural and regional Australia, people with particular disabilities&mdash;for example, people who may be disabled in some way and who rely very heavily on the services of the ABC, whether it be on television or radio, to get information about what is going on. Also, organisations such as Radio National have a particular brief in providing invaluable information to a whole range of community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To paraphrase the last paragraph in a letter recently written by Senator Gareth Evans to Mr Downer, `Spare us at least the hypocrisy of this debate', I wonder how anyone in the opposition can stand up with a straight face and talk about lack of morale in the ABC and actions of the government that might contribute to it. How could anybody who has defended, as Senator Alston has done, and promoted the policies which the opposition took to the last election&mdash;and I am not going back into ancient history for this; this is the last federal election&mdash;talk about lack of morale in the ABC? The Opposition's proposals to cut $50 million off public funding for the ABC would have resulted in the removal of about 800 employees from the ABC. How would that have contributed to morale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could boost morale more than knowing that one is on a triennial funding base, which the government has just guaranteed&mdash;as Senator Alston said correctly&mdash;to the tune of $515 million this financial year. That is a great boost to morale. The stark contrast to that are the policies that this coalition&mdash;and Senator Alston was a public advocate of them&mdash;took to the last election. In the view of the ABC board, this would have had the result of `significantly reducing Australian content on ABC television and closing down state based production.' As Senator Panizza knows full well and as I know full well, the local regionally based editions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and so on, which reflect local news and which are extremely expensive to provide, would have been the first casualty in these cuts that were proposed by Senator Alston and his colleagues at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston has the hide, the po-faced hypocrisy to stand up in here and run a debate on lack of morale. His policies would have absolutely decimated morale in the ABC&mdash;policies on which Senator Alston took his party to the last election. So I do not think we need to spend much more time in this 10 minutes that I have to expose the absolute hypocrisy of the opposition, of Senator Alston in particular, in moving an MPI that talks about `confusing' signals. There was nothing confusing about what the coalition wanted to do. </PARA>

So, in comparing contributions to morale, I think the government can hold its head up for having just completed the next triennial funding for the ABC with, as Senator Alston says, $515 million to the ABC and, I think from memory, $75 million to SBS in this current financial year.

Let us have a look at what a current South Australian conservative minister&mdash;Mr Dale Baker&mdash;had to say about Mr Bannon's proposed appointment. I was interested to see this comment because he is a colleague of mine in the sense that he is the South Australian minister for primary industry, and, of course, a former opposition leader.

<PARA>As I commented the other day by way of interjection, did we hear complaints or criticism from the opposition when we reappointed Sir Nicholas Shehadie to chair the SBS board, an appointment that I took to cabinet when I was minister for communications?

Warwick Smith was 40 votes away from being Leader of the Opposition&mdash;how tragic that must have been for him&mdash;and it cost him his seat. He would have been Leader of the Opposition. But we had no difficulty in supporting him to that appointment. Why? Because he was qualified to do the job. Did we hear any screams from the opposition when we appointed Dame Leonie Kramer as the chairman of the board of the ABC? Nothing could reveal more dramatically the complete po-faced hypocrisy of Senator Alston and the opposition on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about with the appointment of Wendy Silver? That is raised in this stunt letter&mdash;that is what it is, and everyone knows it&mdash;to the Governor-General.

She has been executive director of the Association for the Blind in Western Australia since 1988 and a member of a raft of organisations, all appropriate to community affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wording of this matter of public importance suggests that the ABC is in the grip of a crisis, or something very close to it. The Australian Democrats do not agree with that assessment. The ABC seems to us to be carrying out its responsibilities as a public broadcaster with a very strong commitment to quality and the courage to break new ground. But there are problems. The ABC is yet to reconcile its role as a public broadcaster with its commercial services, namely Australia Television and the forthcoming pay TV service. To the extent that the ABC is unsure about its direction, that seems to be why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the ABC's public broadcasting role risks being distorted by its commercial activities. The best solution is for the government to fully fund ATV and pay TV to eliminate that risk, but this has not happened. ATV has therefore called on the ABC's core funds through an internal line of credit. The ABC has assured us that its free to air services will not be affected and that sponsors will be found to fund the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wanting to pre-empt the government's review of ATV funding, we have no reason to doubt the ABC's word. However, the government could solve this problem in a much more satisfactory way by fully funding this important charter activity itself. Failing that, the government should separately fund any Australia Television shortfall to release the ABC from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats await with interest the outcome of the review of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) of ATV funding. If the minister wants to insulate the ABC's free to air services from commercial pressures while providing a high quality international television service&mdash;and I certainly hope he does&mdash;he should consider the options which I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for pay TV, the ABC has again been left in an invidious position by this government, having been allocated two satellite licences by the parliament but inadequate money to fund them. Inevitably, the ABC is being forced to act as a commercial broadcaster to get this service up and running. It has been argued that the ABC has no role in pay TV and the board may yet decide not to proceed. The Democrats believe the ABC should be in pay TV. Surveys suggest that pay TV could become a serious rival to free to air in the medium term. It will be much more difficult for the ABC to get in on the act at that point. The ABC's effectiveness as a public broadcaster could be seriously diminished if it is excluded from pay TV. Conversely, the quality and Australian content of pay TV would be raised with ABC participation. The government should fully fund the ABC's pay TV activities or at least fund any shortfall as a separate budget item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the triggers for this debate has been the suggested appointment to the ABC board of former South Australian Premier John Bannon, amongst others. The Democrats believe that any party political appointment requires a very strong justification and should under no circumstances be a reward for political service or a way of making the board more receptive to the government. While we do not suggest that Mr Bannon's appointment has been made for those reasons, we are not sure on what basis it was made and we will look forward to the answers provided by the Governor-General to Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are very strong supporters of the ABC and, as Senator Collins said, of SBS.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's confusing policy approach to the ABC leading to a serious loss of morale and lack of sense of direction.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a great pity that Senator Collins has left the chamber because I found his defence most curious. He mentioned the issue of loss of morale and his only real defence that morale was high was that if one provides a secure funding base morale will be high. That is a very strange view of an organisation. I would have thought there are a lot of reasons why morale is low in an organisation, and to people with fairly secure employment such as those in the ABC I do not think the financial security of the organisation is a large one. Certainly the way in which the managing director conducts himself, particularly the way in which policy develops in a rather erratic way, is something which, for people who are very concerned and take great pride in their work, can damage morale very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it curious that in his criticisms and in his defence Senator Collins missed out the last part of the MPI, which is the lack of a sense of direction. That is what is concerning us most here today. We hear rumours of the differences between this managing director and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). We believe that the minister has great reason for being concerned about the directions of the ABC under his managing director. The managing director is appointed by the board of the ABC and this perhaps gives him a little more independence than he should have in the direction that he is going. The government is obviously having great difficulty in reining him in in a number of areas, particularly the way in which he is approaching the international arm of the ABC, ATI, and also what is happening with pay TV at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the general idea that the ABC should extend its services. We are supportive of pay TV for the ABC and, in principle, we are supportive of the international initiatives of the ABC. But if the ABC is moving in a new direction&mdash;in particular, if it is moving away from the original charter that was brought in at the time of Joe Lyons to commercial activities&mdash;this should be done in a very considered and planned way. However, there has not been much evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The managing director, David Hill, seems to be moving on a fairly erratic course without any great vision of where it is all going. For example, ATI was supposed to be set up initially as self-funding and yet we see that it is already running into trouble, it cannot meet its budget and it is drawing on the other funding of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One shakes in trepidation at what could possibly happen in the totally unchartered waters of pay television. Initiatives by the government to try to bundle through a number of ABC services were partly blocked by the Trade Practices Commission. The initiatives ran into trouble and this brought about a tantrum from our minister. One wonders what will happen as he moves through a further series of commercial decisions. As a matter of fact, one wonders whether this managing director and, indeed, the board really have the expertise to take on this new type of commercial organisation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders how well it can succeed under the leadership of David Hill. As managing director, he initially brought in a number of reforms which were useful at the time. But if we look in some detail at his reforms, particularly at his reforms in the area of industrial relations, we will see that they were fairly superficial. He seems bored with the job at the moment and likes to move on to new toys. Pay TV and ATI are two of those new toys. I think this parliament should look at this matter with some concern, given his earlier track record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Hill was the head of the New South Wales State Rail Authority. This body ran the railway system in New South Wales. He moved in there on a whim. Neville Wran met him at Pambula show and he came up with some good ideas on railways. All of a sudden, he ended up heading the SRA. David Hill brought in a few showy things such as the XPT trains. But the real reforms that were needed, particularly in the area of industrial relations, were not addressed until Bruce Baird and the Greiner government came along in 1988. They carried out a massive series of needed reforms that really showed the inadequacy of the former director of this area. I suppose the best measure of David Hill's failure with the SRA was the fact that the current government has managed to halve the work force that he had and still have a greater output. One wonders what is going on beneath the surface in the ABC. There have been a few superficial reforms and he is now moving off into the area of new toys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern that someone with such a poor track record is running such an important Australian institution, one that is now moving into new fields such as ATI and pay TV. We should wonder about the ability of this managing director and his board to carry out these activities. Although we can have a crook managing director, at least if we have a strong board we can keep things on the rails. Hence our concern at this time about appointments such as John Bannon. Joe Lyons's view was that the ABC should be balanced and independent. I am sure he would not have envisaged that 50 years down the track there would be three members of the board with ALP affiliations and two with trade union movement associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's defence is that these are all very fine people, and I am sure they are. But if they are there on the basis of political party patronage, and if the managing director is there on a similar sort of basis, one has great fears for the future of this organisation. We need people on the board with vision and commercial background to monitor non-charter financial decisions as the ABC moves into new waters. We do not have this at the moment and the appointment of people such as John Bannon and other Labor cronies should be of great concern to this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not have merit and that is why we are objecting to it most strongly.

The proposal to be discussed states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's confusing policy approach to the ABC leading to a serious loss of morale and lack of sense of direction.</PARA>
<PARA>Public sentiment in my home state of South Australia is running very high as people come to grips with this Labor government's determination to stack the board of the ABC in its favour and, in the process, look after one of its mates. The appointment of Mr Bannon and also of the former Western Australian Burke Labor government adviser, Ms Silver, will mean that five out of seven of the non-employee directors of the ABC have close ties to the Labor Party, either directly to the Labor Party or through the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opinion poll conducted on ABC radio last week revealed that 76 per cent of those who took part were strongly opposed to the appointment of Mr Bannon to the ABC board of directors. This result is not surprising, given that Mr Bannon was the key figure in the $3 billion collapse of the State Bank of South Australia, Australia's worst financial disaster. Many South Australians still hold great distrust of and resentment for Mr Bannon. They are certainly entitled to feel that way because it is as a direct result of his lack of discretion and poor judgment that many South Australians will be forced to endure a painful legacy for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of Mr Bannon and the likely appointment of that further Labor appointee from Western Australia, Ms Wendy Silver, raised disturbing questions about the government's responsibility in determining suitable candidates for such positions. It appears that the selection process for these ABC board positions was lacking in any proper consultation with the management of the ABC. That was made evident when I questioned Senator McMullan last week in estimates committee hearings on this matter. He was not able to provide me with any information on the procedures to be followed, whether there are specific guidelines and criteria laid down which appointees to the board must meet, or what is the basis for these appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear that the only procedure adopted by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) in determining the suitability of a South Australian replacement on the board was his intervention&mdash;the personal intervention of the minister. We now also hear that the minister directly headhunted Mr Bannon for this position. So that was the procedure adopted, along with this Labor Party agenda of stacking the board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. At a time when the ABC is entering into potentially high risk commercial ventures, Asian satellite television, pay television and all the rest, we learn that the sole member of the ABC board with any identified achievements in the commercial sector, Mr Michael Terlet, is to be replaced by the man who cost South Australia $3 billion. Is it any wonder that the man in the street is shaking his head in bewilderment at this government's decision to present John Bannon as a man capable of making executive decisions as a member of the ABC board? Is it any wonder that there has been a serious loss of morale and lack of a sense of direction at the ABC?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blame for this appalling state of affairs rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the minister for communications. Since his appointment, the national broadcaster  has been torn apart by internal bickering and strife. What we now see is the internal problems of the ABC spilling over into the public arena, as evidenced in the nation's weekend newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a story going around that the minister is desperately trying to save his skin and deflect criticism of the Bannon and Silver appointments by seeking yet another political appointment, someone of liberal persuasion, to offset the embarrassment in which he has suddenly found himself. Let me say that it is too late because the minister has shown his true colours and no amount of political dithering or capitulation on this issue will divert attention from his failure and incompetence in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too late for the minister to provide some balance to the ABC board, even if he does find a Liberal appointee to add to the numbers. The reality is that even in that situation, five of the eight non-employee directors would have Labor Party affiliations. The government has seriously undermined the integrity and impartiality of the ABC with its intention to appoint Mr Bannon from South Australia and Ms Silver from Western Australia. Now he is attempting to find a solution and, all the while, we see the morale of the ABC slip further and further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister and this Labor government must be brought to account for their attempts to compromise Australia's national broadcaster with its Labor Party stooges. As much as the minister and the government would like this controversy to fade away, it simply will not. It certainly will not fade away while Mr Bannon and Ms Silver remain on the ABC's board of directors. The public&mdash;certainly from South Australia&mdash;will continue to hound Mr Bannon and the government in relation to this appointment, as it did when he was forced to resign in disgrace as South Australian Premier. If the government persists with these appointments, and stacking the ABC for its own political advantage, the government faces the same fate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is an extremely important report which has been handed down because it raises quite a number of issues as to, firstly, the attitudes that departments have to the reports of the Auditor-General and, secondly, actual findings that the Auditor-General has revealed about the use of the Australian government credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular report follows an earlier report which was done by the Auditor-General. This was in a sense a follow-up report to see what the responses of the various departments had been. It is very disturbing to read that in this report, report No. 41, the response from many of the departments to the recommendations and concerns raised in the earlier report on credit cards was not particularly good. In fact, the Auditor-General flags that the response was in many cases not satisfactory at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading through this report and seeing the misuse which has been made of the Australian government credit card will do little to raise the esteem of public servants. That is a pity because I think the Auditor-General is very careful in his report to point out that it is a small sample and the misuse often related to minor items. Nonetheless, it is fairly clear that the sorts of findings of this report will receive press coverage and in some papers possibly extensive press coverage in the coming days as a result of what the report has revealed and what it has exposed as the misuse of the Australian government credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, just to bring a number of issues to the attention of the Senate, I refer to case study No. 2 on page 12 of the document. It points out that the Australian government credit card was used to purchase sunglasses to the value of $3,600 and wristwatches to the value of $4,590 for issue to staff. In trying to trace what precisely happened in this area, not only was it not possible to find the actual papers&mdash;the audit trail, so to speak&mdash;which documented the purchase, but it is still not possible to actually locate what has happened to the sunglasses and the watches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broad ambit of public affairs these are expenditures in the order of $8,000 but, nonetheless, I think the public would be concerned that the Australian government credit card is being used in this way. The fact is that the people involved have not bothered to keep proper papers nor can they find out precisely what has happened to the watches and sunglasses. In relation to case study No. 3, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included within those transactions referred to Department A on 10 November 1993 was a transaction with a retailer of ladies lingerie and sleep wear. The transaction occurred on 6 April 1993.</PARA>

For example, he points out that the transaction was not queried nor apparently investigated by department A until the Auditor-General raised the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we go through the report we find other examples. In case study No. 4, for example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior staff&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referred to as Mr Green, Mr Black, Mr White, Mr Brown and Ms Grey&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . of a Sydney-based organisation were attending the Senate Estimates Hearings in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Brown approved movement requisitions for Mr Black and Ms Grey both of whom were officers senior to Mr Brown. Mr Black and Ms Grey were paid travelling allowance including components for meals and accommodation at $170 per night, which exceeded their entitlement of $84 per night. At the time of the audit no justification for the excess allowance was provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Grey approved Mr White's and Mr Brown's movement requisitions. Mr White and Mr Brown were paid travelling allowance including components for accommodation and meals.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on, but what we find is that those officers were not called to appear before the estimates committee until quite late in the evening and they, having already been paid a travelling allowance which included a component for the evening meal, doubled-dipped. They had the allowances paid to them but then they were able to use their credit card to purchase a meal. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agency has advised the ANAO that it was necessary for all officers to stay in a five star hotel in close proximity to Parliament House and that agreement to stay at the hotel had been decided at an earlier agency executive meeting. This decision was not recorded.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in other words, they received a travelling allowance like we, as parliamentarians, do. It seems to me that it was approximately the same sum of money. Nonetheless, having been paid that travelling allowance, they were then required, apparently as a result of an agency decision, to stay at a five-star hotel. If we go through the report we find there is case study after case study, and I am sure my colleagues will raise them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to case study No. 9 where an annual branch conference had a theme of continuous improvement and, as an integral part of the conference, gave golf coaching for 30 people, and that was paid for on the Australian government credit card. The branch conference was organised to assist managers to achieve a workable balance between work, family and health and to present techniques to achieve results on a daily basis. The point of the golf lesson activity was to emphasise the place of recreation and health and to demonstrate to managers their capacity to learn a new skill. The taxpayer does not believe that he should be paying for golf lessons for public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important report and it will attract quite a degree of public attention. Although it refers to a very small example, there is no doubt that many people who follow the strictest procedures and requirements will be the subject of jokes at parties and in cartoons in newspapers, and that will not help to improve the standing of the Public Service. That is a pity. The obvious waste of money is of great concern. It appears that the Auditor-General has raised these concerns before and has drawn these particular matters to the attention of government departments. Regrettably, it appears that in some government departments and agencies there was not an appropriate response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When report No. 21 of the Auditor-General came down last year I remember the media coverage that was given to it and the responses that were raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that the first audit reported on the four largest users of the Australian government credit card, namely, the Australian Taxation Office, DAS, Defence and CSIRO. The audit disclosed 25 cases of fraud totalling some $400,000 since 1987. After asking for more information from other agencies, the Auditor-General has found some 46 cases of fraud and misuse valued at between $1.8 million and $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested in some of the tables in this report, and particularly that of the potential misuse of the Australian government credit card. When this matter was looked at a second time, the Auditor-General found 91 transactions of a dubious nature and those transactions are listed. Out of those 91 transactions we have 46 proven cases of misuse&mdash;one above $1 million&mdash;totalling some $1.8 million. Of those 46 cases, only seven have resulted in a successful prosecution and two have been unsuccessful. We really have to look at what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until some proper guidelines and the recommendations of the Auditor-General are put in place, the use of the Australian government credit card should cease immediately. No doubt my colleagues will highlight some of these matters, but in his recommendations the Auditor-General says that there are high risks associated with the use of the Australian government credit card for travel. These matters have not been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a case study on page 19 which concerns an agency commercial manager who was considering transferring from Melbourne to Brisbane. In accordance with the manual, that officer was allowed a three-day familiarisation visit to Brisbane, and she decided to take her 10-year-old daughter with her. The managers approved the itinerary, and they also approved the officer and her daughter staying in Queensland for a further two days to visit two major amusement parks on the Gold Coast. The officer was to pay the costs associated with those two days of activities which were unrelated to her familiarisation visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She travelled to Melbourne airport in her private vehicle and valet parked for the five-day duration of her stay in Queensland. She paid her parking bill with the Australian government credit card. She paid for the five nights accommodation, including the two nights spent on the Gold Coast, with the Australian government credit card. She was obviously rorting the system. The finance section incorrectly calculated that she owed $124.51. That is not too bad for someone who has had her car parked for five days in the valet car parking, had two days on the Gold Coast and stayed in five star hotels. The upshot was that she transferred to Perth rather than Brisbane. That is a good indication of what goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General noted that many credit card holders lacked sufficient guidance in relation to the appropriate use of the credit card. An outstanding example of this is the golf lessons. Really and truly, that was a humdinger. I suggest that was an inappropriate use of the credit card. Obviously the guidelines were not heeded. One could also question the matter of refilling drink cabinets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation No.3 the Auditor-General said that the credit card should only be used where it is the most efficient and effective method of payment. The Auditor-General said that general preference should be given to one method of payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to case study No. 10. I raised this matter in December last year in an instance where the Defence Department had purchased containers for $100,000-odd each and paid for them by credit card, thus invoking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of credit card charges when in fact a cheque was going to cost $12.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has raised the same question here. One department had a long-term contract worth many millions of dollars for the supply of staff uniforms. Individual payments were often in excess of $100,000. The contractor himself informed the department that payment by credit card was costing him in excess of $200,000 a year in credit card charges. He negotiated with the department for payment to be made by cheque seven days after the receipt of the invoice, and he also gave the Commonwealth government a 1.5 per cent discount on each payment. This is a fine example of the inappropriateness of guidelines to ensure that departments use credit cards in the most efficient and effective manner to the government's advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation from the Auditor-General concerned the current strategy for detection, investigation, reporting and prosecution. Case study No. 13 concerning Mr W is very interesting. This is an example of what can happen if these things get out of hand. In 1989 a large Commonwealth organisation sought to move from a centralised system of procurement and payment to a decentralised system; in other words, letting the managers manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular manager&mdash;Mr W&mdash;had a great old time with his credit card. At the time of this particular trial of purchasing, he was earning a salary of less than $45,000. The position that he took involved the procurement and distribution of a large range of goods. Judging by the case study, most of the goods ended up in his garage or under his house. He became very efficient in using the procurement system, especially to his own advantage. He moved to another state and into a new position. The upshot was that somebody woke up to what was happening and that happened because Mr W was skiting in the hotel one night, with a few drinks under his belt, and let the cat out of the bag. The information got back to some of his bosses who decided to look into the matter. They went into the stock records which comprised nearly two cubic metres in volume. However, they will never really know how much he got away with. They have assessed it at $39,500 and have collected $29,500. The mind boggles as to what Mr W could have got away with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has been a real hotch-potch. The Auditor-General is to be commended on highlighting these abuses. Use of these cards should cease immediately until some proper provisions can be arrived at. In one case a sum of $3,500 was spent on sunglasses and nearly $5,000 on wristwatches. Many other examples are given in the report involving a tremendous amount of waste. I think that once again we should commend the Auditor-General for bringing to our attention instances of gross misuse of taxpayers' money. I will leave some of the other matters dealt with in the report to be raised by Senator Ferguson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues Senator Kemp and Senator Calvert have covered many of the aspects of the misuse of government credit cards which have been highlighted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Auditor-General's report No. 41 of 1993-94: project audit: the Australian government credit card: some aspects of its use</EMPHASIS>. I wish to congratulate the Auditor-General and his staff on this report. There is one page that is highlighted in large letters that I believe underlines the whole area of misuse of credit cards. In the guidelines issued to some Australian government credit cardholders we see the following in the guidance to the Australian Taxation Office:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You should exercise extreme care in deciding what to spend public funds on. You should constantly be asking yourself `what would a member of the public think about this expenditure?'</PARA>
<PARA>If we go through all the case studies dealt with in the report, I wonder what members of the public would think about some of these items of expenditure, particularly some of those that have already been highlighted by my colleagues Senators Kemp and Calvert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw attention to a couple of matters. For instance, one of the transactions referred to in the report related to a beauty salon. The way in which this came about was quite extraordinary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 11 March 1994 the department advised the ANAO that this transaction related to the purchase of trench grates and frames from an engineering firm. The engineering firm did not have credit card facilities. The wife of the owner of the engineering firm operated the beauty salon, which did accept payment by credit cards. For this reason the payment was processed through the beauty salon and not the engineering firm.</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion of the ANAO on this case was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that the AGCC audit trail is inadequate and incomplete as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. not all auditees provided sufficient explanation of the nature and purpose of the purchase, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. not all AGCC holders were able to provide either some or indeed any of their documents.</PARA>
<PARA>Another important aspect relates to the use of these cards. Section 14 of the finance directions deals with the subject of travel and makes the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure on official travel is expenditure on purchasing a service to the Commonwealth; it is not intended as expenditure on or for the personal benefit of the person undertaking the journey . . . officers incurring or approving travel expenditure are likely to be called upon to publicly defend their decisions. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet audit report No. 21 reported that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . between 23 March and 27 June 1993, 10,658 travel and travel-related AGCC transactions totalling $14.8 million were incurred using the AGCC, including $512,453 expended at 4 1/2 and 5 star hotels.</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of the travel related expenditure observed during the audit included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . hotel accounts involving accommodation costs, restaurant meals, room service, mini-bar, gymnasium, movie hire, laundry and telephone calls; rental of vehicles; parking of vehicles at airports; and fuel.</PARA>
<PARA>An earlier audit on Australian government credit cards indicated that using the AGCC for travel is `particularly risky'. The risks include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . exceeding entitlements, where the AGCC is used to pay for expenses, for example accommodation, which exceed an officer's entitlements; double dipping, involving an officer using the AGCC to pay for expenses for which travelling allowance has been paid; and personal expenses being billed to the AGCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to hospitality, the finance direction lays down the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In exercising control on hospitality, Departmental Secretaries should ensure that any scrutiny of such expenditure is publicly defensible and should have regard to the policy that the provision of hospitality to Commonwealth Officials is not the primary function of publicly funded hospitality.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report makes the point that departments and agencies advised that 12 per cent of the transactions referred to them for review represented expenditure on hospitality. This expenditure included that which was incurred on alcohol and other liquid refreshments; entertaining at restaurants; gifts in connection with overseas visits; and working lunches and dinners for Commonwealth employees. I remind honourable senators of the initial guideline to which I made reference at the beginning of my remarks. Those concerned were asked to consider what a member of the public would think about such expenditure. The report states under the heading of hospitality:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there can be exceptions to the general rule that the provision of hospitality to Commonwealth officials is not the primary function of publicly funded hospitality, for many of these transactions it is difficult to see how the functions advanced the public interest or how the taxpayers benefited.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to raise one or two matters before I conclude. When talking about asset purchases and cash advances, a report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in March 1994 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the AGCC for large capital purchases is inconsistent with the often stated aim of value for money in Government procurement.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I could outline one example of a case where a government credit card was used for cash in an ad hoc fashion. Difficulties can arise in ensuring that any cash surplus is fully and correctly repaid. To give an example, a cardholder was attending a stock sale for the purpose of purchasing a pig. The pig was to be used to test heart monitoring equipment. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon arrival at the sale yards the AGCC holder was informed that payment by credit card would not be accepted&mdash;payment had to be in cash. The AGCC holder was aware that cash withdrawals on the AGCC were not permitted by his agency but, given time constraints, the AGCC holder decided to make a cash withdrawal at the local bank to pay for the pig and pig food. The AGCC holder later had to be requested to repay the unrequired balance of the cash advance.</PARA>
<PARA>That example gives some indication of the amount of abuse that has taken place with the use of these government credit cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the abuse that has taken place, it is important to understand that the excuse often used is that the cardholders were not aware of the provisions governing use of the card. I point out that the internal audit of one department identified numerous transactions which were considered not to be for official purposes. Before being issued with an Australian government credit card, departmental staff complete and sign a form stating, firstly, that they will not use the Australian government credit card or permit it to be used for other than official purposes; and secondly, that they acknowledge that they have read and understood the conditions governing the issue and use of the Australian government corporate card issued in their name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at all the instances cited in this report of abuse and misuse of credit cards, it is obvious that when these cards have been issued people have either ignored or deliberately misinterpreted the conditions governing their use. With all the case studies I have mentioned and those mentioned by my colleagues I come back to my original statement: I wonder what a member of the public would think about the expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about the Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 41 of 1993-94: project audit: the Australian government credit card: some aspects of its use</EMPHASIS>. Much of what I want to say has already been covered by my colleagues but it is worth making the point again that this is not the first time that concern about the use of the Australian government credit card has been brought to the attention of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only six months since the Auditor-General's report No. 21 was tabled and debated in this parliament. That report raised a number of points about the use of the government credit card. One was that, while the credit card was originally intended to be used to pay for minor claims, typically under $1,000, out of the $418 million expended by use of the card in the financial year 1992-93, the audit office estimated that 68 per cent, or $283 million, involved transactions in excess of $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 21 also found that there were many instances where one Commonwealth agency paid another by credit card, thereby incurring a fee for what should have been a simple funds transfer. It found that departments were unable to identify the use to which the credit card was put or the advantages or disadvantages that accrued from different patterns of usage. That report also said that departmental management could not monitor expenditure trends associated with card usage or payment mode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identified purchases of capital items such as speedboats and ancillary parts for missile launchers using the credit card when, as it had pointed out, the card was intended for low risk purposes and did not provide the controls for accountability needed for large purposes. In fact, when that report was tabled last year I had particular amusement in drawing attention to the fact that in 1992-93 $893,000 was spent using the credit card on bomb suits and accessories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 21 found that the credit card is not widely used across the Commonwealth. It found that nine per cent of credit cardholders accounted for 77 per cent of expenditure; that three agencies accounted for 63 per cent of card transactions; and that one department was responsible for 62 per cent of credit card expenditure. Surprisingly, last September the audit office supported the continued appropriate use of the credit card, despite the fact that it also concluded that many of the benefits that it was claimed would flow from the use of the card did not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report received a lot of publicity and was the subject of much debate here. I would have thought that careful account would have been taken of it by the departments and agencies concerned in the intervening period. However, this follow-up report tabled today shows quite clearly that this review has confirmed the findings of the Auditor-General in report No. 21 that the `audit trail was weak'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by the examples cited by my colleagues, this report identifies numerous cases of concern which suggest that no cognisance was taken of the earlier report. In report No. 41 the audit office found: that in a number of transactions the card was used for non-official purposes; that there was evidence of lack of proper approval for purchases; that the card had been used outside guidelines; that DAS common use contracts had not been used; and that sales tax exemption had not been sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into all the details, the important thing is that the Auditor-General has again drawn our attention to this matter. It is of great concern that nothing seems to have been done in the period since the last report. I am concerned, as I am sure the Senate is, about the government's apparent lack of action in this area. This is a matter of public accountability and of demonstrating integrity in the use of taxpayers' money and in accounting for it. If taxpayers and the community at large cannot feel confident in its government and its agencies acting responsibly in the use of public funds, that is a matter of considerable concern. I congratulate the Auditor-General for again bringing this matter to our attention. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take the opportunity to speak briefly about this report; there are some things that need to be said. The committee was required to consider the proposal to erect parking meters in the parliamentary zone&mdash;that is, within the precincts of the parliament&mdash;because, under the provisions of the Parliament Act 1974, any such work needs the approval of the parliament before it can go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the national capital plan, certain things had to be taken into account in dealing with the parliamentary zone. As referred to in the report, those matters include the following: the area is at the heart of the national capital; developments in the area should be sited and designed to support the prominence of the area's national functions and to reinforce the character of the area; it is the home of our most important cultural and judicial institutions and symbols, including Parliament House, and therefore there should be a higher standard of architecture for buildings located in the parliamentary zone. To put you out of your misery, Mr Acting Deputy President, the committee concluded that the proposal to erect parking meters in the parliamentary zone should not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter came to the committee from the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), in his capacity as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services at the time, who has responsibility for the national capital plan. That was in a letter to the chairman of our committee dated 21 December 1993, part of which read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the Parliamentary Zone.</PARA>
<PARA>He then talked about the financial arrangements for it and other matters. So that was the proposal for the inquiry that we embarked upon, and in regard to which we called for submissions. Very late in the proceedings one of the members of the committee raised the question of whether we were merely to look at the installation of parking meters or the proposal as a whole. That matter is referred to in the report; there is a dissenting report relating to the interpretation of the minister's request. I personally disagree with that interpretation but, of course, respect the right of the member to come to the conclusion to which he has come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter having been brought to the minister's attention, the minister then wrote a letter dated 1 June 1994 in which he attempted to restrict the inquiry just to the visual impact of the parking meters. If honourable senators read his first letter to the chairman, they may well come to the conclusion to which I and other members of the committee came&mdash;that it was the proposal that we were examining. Certainly that was what those who put in submissions seemed to think. The submissions that came to us all dealt with the proposal as a whole and the implications of it, rather than merely looking at the visual impact of the parking meters, vouchers and things of that nature which were to be implemented. We deal with the particulars of those proposals in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came to the conclusion that the permission of the parliament should not be given for this to go ahead. The committee felt that under the proposal revenue targets were not likely to be met. We were not convinced, on the evidence given to us, that the proposal would meet its objectives. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the reason for it was to upgrade the parliamentary zone. None of us would deny that over recent years the quality of the parliamentary zone has declined; there is no question about that. It is my view that it is an area of such national importance that it ought to be properly maintained out of the budget and not by trying to get money from those who work in the area by way of parking meters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also found that there was no guarantee that once the zone had been improved the charges would cease. I am sure that anyone hearing that suggestion would laugh at the idea&mdash;that, having installed parking meters, once the objective had been met they would no longer be used. We felt that insufficient attention had been paid to the impact on tourism in the area&mdash;the impact on Australians coming here to look at the historic and important national assets in the parliamentary zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt there was no guarantee there would be improved public transport links within the zone at peak periods, as that would be an additional cost to the ACT government, and that insufficient attention had been paid to the nature of the zone as an important employer of people in the ACT. We certainly felt that the parking vouchers would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the matter of bus links and the impact on employees in the zone. Employees in the zone who complain about the impact are not just whingeing about having to pay for parking. There is inadequate public transport in the area. There are no shops or other facilities. People may say there is paid parking in the vicinity of areas in Civic and other spots like Woden where public servants work. But in those areas there are shops and facilities so that people can conduct business during their lunch hour without using a motor vehicle, which is not the case in the parliamentary triangle. In order for people to conduct their normal business activities and to make some use of their lunchtime, they would need to have a car, or stay in their place of employment or, on a nice day, perhaps walk to the lake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also significant that we are discussing this matter at 5.25 p.m. Honourable senators would know if they went outside that it is now dark and has been so for about half an hour, which means that everybody going home from the area is going home in the dark at this time of the year. It was not unreasonable that the Public Service submission referred in particular to the effect on women workers in the area and of their having to catch buses from these places, especially on dark winter nights, at the end of the day. I invite honourable senators to look at the submissions which refer to the impact on employees in the area. As I said, it is not just a question of money. I think it was suggested that it would cost $2 a day to park at this stage. We also heard a suggestion that it should go up to about $6 a day, which would have a pretty significant impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us were particularly concerned about the fact that the major institutions in the area&mdash;the old Parliament House, the High Court, the National Gallery and certainly the National Science and Technology Centre&mdash;employ volunteers who give of their time to show people around. We had correspondence from two sections of the tax office about this matter. In the end, we were given a letter that could be interpreted to mean that there would be no fringe benefits tax paid in relation to parking by volunteers in the area. I think that whole matter is unresolved and unclear. They referred only to the impact on the National Science and Technology Centre, not to the impact on other institutions, which would be significant. It would have an enormous impact on the volunteers if they were required to pay for parking while they were giving of their time at these institutions. Many of them could not possibly afford to pay that amount of money. To suggest they should do so while they are working as volunteers is totally unacceptable. The impact on the volunteers and the unsatisfactory situation with regard to the fringe benefits tax are referred to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time that we were conducting this inquiry, the other thing that occurred that I found quite extraordinary was that we were looking to make a recommendation to the parliament as to whether or not the proposal should go ahead. During that time the minister promulgated an ordinance giving himself the power to impose the fees which would be charged once the parking meters had been installed. I have given notice to disallow that ordinance. We will, of course, talk to the minister about it. I think the minister owes the parliament an explanation as to why he would do such a thing while the matter was before a parliamentary committee. I am very disappointed, at the very least, that he should do so. Also, I think the ordinance was defective in that it did not allow for the parliament to scrutinise the fee that he would choose from time to time and make it subject to disallowance by the parliament. But that is a matter we may debate on another day when my disallowance motion comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons I have briefly referred to, the majority of the committee came to the view that the proposal to install paid parking voucher machines or meters in the parliamentary triangle should not go ahead. Even last Saturday, you may have seen, Mr Acting Deputy President, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> a number of proposals for upgrading and developing the parliamentary zone over a number of years. Of course, it is only right and proper that it should be looked at on an ongoing basis with a view to changing it, varying it or upgrading it from time to time. It seems absurd to be doing that at the same time as the place is being covered with parking meters. I have no hesitation in saying that the Senate should not approve the proposal to install parking meters in the parliamentary triangle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston thought differently and he can respond to my comments if he wishes. The issues themselves are adequately dealt with in the report and in Senator Reid's tabling statement, so I will not go over that ground again except to indicate that I support the recommendations. However, given the comments made in Senator Colston's dissenting report, I need to deal with that and defend the committee from the accusation that it exceeded its terms of reference and that its report should be of no effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pages 5 and 6 of the report deal with the disagreement within the committee about the extent of the terms of reference. Senator Colston's dissent on pages 28 and 29 states that at no time had he considered that the committee's reference required it to consider the actual decision to introduce pay parking in the parliamentary zone. He goes on to say that he believed it was not the government's decision which was under review and points out that, when it became apparent that the other members of the committee disagreed with this interpretation, he wrote to the chair asking him to seek clarification from the minister and that occurred. The dissenting report says that, because the committee went beyond its terms of reference, its report should be of no effect. I need to put some balance in that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submissions were received during February and March. All of the submissions dealt with the policy issue, not the simpler issue of the design of the parking machines and signs. The public hearing was held on 7 April and the NCPA, in its primary presentation, dealt with the policy issues. It also responded to those submissions objecting to the proposal. The NCPA did not suggest that the concentration on those matters was beyond the intended terms of reference. It is fair to assume that, if the NCPA thought that, it would have advised the minister and made him aware of the nature of the submissions and he could have corrected the misunderstanding, if there was one, at the time, but he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Colston was present during the hearing. As I said, the NCPA did not raise the matter. Senator Colston did not suggest at the time that the committee was dealing with the wrong issues or that the submissions were beyond the terms of reference. He himself asked questions on the wider matter. Then we had the chair's draft report distributed on 6 May. It was only after that that Senator Colston suggested that he disagreed with the nature of the draft and the fact that it extended to the basic issues of the policy behind the matter rather than just the signs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is that, if there was an ambiguity that needed to be settled, it could and should have been settled much earlier by the minister&mdash;perhaps at the time that the submissions were approved for publication by the committee. Even if the minister had then made clear that a more restricted inquiry had been intended, what probably would have happened&mdash;although this is a matter of judgment&mdash;was that the majority in the Senate would have extended or clarified the terms of reference to cover the wider issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, it was reasonable of the committee to interpret the reference as being of the whole proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has previously been routinely informed of many proposed minor works in the parliamentary zone involving signage. These have been mainly for information or with a request simply to see whether there was any objection from the committee and there has been none. To the extent that this was about signage only, it was different only in a matter of degree as to its impact. My assessment is that this matter was quite different in that it was a formal reference from the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was reasonable to assume that all the issues were to be examined, as the Standing Committee on Public Works does when a proposed building project is referred to it. The public works committee does not just examine the architecture but also the justification for and desirability of the project. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories was in a similar position with this reference. I just wanted to put in that defence of the position that I took on the matter and say that I believe that the report should stand, it is in order, and the committee acted correctly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue arose from a decision made during the budget processes in 1993 that the parliamentary zone be refurbished by spending $19.3 million and that part of that expenditure, $4.3 million, be offset by money raised through the establishment of a pay parking system throughout the parliamentary zone. In a letter written by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, on 21 December 1993, the committee was asked to examine a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority to install new parking signs and new voucher machines in the parliamentary zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told in the report that the committee accepted the reference and wrote to all major departments and institutions located in and around the zone requesting comment on the proposal. In addition, advertisements were placed in the Canberra and surrounding area press calling for submissions. A total of 35 submissions was received. As far as the committee was concerned, the evidence received was conclusive and almost unanimous that the proposal was ridiculous, ill-advised, unfair and even financially illogical. To avoid treating and examining this matter in a cavalier fashion, the committee adopted a rigorous and extensive program of hearing the evidence. We are told at paragraph 2.15 of the report, on page 6:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To those parties expressing interest in the Committee's inquiry were sent copies of the reference and the Works Proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>To support what Senator Coates has just said, it continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without exception, all persons and organisations making submissions to the inquiry addressed the broader range of issues raised in the NCPA's proposal, rather than focussing on the installation of equipment and signs.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the report states at paragraph 2.16:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCPA itself, in its initial presentation of the proposal to the Committee and in evidence at the public hearing, directed the Committee's attention to a broader range of issues than simply the installation of machines&mdash;although this latter issue was certainly covered.</PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 2.16 we are also told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCPA sought to respond to the various issues raised about the proposal and certainly made no suggestion to the Committee that it was inappropriate for those issues to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA>We examined the proposal&mdash;not the aesthetics of the proposal, the planning issues or even the mechanics of the proposal, but the proposal&mdash;and eventually found, as I originally stated, that it was ridiculous, ill-advised, unfair and even financially illogical. I use the word `ridiculous' because there was considerable agreement from the evidence given and by the committee's findings that the parliamentary zone is an area where the highest standards of architecture will be sought for buildings and the installation of numerous additional signs and 31 voucher machines cannot enhance the overall appearance of the area. We are told on page 7 of the report at paragraph 3.5 that the committee believes that such things would detract significantly from the zone. The word `ridiculous' is my term but I think it is a suitable term when we consider how much attention is given to the aesthetics of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;perhaps it is of particular interest to you knowing the sorts of things that you spend time investigating&mdash;that in an area where we employ people to operate mechanical wind brooms which blow three or four leaves from one side of a path to another and an area where we are so concerned about aesthetics that people patrol the precincts of this Parliament House engaged in such alterations and such attention to aesthetics, if that is what we think it is appropriate to do, surely we should question the appropriateness of cluttering up these aesthetics with such frightening things as parking voucher machines. I do not think there is anybody in the nation who thinks that they are exciting and lovely things to be casting one's gaze upon. I think they are offensive to most people not because of their particular size, shape and description but because of their function, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the proposal is ill-advised because the advice that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services gave in the origin of this proposal was that $4.3 million of the refurbishment funds were to be offset by the generation of revenue, primarily through the implementation of pay parking on national land. I would suggest that is not good advice because the capacity of the national assets to raise money is greater than the capacity to raise money through the parking taxes which would have been placed upon employees in this zone. The committee believes, with good reason, and states at paragraph 3.9, on page 8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the NCPA should investigate other possible sources of income that could be derived from National Capital assets, rather than to simply accept what appears to be, at least superficially, the easiest and most lucrative means by which revenue can be raised. Areas for possible consideration could include charging rental for the land in the Parliamentary Zone (Australian Estate Management charges rent for the properties, but does not in turn pay land rent to the NCPA) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We thought that that would be an initial step to return funds to the NCPA if that were required. It is suggested that it is required for the refurbishment. That could have been an initial step. The report states that other steps could have included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . instituting charges for the commercial use of land and facilities in the Central National Area (which the NCPA is unable to do at the moment because of legislative restrictions); photographic and film rights; and possible joint ventures and other commercial development opportunities including recreational facilities. These options would result in a spread of the obligation of "user-pays", beyond just simply employees in the Zone.</PARA>
<PARA>That it was directly the employees of this area who were being targeted is a large part of the contention that labelled this proposal as unfair. I will deal with that in a second and will quote part of the findings to demonstrate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that various submissions made to the committee raised the question of whether it was appropriate that a substantial proportion of the maintenance of a national asset, the construction of which had been paid for by the taxpayers as a whole, should fall on a small group of people, namely those who work in the zone. We are told in paragraph 3.10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade argued that it was strongly of the view "that the cost of maintaining the National Area is a national responsibility and not one that should fall on those who are obliged to work there." Another submission argued that "the proposal will do no more than shift rightful financial responsibility for the upkeep of a national asset from the Commonwealth Government to the unfortunate people who must use the car park daily . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A further demonstration of the unfairness is that part of the proposal, as the NCPA tells us&mdash;we quote this as a committee at paragraph 3.19 on page 11&mdash;`on weekends and public holidays, when visitor demands are greatest, no charges or time limited controls will apply' in the zone. So the proposal was an unfair proposal. It was targeting certain people but not others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest also&mdash;this is my terminology but I think the evidence in the report substantiates it&mdash;that this proposal is financially illogical because we have a proposal which would initially cost $234,600. The operating costs would be $2.677 million a year, comprising $1.156 million operating costs, $0.435 million management costs, a $390,000 bus subsidy and a $696,000 risk estimate. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President, your quick mind has added those figures up to find that something like $3 million is to be spent to raise $4.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that $4.3 million is raised, the additional qualification that must be put on it is that a considerable amount of that $4.3 million would be raised from within the government sources itself. In fact, it was estimated that some $600,000 would be raised from Parliament House, not from the employees but from the Department of the Senate and the Department of the House of Representatives. That $600,000 would merely go in a circle back to some other part of government. So here we have a demonstration of the financial illogicality by the fact that it would cost almost $3 million to run&mdash;that even if $4.3 million were raised, a vast proportion of that would be raised from within government coffers to be circulated somewhere else into government coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NCPA submission also demonstrates the lack of planning and forethought that has gone into this proposal. The NCPA was asked what would happen to any funds raised in excess of the target of $4.3 million. The response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use of funds beyond 1996-97 has not been determined. The restoration program was due to run for four years. </PARA>
<PARA>I bet the parking voucher machines would not come down after four years; I bet they would stay there. The question was asked, `What would happen to the whole program after that?' There was no answer. There was then this response from the NCPA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration of funds allocated, or indeed retention by the NCPA, closer to that date will include the extent of the restoration program which remains unfinished, subject to parliamentary approval; the extent to which the proposed central national area plan requires surface car parks in the parliamentary zone; and parliamentary approval in the budget context to expend additional income on restoration works or otherwise return additional funds to consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that had not been addressed beyond 1996-97. If this was a proposal to raise $4.3 million to contribute to the $19.3 million restoration program, then it was a proposal which had consequences and effects&mdash;that is a tautology, but that is what I mean&mdash;beyond 1996-97. I doubt that those who cooked up this proposal had considered what those effects might be. Therefore, I submit that it was a silly proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the eventual recommendation of the committee was that it not proceed. The only good thing that I can determine about this proposal is that it was not a bad sort of job creation system. I think those senators who have not gone into this and who have tried to evaluate it on the surface might be absolutely thrilled to know that the circulation of $3 million or $4 million from one government department to another would result in a staff requirement of five. So as a job creation program involving $3 million or $4 million, five people would be employed, and that is about the best that could be said about it. I do not think that all that fuss and bother is worth it, as a job creation program, I cannot see any other point to it. In conclusion, I am pleased to endorse the recommendation of the committee which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that Parliamentary approval, as required under Section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, not be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the Parliamentary Zone.</PARA>

<PARA>The committee's current inquiry arose when the then Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services referred a matter to the committee in a letter dated 21 December 1993. The minister's letter is attached to the report at appendix A, the first paragraph of which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the Parliamentary Zone.</PARA>
<PARA>It had always been my interpretation of the minister's reference that the committee was required to consider the National Capital Planning Authority's proposal to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the parliamentary zone. I came to this conclusion because the minister's letter explicitly stated that he was referring to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the Parliamentary Zone.</PARA>
<PARA>I had at no time considered that the committee's reference required it to consider the actual decision to introduce pay parking in the parliamentary zone. Rather, I considered the decision to implement pay parking was a government decision as outlined in the 1993-94 budget. In this regard, the minister's letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's 1993-94 Budget provided for $19.3 million over four years for a new Restoration and Replacement Program for Commonwealth Assets in the National Capital to be administered by the National Capital Planning Authority. Of this, $4.3 million is to be offset by the generation of revenue, primarily through the implementation of pay parking on National Land.</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore considered that the proposal to implement pay parking as a government budget decision was the background against which it was proposed to install parking signs and voucher machines. I did not consider it was the government's decision which was under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it became apparent to me that other members of the committee disagreed with this interpretation, I wrote to the chairman asking him to seek clarification from the minister. The chairman acceded to my request and the minister subsequently responded. The correspondence in relation to this matter is attached to the report. In part, the minister's letter read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reference related to the installation of new parking signs and voucher machines within the Parliamentary Zone, that is to the actual mechanics for pay parking, not to the wider issue of the introduction of paid parking, which has been dealt with through the Budget process.</PARA>
<PARA>That advice confirmed my views but it was not heeded by other members of the committee. Because it was not, the committee went beyond its terms of reference. The committee is not empowered to determine its own references, as it apparently has done on this occasion, and therefore the report should be of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the discussion about voucher machines and signs, the issues raised in chapter 3 of the report are consequent on an investigation into the wider matter of the introduction of pay parking. These issues include revenue generation, revenue estimates, who should pay for parking facilities, fringe benefits tax, alternative modes of transport, volunteer workers, facilities in the zone, effects on tourism and the impact on surrounding areas. These are not germane to what the committee was asked to investigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government had made its decision to introduce pay parking in the parliamentary zone, voucher machines and signage were a natural consequence of that decision. I do not agree with the committee's statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the erection of the voucher machines and accompanying signage would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the Parliamentary Zone, and would be contrary to the high design standards enforced by the NCPA for other works in the area.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee's statement begs the question of how the government's decision could be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that parliamentary approval, as required under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the parliamentary zone. I wish to stress that I enjoy working on this committee and have good personal relations with each other member of the committee. I thus regret having to make a dissenting report. Nevertheless, I would not be fulfilling my commitment to the committee and to the parliament if I failed to outline my concern in a dissenting report. </PARA>

<PARA>The report which I have just tabled refers to the proposed construction of an Australian embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The proposal includes a new chancery, head of mission residence, staff apartments and recreational facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $23.605 million at March 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Australian Embassy in Hanoi consists of a two-storey French style villa used as the chancery, adjoining villas on either side and a purpose-built block of staff apartments. There is also a swimming pool and a recreation area. One of the two adjoining villas is the ambassador's residence and the other contains staff apartments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chancery was first occupied in 1978 and the two adjoining buildings were occupied in 1991 after extensive renovations. Although the chancery building has been extensively renovated by Australian tradesmen and completely rewired, maintenance of the building remains a constant problem. The chancery is unfortunately already too small for current requirements and will be converted into a senior staff apartment as part of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Overseas Property Group has accorded the Hanoi project a high priority among proposed capital works projects because of the inadequacy of both the office and residential accommodation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade endorses the construction of the new custom-built chancery and official residence as it believes it will make an invaluable contribution to promoting Australia's identity in Vietnam and will demonstrate Australia's firm commitment to developing a substantial long-term relationship with Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lifting of the United States economic and trade embargos against Vietnam has opened the way for the resumption of lending to that country by the international financial institutions and major bilateral donors such as Japan. These developments will stimulate economic growth in Vietnam, and this will bring increasing commercial opportunities for Australian companies. This will place increasing demands on the Australian Embassy in Hanoi which is already operating at what can only be described as beyond full stretch in servicing the current level of relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to a new chancery and official residence, it is proposed to construct a four-storey apartment block. The existing staff accommodation is below standard and there is a lack of appropriate alternative accommodation available on the open market. Where residential accommodation is obtainable, extensive refurbishment is required. However, refurbishment costs are high and even the best accommodation may still be substandard after refurbishment has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction of well-built accommodation within the chancery compound will enhance the physical security of staff while also providing for emergency power and filtered water supplies. There will also be significant savings in the long term to the Commonwealth resulting from rental savings and lower maintenance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hanoi has few recreational facilities available for staff. There are no clubs and there are very few sporting facilities of a suitable standard for casual hire. The present chancery compound has a small recreational area with a swimming pool. The recreational facilities in the new complex will include a tennis court, swimming pool and squash court. The committee is satisfied that these facilities are fully justified in Hanoi which the committee was advised is an extremely difficult living and working environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site for the complex is located in an area of Hanoi which is being developed as a diplomatic enclave and already accommodates a number of diplomatic missions and their associated residential apartments. The committee was initially somewhat startled to discover that the site is currently part of a small freshwater lake, as indeed are all non-developed sites in this area. The site which will be reclaimed has an area of some 1.17 hectares and will be leased from the Vietnamese government for a period of 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that the construction of the embassy complex on reclaimed land would not present difficulties. The OPG advised the committee that it believed that the site would be suitable although further geotechnical advice would be sought and there would be a cost loading in terms of the extensive piling system required. While OPG advised the committee that the presence of unexploded ordnance on the site was not expected the committee however has recommended that a metal detector survey of the site should be undertaken before construction commences as a precaution against the possible presence of unexploded ordnance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee welcomes the construction of this project, it is fair to say that the committee is somewhat disappointed with the design of the complex. The committee was advised by OPG that in large measure, the design was influenced by the characteristics of the local building industry in Hanoi which has a combination of comparatively cheap and unskilled labour with a high work ethic. The industry is labour intensive, with minimal mechanical equipment being available, therefore all proposed embassy buildings will be simple in form and structure to make allowances for the local building industry both in relation to short-term construction requirements and longer term maintenance factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve the necessary building quality it will be essential that expatriate trade and specialist services supervision form part of the construction program. All imported materials will come through the port of Haiphong, which could become an area of delay to the project as trade activity increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee understands and accepts the practical constraints which lead to the design solution for the Hanoi complex, it does not believe that the design reflects the positive and dynamic image which Australia should be projecting in Asia. The committee is of the view that OPG could hold a design competition when a project of this nature is being developed in future. The committee believes that OPG does not have an underlying design philosophy which would enable its architectural consultants to express a sense of an Australian identity in building projects. The committee has recommended that OPG should develop such an underlying design philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following recent construction experience in Beijing, Jakarta and Pnom Penh, and in order to achieve the desired project quality, it is envisaged that a considerable number of Australian trade and specialist supervisory personnel will be employed during the construction phase. The successful contractor will be required to specify and use Australian products wherever possible. Australian manufactured furniture will be used throughout all buildings. OPG expects that the material components will be 80 per cent Australian content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the total cost of the project is $23.605 million. However, it is interesting to note that there will be no impact on the budget as funds will be made available from the sale of properties in Singapore. OPG advised the committee that the sale of the properties in Singapore will also finance the construction of a chancery in Islamabad, refurbishment of Australia House in London, the purchase of land for housing in Shanghai and also the construction of a modern residence for the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the difficulties likely to be experienced in construction of the project, the committee sought an assurance from OPG that the cost of the project would not rise significantly as had been the case in Beijing. OPG stated that unlike the Beijing project, an Australian project manager would be appointed with OPG taking control of the project from the initial stages. In Beijing OPG was tied to a Chinese construction company and also did not have direct control of the project. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth parliamentary conference was attended by 247 delegates from 97 Commonwealth jurisdictions. Its theme was:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the strengthening of parliamentary democracy</PARA>

The full text of his address is an appendix to the report I have just presented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CPA's formal decision making body, the general assembly, was especially significant in that it adopted a new constitution. The former constitution had been in effect since 1977 and had been much amended, leading to problems of interpretation and questions as to its consistency. The Commonwealth of Australia branch, and particularly former President Kerry Sibraa, had put considerable effort into the development of the draft. Our delegation was successful in persuading the general assembly to agree to certain amendments to the proposed constitution. The adoption of the constitution, as amended, was received with utmost satisfaction by all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assembly also elected the next chairman of the CPA executive committee. Mr Colin Shepherd, a member of the UK House of Commons, was successful and congratulations are extended to him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation's visit to Malta was the first official visit by a delegation from the Australian parliament. Australia's relations with Malta at the parliamentary, governmental and citizen levels remain excellent, enhanced somewhat by the large numbers in Australia of Maltese-born citizens and those claiming Maltese ancestry. Discussions were held with the Maltese president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, the leader of the opposition, central political party representatives and leading figures in industry and commerce. The end result from the delegation's view was a most successful renewal of ties with the Maltese House of Representatives and review of our bilateral relationship, and an exchange of views on a wide range of political, economic and social issues, both domestic and international.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit to Germany was the first by a parliamentary delegation since the 1989 unification. The timing was interesting in that the commencement of the visit coincided with the Hamburg state elections in what was described by one participant in the delegation's program as a marathon period of elections. In Hamburg the social democratic party lost its absolute majority but retained power with the support of the greens. The Christian democratic union vote fell to 25 per cent and a right wing extremist candidate failed to be elected only by 0.2 per cent. Some observers saw the result as a protest vote against the major parties and a major shift in politics resulting from changes in eastern Europe, and as an indication of Germany in microcosm. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contact the delegation enjoyed with a wide cross-section of political, legislative, and executive leaders, with leading industry and commerce figures, and in legislator to legislator discussions, gave the delegation a sound awareness of the challenges and practical considerations flowing from the 1989 unification, particularly the enormous resources required to bring the former GDR states to parity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit provided members of the delegation with the opportunity to advance strongly the australian position on the need for a speedy conclusion to the Uruguay Round and to assert our support for the Blair House agreement as a minimum position. The opportunity was also taken to urge greater access to Australian exports, particularly coal and agricultural products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation had the opportunity to sample some of Germany's cultural delights, including a German performance of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Phantom of the Opera</EMPHASIS> in Hamburg, a modernistic performance in the Semper Opera House, Dresden, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hommage a Rachmaninoff</EMPHASIS>, and a tour of the `Old Masters Gallery' in Dresden, encompassing works by Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck and others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thanks are extended to our hosts and to the Australian representatives in Cyprus, Malta and Germany. Australia is well served by the calibre of our representatives. The hard working staff of the parliamentary relations office as ever did everything within their power to ensure the visits success. Thanks are also extended to the delegation members. It was an extremely hard-working delegation, punctual and ever-committed to presenting a unified representation of Australia's position on specific issues.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just presented&mdash;ASIO and Security Assessment: a Review of Security Assessment Procedures&mdash;is the result of a reference to the Committee from the previous Attorney-General in the last Parliament, which was referred again by the present Attorney-General in May 1993. In total, five public hearings were held, two in 1992 and three in 1993. Submissions were received from twenty-nine organisations and individuals, and evidence was taken at both public and in-camera hearings from agencies such as ASIO itself, the Attorney-General's Department, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Review Council, the Privacy Commissioner and the Merit Protection and Review Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report traces briefly the historical background to ASIO's present role in security assessment; from its establishment in 1949, through the Royal Commissions headed by Mr Justice Hope in the 1970s and the 1980s to the present. In its examination of the issues, the committee came to several early and fundamental conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">firstly, that it remains in the national interest to restrict access to certain places and information; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, that the appropriate balance has been achieved between the security assessment role of ASIO and the access suitability decision-making role of agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching these conclusions, however, the committee identified a number of areas of concern:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the intrusive nature of security checking, and the extent to which this process itself may deter suitable applicants for positions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent of security checking, resulting from the number of government positions requiring the occupants to have a national security clearance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the qualifications, training and experience of agency officers involved in security clearance decisions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">aspects of the procedures adopted by the Security Appeals Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the lack of a right of review of agency decisions in relation to access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee makes nine recommendations in relation to these concerns. Among these are recommendations designed to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow for greater public accountability by agency heads for decisions related to security access;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">review the privacy-intrusive nature of the present process; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establish a new security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and permit appeals to the Tribunal in relation to access decisions by agency heads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report makes an important contribution to what should be a continuing examination and discussion of the sensitive issues involved in personnel security. This continuing examination must always seek to balance individual human rights with the needs of national security. I thank committee members for their contribution, and also the staff, particularly Don Nairn, Pat Sherman and Laura Gillies and, in the later stages of the inquiry, Peter Gibson, Catherine Cornish, Margaret Gibson and Sophia Konti.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes a number of amendments to improve the operation of the Corporations Law and to facilitate the operations of the Australian Securities Commission ("ASC") and the Corporations and Securities Panel ("the Panel").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General, the Hon Michael Lavarch, foreshadowed this legislation last year in introducing the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993. At that time, and in the debate on that bill earlier this year, the Attorney-General also referred to the major long term process that has been established to simplify the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government is pleased to report that good progress is being made with simplification, that process will take time. In the meantime, the current law governs the corporate sector and some reform must continue to keep that law in tune with the rapidly changing commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When deficiencies are revealed they need to be rectified. When new products, services and structures challenge the boundaries of the law, those boundaries have to be moved. That is why this bill is brought forward at this time. These amendments cannot wait for their turn for simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public exposure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is the usual practice in relation to corporate legislation, this bill, or more accurately, most of this bill, was released for public comment in December 1993. The period of public exposure ended on 28 February 1994 and public submissions made during that period have been taken into account in finalising the bill for introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have qualified my comment on the extent of the bill's public exposure as there is one important proposal that was not, in fact, included in the exposure draft of the bill, but which has arisen subsequently and has been included in the bill prior to its introduction. The proposal in question is that to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts maintained by futures brokers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a second proposal in the bill, as introduced, that did not appear in the exposure draft of the bill&mdash;namely the proposal to enable trading on stock and futures markets of new products which do not fall squarely within the current definitions of "securities" or a "futures contract". However, I wish to inform the Senate that the Government will not be proceeding with this proposal at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the definitions of "securities" and "futures contract" were intended to enable trading on stock and futures markets of certain new hybrid products. In particular, they were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange from 1 July 1994. The Government has now been informed that the Exchange will not be ready to trade this product until later in the year. In light of that it is preferable that the amendments have further exposure and to this end the bill has been amended in the House to omit this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the public exposure process the Attorney-General's Department is to develop the proposed regulations that would govern the trading of these new products as a matter of priority. This will clarify the situation and provide adequate information for a more detailed consideration of the policy underlying the proposed amendments. It is the Government's intention, at this stage, to introduce a separate bill containing amendments following that exposure period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Content of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now mention a few of the most important amendments proposed by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conferral of jurisdiction on lower courts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most important reforms is the conferral of civil jurisdiction on lower courts (such as magistrates courts and district courts) to hear small civil claims arising under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal has been developed in response to concerns from the business community and the legal profession about court judgments over the last year which have held that civil jurisdiction under the Corporations Law is confined to superior courts (ie, the Federal Court, the Family Courts and the Supreme Court in each State and Territory). Concern has been expressed that legitimate civil actions will not be able to be brought under the Corporations Law because of the cost and delay involved in bringing actions before the superior courts. For very small claims, it will often be that the cost of the filing fees alone would prevent the commencement of civil proceedings in a superior court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to the principle that justice should be available to the community at an affordable cost and with the prospect of a speedy resolution. It is for this reason that it has moved to amend the corporations legislation to confer civil jurisdiction on lower courts in regard to those civil actions under the Corporations Law which are in the nature of debt recovery, monetary compensation or minor administrative remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative framework for the national scheme of corporate regulation means that effective jurisdiction can only be conferred on lower courts if complementary amendments are made by State and Northern Territory Governments to the Corporations Acts of the respective jurisdictions. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has already agreed that the necessary amendments should be made as soon as possible and the Government anticipates that a uniform date can be set for the operation of these amendments in each jurisdiction in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are expected to receive widespread support from the business community given that they will reduce the cost and delays associated with bringing small civil actions under the Corporations Law. It is important that these reforms be implemented as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearing house electronic subregister system ("CHESS")</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also proposes a number of amendments to support the introduction of the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (commonly known as "CHESS") to be introduced by the Australian Stock Exchange. CHESS will bring the settlement procedures of the Stock Exchange to world best standards. The aim of CHESS is to have transactions settled and delivered within 3 days after trade and to replace the current paper document of transfer with electronic transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic legislative framework for CHESS was established by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992. Since the passage of that Act, and in progressing the CHESS project to its final stages of development, the Stock Exchange has sought a number of additional amendments to the legislative framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are basically refinements of the existing legislative scheme. They are essential to the smooth operation of CHESS. They deal with such matters as the cancellation of certificates by brokers; electronic acceptances; off market transfers before official quotation and establishment of record dates to determine entitlement to vote and receipt of dividends and other benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Stock Exchange presently envisages that CHESS will commence operation in September this year. In view of this imminent start-up date, it is important that these amendments proceed as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Application of the Corporations Law to financial institutions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important set of amendments proposed by the bill are the provisions dealing with the application of the Corporations Law to non-bank financial institutions (the collective term for such bodies as building societies and credit unions).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of the uniform Financial Institutions Code by the States and Territories in 1992 has highlighted the uneven and inconsistent application of the Corporations Law and State and Territory legislation to the activities of financial institutions. The resolution of the interface between the Corporations Law and State and Territory legislation was a matter left for future consideration at the time the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory entered into the Heads of Agreement on Future Corporate Regulation in June 1990. This has resulted in doubts and uncertainties for financial institutions as to which law applies to their activities, as well as a degree of regulatory and administrative duplication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Ministerial Council for Corporations and the Ministerial Council for Financial Institutions agreed to principles on which the interface between the two bodies of law could be rationalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key aspect of this resolution was agreement that the fundraising activities of financial institutions, in their state of incorporation or elsewhere, should be governed by the Corporations Law. This reflects the Commonwealth's policy that there is significant public benefit in there being a single regulator and uniform regulation of public fundraising in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other areas, such as the duties of officers and charges over the property of financial institutions, the Corporations Law will be displaced by the Financial Institutions Code as that is considered a more appropriate form of regulation for these bodies in those areas. In addition, the registration of financial institutions under the Corporations Law as registrable Australian bodies will no longer be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments, together with complementary amendments to State and Territory Financial Institutions legislation, will not only reduce regulatory duplication and clarify which law applies to particular areas of activity, but will also promote investor protection and confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The certainty that these amendments will bring to this area of the law is urgently needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Corporations and Securities Panel</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Special mention should also be made of the proposed amendments to the operations of the Corporations and Securities Panel. The Panel was established as a peer review group body to examine conduct in takeover matters referred to it for review by the ASC. In particular, it was empowered to make declarations of unacceptable conduct and acquisitions in respect of a takeover and to make orders to remedy such conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Panel's legislative charter was to conduct hearings with as little formality and technicality, and with as much expedition, as possible. However, the very first matter to come before the Panel bogged down in legal argument over its procedures. Following consideration of this case, the Government has decided that the Panel should be restructured to remove the procedural difficulties that it has disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the extension of the jurisdiction of the Panel to takeover conduct generally, and specifies with greater precision what constitutes procedural fairness for the purpose of the Panel's inquiries. Procedural fairness does not require that the Panel behave like a Court. Likewise, cross-examination of parties and witnesses is not a requirement of procedural fairness. The emphasis will, instead, be on written submissions by parties and strict time limits for submissions. After examining those submissions, the Panel will decide whether a conference (or "oral inquiry") is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the Panel's deliberations do not generally relate to technical legal matters, but rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties rather than their legal advisers, address the Panel. Legal advisers may, of course, be present to assist, but will not be entitled to address the Panel. This is the approach that has been successfully adopted in predetermination conferences by the Trade Practices Commission and should be equally successful here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also provide for regulations to set out in a comprehensive form the procedures for the conduct of the Panel's inquiries. Draft regulations have been released for public comment and the Government intends to have the regulations in place at the same time as these provisions come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention that the requirements of procedural fairness will be met where the procedural requirements set out in Division 3 of Part 10 of the Australian Securities Commission Act and in the regulations are followed in the course of an inquiry. During the debate on the bill in the House, the Government moved an amendment to omit the express exclusion of the rules of natural justice that had been proposed by item number 20 of Schedule 4 of the bill as introduced, and substitute a statement of the Government's intention in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Screen based trading systems</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide for the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes which are not listed on a stock exchange. The establishment of such retail markets is a significant development in Australia. Investors are currently reliant on the liquidity of scheme assets and the ability of the manager of a collective investment scheme to buy-back their investment. The measures proposed by the bill will greatly enhance the liquidity of such investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with stock exchanges, approved securities organisations and exempt stock markets, the establishment of any such market will require the approval of the Attorney-General. Each market will be operated in accordance with business rules, relevant agreements contemplated by those rules, and any conditions which are imposed on special market approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers of the ASC to supervise the special markets will be similar to those which it currently exercises in relation to the stock market of a securities exchange. The business rules will also require the appointment of an independent and appropriately qualified person to monitor compliance with the business rules and to report a contravention of those rules to the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clients' Segregated Accounts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I return now to the first of the two amendments that I have already mentioned were not included in the public exposure draft of the bill. That is the proposal to refine the law governing clients' segregated accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The segregation of client monies from that of brokers is a fundamental investor protection rule of the futures industry. Thus the Corporations Law requires that a broker maintain a clients' segregated account into which client funds are placed, and permits the withdrawal of funds from that account only in certain circumstances. Funds held in this way are immune from claims by creditors of the broker.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, changes to the way the futures industry operates has highlighted the need for some refinement of the detail of the law governing such accounts, so that it keeps abreast of developments in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the bill recognises that in a futures transaction involving a chain of intermediaries, monies can be identified as client monies and continue to be treated as such. The result will be that client monies involved in such transactions will enjoy the full protection afforded by the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other reforms proposed by the bill are the introduction of a modified regime for the notification of persons affected by ASC decisions of their rights of review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975; the introduction into the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 of the penalty units system for the prescription of penalties; and the transfer of unclaimed money functions of the Attorney-General under the Corporations Law to the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A complete list of the reforms proposed by the bill is set out at the start of the Explanatory Memorandum</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on Government or business as the majority of the proposed amendments clarify existing provisions of the Corporations Law and will not result in additional costs. The Explanatory Memorandum details the extent of the potential impact on business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to return briefly to the simplification program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now seven months since the Task Force first met. The Task Force consists of four experts, two of whom work in the private sector. It is responsible for developing proposals and draft legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A private sector Consultative Group has also been established to provide expert advice and assistance to th Task Force. This group consists of representatives of large and small users of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December the Task Force released a plan of action which outlined how it proposed to go about the overall project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That plan of action identified seven initial priority areas where early practical gains for business are possible. They include streamlining the corporate structure for small business, facilitating share buybacks, rationalising annual reporting requirements and reducing the burden of maintaining company registers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim is for simplification to occur in manageable stages so that benefits can be achieved as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force's first simplification proposal, concerning share buybacks, was released in early March. The law in this area is currently extremely complex, burdensome and expensive to comply with. Its cumbersome nature and complexity deters companies from using the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force's proposal on buybacks involves an emphasis on the basics. The aim is to discard the excessive detail and technicality in the current law. By the end of the consultation process we will have developed provisions that companies can actually use, consistent with the need for adequate safeguards for shareholders and creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same principles for simplification apply to small business structures. Our smallest companies are currently regulated under a scheme primarily designed to supervise our largest companies. Clearly this not only makes life difficult for small companies, but in many situations is simply illogical. A proposal to simplify the proprietary company structure to ease the burdens for existing and new small businesses was released for public comment in March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The twin emphasis on clarity and elimination of unnecessary paperwork continues in the Task Force proposal, released at the end of April, to do away with many of the requirements for company register keeping. Where adequate information for investors and creditors is readily available through the Australian Stock Exchange or through access to the ASC database, unnecessary requirements to maintain registers can be removed. In other cases the information held is unnecessary. The proposal would also make the remaining obligations easier to use by bringing them together in the Law, streamlining the requirements and making them more uniform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest Task Force proposal, released in May, deals with annual returns and financial reporting to shareholders. Under the proposal, the annual return would be streamlined by reducing the number of items of information it contains by around 75%. In addition, companies which are required to prepare annual accounts would have the option of sending concise financial reports to shareholders. This would have the dual benefit of cost savings for companies and easier to read financial reports for shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force is working towards a first draft bill for public exposure by about mid-year, but the process will not be rushed. In particular, the Task Force is determined to consult widely on its proposals before it drafts the legislation. This will provide an essential opportunity for business and other user groups to influence the basic policy as it is being developed. The first simplification bill will deal with buybacks, proprietary companies and company registers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I confirm that, in accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, given approval for the introduction of the bill into Parliament. In particular, the amendments proposed by Schedule 3 of the bill, rationalising the interface between the Corporations Law and State and Territory Financial Institutions legislation, have received the unanimous agreement of the Council.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the resolution of the Senate of 24 March 1994, referring issues relating to the Rural Adjustment Scheme to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, be modified as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After paragraph (c), add the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(d)examine through the exceptional circumstance provisions of the Rural Adjustment Act, the necessity to put additional support mechanisms in place for farmers in farming areas where soil type and/or rainfall and/or location prevent diversification".</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to this motion to indicate that there has been quite a long process through which this issue has gone in order to arrive at this point. I did originally propose a much longer reference to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and, after discussion with a number of senators, withdrew that motion and sought to add an additional clause to the current reference before the committee&mdash;that is, a reference relating to the rural adjustment scheme. I want to add these words so that inadequacies in the terms of reference which were identified by my colleague Senator Lees and me might be rectified. The words we want to add are printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, and they are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . examine through the exceptional circumstance provisions of the Rural Adjustment Act, the necessity to put additional support mechanisms in place for farmers in farming areas where soil type and/or rainfall and/or location prevent diversification.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for moving that is that we believe that particular issues relate to these farmers, especially those in South Australia, which need to be addressed by this additional reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), who, following the original terms of reference which I moved and this new term of reference, sent me a number of documents. These were very helpful in assisting me to understand what has already been done in this area. However, I still wish to press the additional term of reference and particularly quote from the documents which the minister has sent to me. The first one was the malting barley strategic planning unit report on the progress of the work of this particular unit. This unit, as the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has adopted a three stage approach and engaged a consultant to develop a strategic plan for the malting barley industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I am interested that stage two of the plan involved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . determining key performance indicators, benchmarking against international best practice, assessing customer needs and market opportunities, production constraints, variety development processes, receival procedures and quality control.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a meeting on 23 May, the MBSPU's Steering Committee (SC) endorsed a completed report on stage 2 and a work plan for completing the project.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems with the barley industry is that it is not simply the malting barley industry which is a problem but even more so the feed barley industry. I note the comment in the report which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to marketing structures and arrangements, the consultants acknowledge that the State marketing authorities provide a focused selling effort and that marketing arrangements are suitable in some market segments, but not in others.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats really have to disagree quite fundamentally with that comment because we believe one of the real problems with the barley industry is the various independent state marketing bodies which compete with each other for markets. So, although I thank the minister for that report, it really simply confirmed the problems and fears that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another report the minister sent me is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grains industry strategic planning: the processes for inventing the future</EMPHASIS>. This was a helpful document to read but again it raised problems for me. It certainly presented a very comprehensive inquiry which is being conducted but it does not answer all the questions which we have. It is worth recording the purposes and charter of each strategic planning unit. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms the basic purpose of each Strategic Planning Unit is to identify and analyse all of the factors which relate to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>then a number of different categories are listed, namely:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the current and future capability of the Australian industry to supply the markets and meet customer requirements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the factors which affect the relative competitiveness of the Australian industry;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the opportunities, challenges and impediments identified for the Australian grains industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and so on. Then it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While SPU's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the strategic planning units&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">share the same basic purpose, their specific objectives differ slightly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>then listed is the malting barley PSU. I note that this was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . convened to identify and remedy structural, operational, technical and agronomic impediments to the development and prosperity of the Australian malting barley industry.</PARA>
<PARA>But, again, it does not mention the feed barley industry. I will comment on this report of the Grains Council of Australia a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of the Democrats, we believe, still need to be covered by this additional reference. I want to read from a letter from a South Australian barley grower who is concerned that the grain growers inquiry will not get at the problems which he faces. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess two things come to mind, firstly, yes, the Strategic Planning Unit goes part of the way&mdash;but does not address the issues that confront farmers who do not have a readily available, commercially viable, field proven alternative to barley. Most of, if not all, the opposition I hear to the issues that we have raised comes from people who have these alternatives via higher rainfall &amp; better soil types, but these same people will move back into barley production tomorrow, if they see a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These same people appear to not want to tackle the hard issue of what to do in marginal lands, and to say close them down is no answer, probably would tend to create more problems than it would solve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, we accepted from day one that this would not be easy, but some recent research into farming in the UK only makes me more determined to pursue the issue of farm income, because it would appear that we in Australia could be the only developed nation in the world to treat our food producers in this manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, remember that the Strategic Planning Unit are looking at Malting Barley&mdash;not feed barley, which makes up the bulk of our crop annually, and is worth some $30 per tonne less than malting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also Sen Collins likes to refer to GATT being of a greater benefit to wheat or more immediate than barley&mdash;what he forgets is that wheat is also a feed grain and is sold into exactly the same markets in direct competition with barley, so therefore having a direct impact on price.</PARA>
<PARA>To return to the Grains Council inquiry, the Australian Democrats certainly support the thrust of that inquiry, we wish it well and we want to take note of the results and support its progress. However, we have concerns about some of the directions of the inquiry. For example, it appears that the Grains Council believes that the future of the industry lies in its becoming much more market oriented than production oriented. That sounds all very well, and it is in line with much of the rhetoric about the efficiency of market forces; however, it does not address the question of the kind of market forces and which markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simple illustration of the problem lies in a critique of one of the fundamental laws of the marketplace, the law of supply and demand: that is, as long as there is demand for a product and the grower can supply the product, the market should operate to enable both ends of the market to meet. Yet, Australian grain producers are being told that their problem is overproduction of grain in a world in which millions of people are starving. The law of supply and demand is rendered inoperative by an international financial system in which money has become a commodity rather than a means of exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this kind of world real commodities such as food and fibre are stockpiled instead of being delivered to where the demand is greatest. Thus commodities which sustain life are rendered immobile and money, a pseudo commodity, is universally and constantly mobile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are also concerned at the pressure on farmers to diversify their investment interests and areas of production. This is good advice for those farmers who have moved back into solid profitability and who live in areas where diversification is an option; however, many farmers do not have a readily available commercially viable field proven alternative for their present narrow range of cropping and grazing options. It was with these farmers in mind that the Democrats moved the original terms of reference for an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly senators from the government and the opposition were sympathetic to what we were proposing. They feel, however, that our concerns are covered by current Rural and Regional Affairs Committee inquiries into land care and the rural adjustment scheme. The Democrats are committed to the issues referred to in our final term of reference. We intend to pursue these issues through those inquiries. However, we are also hopeful that the additional terms of reference to the RAS inquiry may be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, some media commentators have described the 33 per cent rise in farm income forecast for 1993-94 as evidence that Australia's struggling rural sector is on the road to recovery. But one does not have to dig very deep into the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures to realise that things are not as rosy as we might all hope. The bottom line for farmers is and always has been farm profitability, and on this measure we see that only one quarter of farm businesses are likely to be in the black this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that for the average farmer this will be the fourth year in a row of farm losses. Of course, the average farmer does not really exist, so many are looking at the sixth or seventh year behind the eight ball. The implications of this for Australia's entire farm sector are enormous as the investment for capital replacement necessary to maintain our farmers' efficiency and margin over competitors is simply not able to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats called on the government to take urgent action to address crippling farm debt and to extend the 10 per cent investment allowance to primary producers for a further 12 months, and that was supported by the National Farmers Federation. We also urge support for the additional reference which we are debating today. Until these calls are heeded Australian farm families will continue to be driven from the land. Indeed, if the current exodus of family farmers continues, I predict that in 20 years time the only place where we will be able to see family farmers will be in a rural museum because by then they will all be stuffed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some sympathy with Senator Woodley in his genuine desire to make sure that the current reference to the committee, on which we both serve, provides some meaningful outcomes for people in the rural community who are seeking improvements to the rural adjustment scheme. I have complete sympathy with the people in the rural sector who have these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not believe that at this stage we ought to be altering in any way the terms of reference which have already been circulated and to which people have responded with submissions. In fact, we received the terms of reference on 24 March; the inquiry was advertised extensively; we have had something like 239 submissions; we have had four days of hearings so far and, to be fair, we would have to rehear all those people from whom we have already heard because they would be looking at different terms of reference. We have to look at it in that light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By extending or altering the current terms we will put considerable time pressures on the committee to complete its work. We have already said that we want this inquiry to finish in the quickest time. We have been looking at the adequacies of the scheme to see if it is working properly because people are hurting. I believe it is very important that it is done quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has a very tight timetable in order to meet the deadlines imposed by the Senate for this reference. It will require a great deal of work by the committee and, more importantly, its secretariat to ensure that we complete the inquiry by October. I hope that some of the committee's findings will cover a number of the concerns raised by Senator Woodley. In fact, I am sure that that will be the case. However, it would not be appropriate for the committee formally at this stage to adopt a change in the terms of reference only in this case. I believe that it will set a bad precedent which others may seek to follow. Having once altered the terms of reference in this instance, it will be hard to refuse requests by others who wish to do so. I believe that once terms of reference have been decided for a committee, it is important that the committee should stick to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley should ask the constituents whom he believes he is representing through this extended reference to write to the committee under the existing terms of the inquiry highlighting the need for the rural adjustment scheme to provide an appropriate financial framework, taking into consideration the ability or otherwise of particular farmers to diversify their current farming operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In ensuing meetings of the inquiry, Senator Woodley will be able to ask whatever questions he wishes. One sees from the committee's terms of reference that it has been set up to examine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the adequacy of the rural adjustment scheme, including its current guidelines and operations, in meeting the present and future needs of primary producers suffering from prolonged adverse circumstances beyond their control.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say that provision covers all the areas of concern mentioned by Senator Woodley. The committee already has the aim of examining, through the exceptional circumstance provision of the Rural Adjustment Act, the necessity to put additional support mechanisms in place for farmers in farming areas where soil type and/or rainfall and/or location prevent diversification. We have already said that we want to look at the RAS and current guidelines&mdash;in other words, at the guidelines as they now exist. Certainly it would appear that Senator Woodley's separate term of reference is already covered by what the committee is considering. The second term of reference before the committee relates to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent of rural debt, the nature and serviceability of that debt and its social, economic and ecological consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I believe that covers some of the concerns expressed by Senator Woodley. The third term of reference before the committee relates to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">what mechanisms should be recommended for the management of rural reconstruction and the contributing roles of government, the financial sector and industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The terms of reference already before the committee are so broad that they will encompass any sectional or other interest that people may discover on the way through the inquiry. As the chairman of the committee has already said, the committee is half way through its hearings. It has already had four days of hearings and I hope that it will be able to report in October, and certainly before Christmas. If we add this extra term of reference I believe it will put an extra load on those concerned and I think that is unnecessary. Certainly I feel it will not add to the inquiry in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the broad parameters that already exist, what Senator Woodley seeks to do can be achieved during the forthcoming hearings by way of question and answer. Indeed, this morning the committee had before it submissions on the rural adjustment scheme presented by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Senator Woodley can put all his questions to those witnesses when next they appear before the committee. Therefore, we would be better to stick with the present terms of reference, leaving Senator Woodley, if he so wishes, to bring up during the inquiry any matters he wishes to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will be voting against this additional reference. We do not take this course because the reference has no worth or has no ideas behind it. However, Senator Woodley may wish to elucidate those ideas during the inquiry. Certainly we believe that the present terms of reference are adequate. So far the inquiry has gone very well and has heard some very good evidence on how RAS is working. I repeat that the opposition will vote against this changed reference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the mover of the original motion that is now before the Senate, I wish to put some issues on the record because I feel they are important. Early in March before I moved the motion in the Senate, I spoke to Senator Woodley. I invited him to examine the proposed terms of reference that were to be put to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and to say whether he had anything to add. Had he done so, I would have been happy to have included his ideas. Indeed, I believe Senator Woodley had some input to the motion. If he had no direct input, certainly he appeared to agree with what we were putting up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt Senator Woodley's integrity or indeed his concern for the welfare of the people of rural Australia. However, if we were to adopt this further reference proposed by Senator Woodley, I believe it would involve the committee in a number of additional tasks. First, the committee would have to re-advertise the terms of reference. I do not know the exact cost of so doing but I gather it would involve a sum of $25,000 to $30,000&mdash;certainly a considerable amount of money. Furthermore, all the people who have made submissions to the committee would have to resubmit their proposals in line with the new terms of reference. Such an exercise would be totally impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third consequence of adoption of the further reference would mean&mdash;and this certainly would be expensive&mdash;the committee having to revisit certain states. It has already visited Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria and taken evidence in those places. If the terms of reference were to be altered in any way, no doubt those states would have to be revisited, hearings reopened and submissions reheard. Again, such a course would be totally impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the committee is aiming to finish its deliberations by a certain date. Certainly the sooner its task is completed the better. Once the report is laid on the table the government will have to respond to its recommendations. The government has provided a sum of $352 million in the rural adjustment scheme covering the next three years. That money is available to service the whole of rural Australia when people in the rural areas are going through tough times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that the family farm is now under great threat. The way in which we can help the family farm is by bringing down the committee's report on the rural adjustment scheme as quickly as possible so that we may achieve a result. We should allow the government to respond to the committee's recommendations and the sooner that occurs the better for all the family farms that we are concerned about. Therefore, in light of all these circumstances I believe it is impracticable to cause the inquiry to sit for possibly a further two months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I designed the terms of reference for this committee, I deliberately drew them up in order that they would be wide. I wanted the terms to encompass all the concerns that had been expressed to me by people in primary industry throughout rural Australia. The terms of reference sought to encompass all the problems of rural Australia in terms of the rural adjustment scheme. The original terms of reference will pick up all the concerns expressed by Senator Woodley. Therefore, I see no need to support the additional terms of reference proposed by Senator Woodley. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this morning, when talking about the exceptional circumstances provisions, it was pointed out to us by representatives of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that they were again looking at the exceptional circumstances provisions because they have been rather controversial. I imagine that if further provisions were added to the exceptional circumstances provisions the whole thing would become even more controversial and harder to interpret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had evidence to the effect that 55 per cent of claims and 58 per cent of the money allocated by the rural adjustment scheme has been under the exceptional circumstances provisions. Everywhere we have gone&mdash;in all the different states&mdash;the evidence has been that, while the guidelines are interpreted somewhat differently, in nearly all cases they have been used in a way that covers these exceptional circumstances. I believe that to put any more slant on what constitutes exceptional circumstances, as Senator Woodley is trying to do, would be to further confuse the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major arguments is that this inquiry, following on, as it does, from the 1988 inquiry, puts extra pressure on the people administering the scheme. But those people just want to get on with the job and do what they do best&mdash;looking after the farmers through this rural adjustment scheme. There has already been criticism of this inquiry changing the direction of the scheme. Since most people are happy with the present direction, I see no advantage in supporting this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 has passed through the House of Representatives with something of a chequered history. The bill was released in draft form in 1993. Variations were made to the draft&mdash;certain things were put in and, when they did not turn out as the government expected, certain bits were taken out. Frankly, it has been a bit of a mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate in the other place the opposition was concerned about two things in particular. The one I would like to concentrate on in this debate is the opposition's concern for the people who appear before the panel, as outlined in schedule 4, to have the right to have someone speaking on their behalf. In the second reading speech the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the Panel's deliberations do not generally relate to technical legal matters, but rather to matters of market behaviour and market standards, it is more appropriate that the parties rather than their legal advisers, address the Panel. Legal advisers may, of course, be present to assist, but will not be entitled to address the Panel. This is the approach that has been successfully adopted in predetermination conferences by the Trade Practices Commission and should be equally successful here.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition happens to disagree. We say that while this particular panel will of course concern itself with matters relating to the market, it is drawing a very long bow to say that there are no legal consequences of determinations. Therefore, it is perfectly appropriate that people be entitled to have their legal advisers, or any other adviser, speak on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people finally get out of law school and qualify, the first thing they are told is, `If, as a lawyer, you advise yourself, you have a fool for a client.' That is probably right. If people are too close to a matter, they cannot represent that matter well. Similar advice&mdash;it applies in my state, and I think it is good advice to young lawyers&mdash;is never to represent a friend and never to represent family; they are just too close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We probably all know people who, while they are very good lawyers, would not speak well on their own behalf if they felt that their position was under threat. We all know of fabulous academics whose brilliant minds would crack under the pressure of having to represent their own case in a matter which could result, say, in their dismissal from a university. Their minds are trained to concentrate on academic matters and not on the technicalities of taking a matter through a dismissal process. Those sorts of examples indicate the serious consequences of this proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is effectively saying that letting people have a representative who is informed and skilled in these matters and who will protect their interests is too cumbersome, too time consuming and, therefore, too costly. In order to make things more efficient and speedy, it is depriving people of the right to have someone speak on their behalf. That is not the way to fix this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my latest contact with representatives of the government, I understand that they propose to make provision in the regulations for the panel to decide that it may&mdash;I repeat, may&mdash;allow someone to have an agent to speak on their behalf. The right to be represented in a matter where personal interests are at stake should not be the prerogative of the person who, in one way or another, will affect those interests. That is ludicrous. It is analogous to magistrates deciding whether they will allow a person legal counsel on the basis of the importance of the matter or the competence of the person involved. That would be as laughable a notion as is this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition moved an amendment to this bill in the other place and we will be moving it again here. The amendment proposes that the existing section 194(4) be substituted with a new section under which persons appearing at an inquiry will be entitled to have another person present to assist them, and that persons so assisting will be entitled to address the panel. Such persons might not be lawyers; they could be merchant bankers or financial advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can easily think of a very wide range of people from whom a party before the panel may well want to seek advice. This business of being able to have someone there, but who cannot speak, which is the government's suggestion, is clearly not satisfactory. During any hearing people may have someone whispering in one ear about one matter and whispering in the other ear about another matter. It is a question of whether they completely understood the point that was being made. If they had the skills of the person advising them, they would not need that person there. So they must somehow comprehend what is being told to them and then translate that back. It is just an unnecessary waste of time. It may make the proceedings more inefficient because people will be pushing back their chairs, leaning back, talking to the counsel behind them about whatever advice they are offering&mdash;whether it is legal advice, financial advice, marketing advice or whatever&mdash;getting that advice, coming back to the table and doing that time and time again. It is just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say by way of a slight diversion&mdash;I do not want to divert for long&mdash;that it is typical of this government's view that everything that is wrong with the process of law stems from lawyers being involved; that somehow if we could get rid of private practitioners, everything would be all right, which is, of course, manifestly rubbish. I notice that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch)&mdash;rightly, I might say&mdash;has finally picked up the agenda run out of this chamber through the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that is, the cost of justice agenda. After some years during which the Attorney-General's Department said it was nothing much to do with it&mdash;it was, of course, conscious of the cost of justice but it was really a matter that the Senate committee was looking into&mdash;it is now focusing its energies in this area. It has even established a unit to follow through on the matter. The Attorney got Professor Sackville to bring together a range of reports that have been done. I notice that some sections of the media are hailing this as a great achievement. I do not think it was a great achievement. It was simply a recognition of what the Senate has been doing for a long time. I have had plenty of people say to me, `No disrespect to Sackville, but there is not much in there that is not already in the Senate committee reports.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we now find is that the agenda created by the Senate committee on an issue which was of concern in the community, which was picked up by the Senate and ignored by the House of Representatives, has finally been picked up by the Attorney. I do not say that to deride him; I say that to congratulate him on finally picking up on it. But I notice in his public pronouncements on this matter indications that it is the legal profession that is to blame. He might like to look closer to his own backyard in terms of the contribution to the cost of justice. He might like to look at the unproclaimed legislation which I think includes some corporations law. We had a huge fuss about it; probably thousands of dollars were spent. Parliamentary counsel would have worked on the drafts and there would have been lots of debates in the lower house and here. Then someone changed his mind and it did not go anywhere. It is just sitting there: it has been passed by parliament but not yet proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all adds to the cost. If the Attorney does not understand that there were commercial firms poring over that legislation, gearing up, getting ready to comply with it, trying to do their best and then finding it is not introduced, he must be whistling dixie in fairyland. Of course, he must understand that, because this government has made a practice of legislation by press release. It says, `There is no excuse for you not to be ready to comply with this legislation; you had a press release six months or 12 months ago telling you about it, and it operates from that day.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other arguments about retrospectivity, but in this case I am raising the argument that has been used in corporations law before: `Don't tell us you only saw this legislation two months ago. You have known for a year or more that this was coming, by way of a press release.' That indicates, therefore, an expectation that people will spend time, money and effort getting ready to comply with legislation that is almost through and is clearly going to get through. Having spent all of that time and money, we find the stuff is not proclaimed. That is all a cost. If the Attorney does not understand that that cost is recouped from clients in one way or another, he is again whistling dixie in fairyland, getting nowhere. We see that in the way in which this legislation has been handled&mdash;a draft release, as I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, some bits put in after the release and some bits taken out, all of which is a huge cost on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst all of that we have this brash proposal by the government that if we keep lawyers out, things will be a lot better. Some people would say that if parliament stopped passing new legislation and simply concentrated on cleaning up what it has already got, the law would be a lot easier to access and cheaper to administer. I raise that because we see this put time and time again&mdash;that lawyers are the cause of the problem, and they simply are not. In this case it could be said that it is the government's incapacity to act because it has been in power for 10 years or more and it is still fiddling in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should look to its own patch as to the contribution it makes to the cost of justice rather than do what the Attorney does and tend to exacerbate, by his own actions, the contribution that the legal profession makes, and accentuate it in the media. It now seems that we must have a national profession; we hear that the profession has to do this, that and everything else to reduce the cost of justice. I have yet to see a release from him about what he could do to reduce the cost of justice by getting his legislation right and, for that matter, by insisting that the advice offered through his department to other departments ensured that legislation of other ministers was correct and did not have to be redone in this place all the time. A little more focus on his own backyard would do him quite a bit of good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give notice that we will move that amendment so that somebody who appears before this tribunal should, as of right, be able to have an agent speaking on his or her behalf. It is not restricted to being solicitors; it may be financial advisers or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wanted to raise in this matter relates to the matter of natural justice. I want to accentuate something that appears in the bill because it is somewhat embarrassing. At page 59 of the bill, paragraph 278 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following technical problems with the current structure of the panel have been identified.</PARA>
<PARA>I like the language: `the following technical problems'. This is from a government that sends people around the country and around the globe preaching about human rights. This is one of the technical problems; it is just a technical problem; Mr Acting Deputy President, do not for a minute think that it is anything more than that! I say to Senator Crowley, the minister at the table, as she might like to listen to this, that this is the technical problem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirements of the rules of natural justice for the parties hinders the panel from coming to quick commercial decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a blow; what a huge blow! Natural justice has got in the way of quick commercial decisions, so let us dispose of it! I would like to see Senator Evans popping off around the globe telling everybody that when natural justice got in the way of things, especially if it got in the way of commercial things, we would get rid of it. What a good and sterling idea is that to come from a Labor party? I am almost incredulous at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the other place we wanted to ensure that the proposal to make sure that the rules of natural justice did not apply was removed. I see in the speech that has been distributed as the minister's second reading speech the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the debate on the bill in the House the government moved an amendment to omit the express exclusion of the rules of natural justice that had been proposed by item 20 of schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA>That is somewhat extraordinary, to have put so plainly that we still have in here as the preamble that natural justice gets in the way of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, because of that, the government decided that it would put a specific amendment in to get rid of those rules. Now, in the other place, the government has removed that expressed exclusion of the rules of natural justice and substituted a statement of its intention. I was at a loss to find where that is stated. I wonder whether the minister's advisers could help me find that expressed intention in the bill because this is a matter worth pursuing. I have dealt to the extent I want to with people having the right to have agents speak on their behalf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate tonight is discussing the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. There is no central theme to the bill. The amendments are largely designed to finetune certain aspects of the corporations law and, to a limited extent, streamline its provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is divided into seven schedules. The first schedule confers jurisdiction on lower courts for matters arising under corporations law. Currently, there is concern that the magistrates and district courts do not have such jurisdiction and this could well thwart the initiation of legitimate actions because people cannot afford to bring action in the superior courts. These concerns are addressed in schedule 1 conferring on lower and intermediate courts, civil jurisdiction in respect of corporate law claims. However, jurisdiction will not be granted where it involves high level discretionary powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 makes changes to the clearing house electronic subregister system known as CHESS. The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 provides for the electronic settlement of the transaction on the Australian Stock Exchange. It enables the Stock Exchange to introduce a new clearing house electronic subregister system through the establishment of an approved securities clearing house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 implements a decision of the Ministerial Council for Corporations and the Ministerial Council for Financial Institutions who agreed on the principles by which the interface of corporations law and the financial institutions legislation should be rationalised. At present, the activities of financial institutions are regulated by both the corporations law and state and territory financial institutions legislation. These financial institutions are principally building societies and credit unions. Schedule 3 then makes provision to implement the rationalisation decision in relation to the companies and securities law schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that the government is making in this bill will mean that: the fundraising and market offence provisions of the corporations law are to apply to financial institutions with certain specified exemptions; the duties of officers and charges over the property of financial institutions are to be regulated solely by financial institutions legislation; and the registration of financial institutions under the corporations law as registrable Australian bodies will no longer be required. These appear to be basically worthwhile micro-economic reforms, except one should perhaps note that we are, in one sense, fragmenting the system again and moving away from a central corporation system in this respect and giving some jurisdiction to state based legislation. No doubt the system will need to be monitored on this aspect to ensure that the move has been adequately prepared and that it will function adequately in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 contains provisions in relation to the operations of the corporations and securities panel. The amendments are designed to change the way the panel makes its decisions in a number of ways. Currently, upon application by the Australian Securities Commission, the panel examines such matters as corporate takeover conduct and can make a declaration of unacceptable conduct. The panel may also make an order prohibiting certain conduct and its orders are enforceable in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This panel was created as a fact-finding body to assess market standards and market behaviour and not matters of a technical or legal nature. However, in the panel's first case, the Titan Hills matter, there was a perceived inadequacy in the panel's procedure and its inability to deal with matters expeditiously. It is for this reason that the government has reviewed the panel's procedures. One of the provisions which has provoked some extensive comment and which we have looked at very closely is the suggestion that parties before the panel should not have, as of right, the possibility of having a representative on their behalf address the panel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions do not exclude an adviser being present and do not prohibit the provision of advice and assistance while the matter is before the panel. It merely excludes, as of right, the possibility of having the panel addressed by that separate representative, except by leave of the panel. This is a provision that the government has agreed to following concerns expressed on this matter. The Australian Democrats have given this some considerable consideration and weighed up the balance between allowing the panel as a fact-finding body to proceed quickly and expeditiously, relying on the knowledge of its panel members of the securities industry in a practical sense, rather than being held up and bogged down in complicated legal argument. This provision therefore, in our view, has some merit and the Australian Democrats will be supporting the government on this and not supporting the amendment that has been foreshadowed by the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are cognisant of the fact that where a matter before the panel is, in the view of one of the parties, dealt with in an unsatisfactory way, in a way that it is felt legal representation is required, the matter can be brought before the Federal Court where legal representation is available as a matter of course. If that avenue had not been available, our decision may well have been different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that has agitated a number of people&mdash;and this is a weighty matter&mdash;is the exclusion of the rules of natural justice. The government has modified once again its position on this issue and has inserted a provision which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that this division and the regulations will set out procedural requirements that equate to the rules of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned about this provision. It is certainly better than the original one that the government sought to include, which simply would have excluded the operation of the rules of natural justice and which the Australian Democrats certainly would have opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current configuration we do not raise an objection and will not vote against this clause, as amended by the government. But we would like to foreshadow that we will certainly monitor very closely the regulations that are made under this scheme to ensure that basically the principles of natural justice are observed within the objectives of the panel that will operate under this legislation. We want to ensure that parties before the panel do not lose their proper legal rights under the rules of natural justice. As indicated, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, might I say that I am in agreement with the majority of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I think the government has addressed adequately some aspects of corporations law which needed looking at. In passing, I touch on the subject that Senator Spindler raised, and that is the extension of jurisdiction in relation to the hearing of matters under this legislation. I believe that is a good move and one which accords with making access to justice less costly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I join with Senator Vanstone in taking exception to schedule 4, which deals with the corporation and securities panel. Before embarking on some observations in relation to that schedule, I draw to the Senate's attention how this came to be. The panel was set up as a peer group review body to regulate behaviour in relation to company takeovers. Throughout the 1980s we have seen the takeover of companies achieve notoriety and, in fact, in Western Australia, the state that I represent, these activities have achieved more than just notoriety. So some sort of review of the standard of behaviour in this regard is no bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the question is: what power will this peer group review body have and how should it be conducted? It was a result of the takeover of Titan Hills by Precision Data Holdings that brought this all to the fore. As stated in the explanatory memorandum, the following technical problems in relation to the structure of the panel were identified as a result of that case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the hearing powers do not discourage time wasting litigation between the parties;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the requirements of the rules of natural justice for the parties hinders the Panel from coming to quick commercial decisions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Panel's jurisdiction in relation to takeovers does not cover unfair conduct connected with some takeovers; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Panel cannot enforce undertakings that are given by the parties to its proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the government set about to rectify what it saw as these defects which arose from that one takeover which was referred to the panel. The government has stated that to meet these concerns a number of changes were required to the current operations of the panel. So it proposes to amend the corporations law to improve the capacity of the members of the panel to better control the panel's proceedings. The conduct of procedural fairness to be applied by the panel and the panel's procedures are to be expressly set out in regulations. Of course, the government's amendment states that natural justice is to be governed by these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Vanstone stated, that is not entirely satisfactory because when we take that course of action we are really delegating legislation to a lower order of things. We are really delegating an important aspect such as natural justice to be dealt with by way of regulation. The procedure of such a panel, with the power that it has, should really be looked at by this Senate. That is one objection I would make in relation to the argument that natural justice can be looked at by regulation. The other matters that are being proposed are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Panel's jurisdiction is to be extended to encompass certain conduct associated with a takeover; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Panel will be empowered to accept undertakings from the parties which will be enforceable by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand why the government wants matters to be conducted in an expeditious fashion. When one is dealing with commercial decisions, any delay can be costly. But, nonetheless, the rights of various parties are being affected, be they the rights of directors or shareholders and, indirectly perhaps, the rights of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we affect these rights of people in such a way we need to approach the matter with the utmost caution. Indeed, I do not believe we can simply say, `Well, let the regulations take care of it.' Natural justice requires that if one's rights are affected or if there is some prejudice that an individual can suffer, there should be an opportunity for that individual to present his or her own argument or case, there should be some opportunity to test the case that is presented against them and, furthermore, there should be a right to representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not just dealing with representation here by ruling out the assistance of third parties. As Senator Vanstone said, we could be looking at the use of stockbrokers, accountants and the like. When we are dealing with takeovers we might need to call an accountant to give assistance to the panel as to the figures of the company or how a matter might by affected. A stockbroker, similarly, might cover an area which a lawyer is not competent or qualified to adequately put forward. By the use of such qualified people we might end up assisting the panel to reach a speedy and informed conclusion as to the method of the takeover. I think it is highly desirable that we have the assistance of such third parties there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that submissions could be made in writing and that that could add to the informal nature of the panel. But the problem is this: the panel is embarking on regulating behaviour in a most complex area of the law. The area of takeover of companies is indeed complex and it is not a subject that is approached in a cavalier or trite manner. I am not saying that is how the panel would approach it but such informality could well result in an ill-informed decision and that could result in perhaps untoward behaviour being overlooked in a takeover. I am sure that that is not what the government or the Democrats who have spoken on this matter are after in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are dealing with a complex area and we say we will make it informal, I believe we are creating a recipe for disaster. I believe that informality should be the goal, wherever possible. I believe that we do not have to include lawyers in every tribunal or every panel. Nonetheless, where we have such complexity, we could well be throwing out the baby with the bathwater by excluding any avenue of representation or advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In February this year I placed on notice a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer, seeking to clarify a number of points related to the 1992-93 annual report issued by the Royal Australian Mint. On 10 May, Senator Cook tabled the response detailing the answers of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). I have since had a chance to examine those answers and discuss them with people associated with the mint. There are a number of areas where the Treasurer's answers fail to provide satisfactory explanations for what appears to be an extraordinary set of procedures leading to the publication of the annual report in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I had asked why the annual report had not been signed and forwarded to the Treasurer by the acting controller who had been responsible for the mint during the entire duration of the year being reported on. The report is, after all, designed to provide an historical record to the minister and the parliament by the officers accountable for the performance of the reporting agency. The answer was that there was a new controller in place when the report was finalised and printed. However, as the report had already been written and the financial statements finalised by the previous controller, there seems to be no valid reason why the report should not have gone out over his name. The document was a report on the 1992-93 year when the prior controller had control of the mint and he had prepared the document for printing before he departed. It appears not only petty, therefore, to issue the report over the name of a later controller, but also quite irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I asked whether the organisational structure shown in the report was in fact implemented or in place at any time during the year being reported on. The answer confirmed my suspicion that it was not. The new organisational structure was in fact only discussed during the 1992-93 year and was not even endorsed, in principle, by the Secretary to the Treasury until October 1993. It therefore seems to me to be totally misleading to include the structure in the report before it had been approved or implemented. If the structure was implemented in the following year, 1993-94, then the appropriate place to feature it is in the report for the 1993-94 year, not in a year when it had not yet been introduced. This element of the report, therefore, appears to be a blatant and unwarranted attempt to mislead the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I asked the question as to whether some $3,000 had been expended in withdrawing the report from the printer in order to make changes, and whether these changes were designed to again mislead the parliament. The answer confirmed that the last minute changes incurred an additional printer's cost of $3,120, and claimed that they were required to remove inaccuracies and make the report more suitable as a marketing and reference document&mdash;quite plausible on prima facie reasoning. However, again there appears to be serious doubt as to the justification for this action. The mint already had a full set of marketing brochures, including an up-to-date capability brochure, that met its marketing needs. Why then incur additional last minute costs towards the annual report when marketing is far from the prime purpose of the document? There was no need for the annual report to be a marketing document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the additional costs were incurred, the report had already been to Treasury through a number of drafts, and its comments had been incorporated into the so-called final version. The accuracy of the original final document could be attested by the fact that the audit office had confirmed for the fifth successive year, and without qualification, the financial statements which were to be incorporated into the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that there are a number of areas where subjective opinion may be called into play. The Public Service Act of 1922 and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Requirements for departmental annual reports</EMPHASIS> require these reports to be tightly written and accurate. Even though there are still opportunities for creative and imaginative presentation, it appears that this particular report has utilised these opportunities far too loosely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to say that my main concern with this whole matter lies in the likelihood that we have here a document which is misleading and not in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. I am certain that the answers to my questions failed to address the real concerns that should have led to further investigation of the reasons why the report was published as it was. My original concerns have not been diminished by the answers to my questions, and my greatest fear is that at this stage the queries may never be satisfactorily put to rest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week was refugee week and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about one of the problems that accelerate the movement of refugees around the globe. The global affliction of landmines and other war technology has acted to exacerbate the world's refugee problem. Landmines in particular have acted as a barrier for people returning to their homelands. The presence of landmines also delivers a constant threat to civilians in the areas where they are placed. This creates an anxious and unstable existence for people who cannot be resettled or enjoy personal freedoms. They cannot farm their land and grow their own food. In short, they cannot rebuild their lives. We currently have 20 million refugees in the world, which this year alone has increased by 800,000 due to the crises in Bosnia, Rwanda and Yemen. And when the fighting stops, the killing goes on thanks to the presence of landmines that maim and kill men, women and children every day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubting how horrendous, cruel and indiscriminate landmines are. Many of them cost between US$1 and US$3 to manufacture. Many are non-detectable because they are made solely of plastic and are disguised as childs toys, balls, plates, apples and saucepans. There is no recording or marking of mine placements and they are scattered widely and indiscriminately. They are also not self-neutralising and may last decades after a war is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presence of landmines is no small problem. Twelve countries with experience in current conflicts possess landmines which are manufactured by 43 countries. These 12 are Afghanistan with nine to 10 million mines, Angola with nine million mines, Iraq with five to 10 million mines, Kuwait with five million mines, Cambodia with four to seven million mines, Western Sahara with one to two million mines, Mozambique with one to two million mines and Somalia, Bosnia Herzegovina and Croatia with one million mines each. Two others, Libya and Poland, still have landmines left over from World War II. This is just a small illustration of the problem because world wide there are 85 to 100 million landmines in 62 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every month, 162 civilians die from landmines. I have mentioned that the presence of mines means agricultural land is lost to communities. In Angola, eight to nine million people cannot be repatriated on their lost agricultural land and many people have starved. The presence of the mines also acts as a deterrent for people not only to reconstruct their land, but also to move back into their home countries. In Afghanistan, for example, where 350,000 people have died from landmine blasts, the presence of landmines has created 3.5 million Afghan refugees. At the present rate of mine clearing, it is estimated that it will take a further 4,300 years to clear remaining mines so that people can resume normal lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which are the countries that support and benefit from this genocide? There are 95 manufacturers in 43 countries manufacturing landmines. Countries involved include the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden and Switzerland. It is pleasing to note that Nelson Mandela has recently stopped the sale of landmines from South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mines may be cheap and nasty to manufacture but each mine costs around $1,000 to remove in a dangerous and painstaking process. General John Sanderson, who was with UNTAC in Cambodia in 1992-93 involved in de-mining operations, has said that there has been a distinct trend in military strategy since World War II from using weapons on military personnel to directly targeting and involving civilians. Landmines, he states, is one of those tools in targeting civilians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two types of landmines; anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. In this speech tonight I will be discussing anti-personnel mines. These include blast and fragmentation anti-personnel mines. Blast mines are for maiming and fragmentation mines are self-explanatory. The thinking behind this is that maiming someone places a greater burden and cost on society for a longer time than killing someone outright. These costs include medical costs, loss of land and the high costs of mine clearance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we begin to solve some of these atrocious problems? We need to use international laws, conventions and treaties to control the manufacture, sale, trade and transfer of landmines. One major problem in this regard is the position of the United States, which is against the banning of all landmines because it believes it is not in the interests of its `national security'. It would prefer a partial ban only. It specifies that those landmines that are non-self destructing, non-detectable and that have anti-handling devices should be banned. This position, however, would aid only de-mining operations and would in no way reduce civilian casualties during situations of conflict and before de-mining operations begin. I have already commented on the enormous time delay in mine clearance operations. Nevertheless, as the situation is so serious, a partial ban as a first step towards ridding the world of these vile weapons is perhaps worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we need an eventual total ban on landmines, however, rather than a partial ban; but we also need stricter rules now on the reporting and marking of landmines to aid quick detection. The current situation is that countries need to report where they place landmines only when it is a pre-planned exercise. We also need to take action in the world community to stigmatise the use of landmines for military objectives. Finally, the international community needs to cooperate to enforce the banning of the stockpiling, manufacture, transfer and trade of landmines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to enforce the existing 1980 Convention on the Use of Inhumane Weapons. Rather than agreeing to the principle of not using landmines, we must make countries implement this principle and make them accountable. International participants need training in the international law, ratification and enforcement through domestic law, the implementation of criminal convictions and fact finding missions by regional allies to encourage reporting of progress on phasing out landmines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only gains for civilians in banning landmines in order for them to regain some semblance of normality after the trauma of war. We need to work together locally, na-</PARA>

The Task Force was asked to report back by March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Review was of major long-term significance to ATSIC it was decided to engage a consultant with special skills and knowledge, with particular experience and sensitivity to inter-Government relations, to assist ATSIC in its dealings with the State Government and the Task Force throughout the term of the Review. ATSIC chose Mr Chaney, a former Federal Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, who is now a Research Fellow at the Graduate School of Management (GSM) at the University of Western Australia. ATSIC subsequently approached the GSM to engage the services of Mr Chaney from 24 September 1993 for a six month period and the contract agreed to was between ATSIC and the GSM.</PARA>
