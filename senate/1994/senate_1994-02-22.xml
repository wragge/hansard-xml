<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the minister responsible for ASIS. Is it the case that ASIS is holding tens of thousands of files on ordinary Australians, as suggested by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last night? Does ASIS have access to personal files held by other government organisations such as Telecom, the Department of Social Security, Medicare and the Australian Taxation Office? Is the Privacy Commissioner aware of the existence of these files, and does he have any role in preventing the inappropriate use of this information?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that ASIS does have some files, as one would expect in an organisation of that nature, even though its brief extends to activities outside the country rather than inside. They are essentially of an administrative nature. The number of them that could be so described I am not sure of; I will need to get further information about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements for oversight and ensuring that privacy guarantees and so on are observed here, as elsewhere, are effectively centred in the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, an office that was, of course, set up following the second Hope royal commission as the primary method of oversight and scrutiny of ASIS administration. I am confident that no privacy invasion issues have arisen as a consequence&mdash;</PARA>

I have not sought or received further information about that specific issue since last night; I will do so. But, when I have inquired about this in the past&mdash;as I have, because the issue has been raised in various ways in the past&mdash;I have been satisfied that the files that are maintained are essentially for in-house purposes and that the oversight arrangements that apply in house and the scrutiny arrangements that apply so far as the independent mechanism of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security are concerned are sufficient between them to ensure that no privacy issue of any proper concern in fact arises.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I reiterate that part of my question that sought to find out whether in fact ASIS has access to personal files held by other government departments such as Telecom. I mentioned Telecom in particular but I referred also to the Department of Social Security, Medicare and the Australian Taxation Office. Also, following from the minister's answer, is the minister saying that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is aware of all the files that are held, that he has had access to them and that he is satisfied that they do not go beyond issues of national security?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my understanding&mdash;and I will seek further information on that matter&mdash;that there is no right of access of any automatic kind to those files which might exist elsewhere. Whether any access has in fact been sought on any occasion in the past is something about which I will seek an answer. Whether it is possible to give any further information publicly about this or any other matter of an operational nature is, of course, a difficult question, as is always the case when one is talking about a security organisation. But I do not think, from the briefing that I can recall having in the past on this issue, that any question of this kind arises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIS is basically not that kind of organisation. Its brief does not extend to domestic matters of this kind. I cannot think of any circumstances where it would be relevant to seek information of the kind that might be held. But I am not in a position to give an absolute answer, so I will not. Could I ask Senator Hill to repeat the last part of his supplementary question?</PARA>

In order to do that he must, of course, have complete access at his own discretion and choosing to anything he wants to. That is my understanding of the way the system works. Again, if I have any further information to offer on that subject, having sought a more detailed briefing on this specific aspect of the question, I will be happy to give that information if it is possible to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. As the minister is no doubt aware, concerns have been raised about the new charging regime for meat inspection services which came into effect on 1 January 1994. My question comes in two parts. First, what action does the government intend to take to address the concerns raised regarding the charging structure? Secondly, what does the government intend to do to ensure that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service operates in an efficient and cost-effective way?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="860" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy for his question and his courtesy in giving me notice that he would ask this question. This matter is of interest not just to members of the government but also to a number of senators in the opposition and Senator Woodley from the Australian Democrats. I have held a number of meetings over the last few weeks with interested senators on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of new meat inspection charges in January followed extensive consultation with industry bodies and consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. Notwithstanding this very exhaustive consultative process, there have been a number of concerns raised about the impact of the new charging regime, particularly on smaller operators. I might add that this problem occurred because the original proposal put forward by the government was for a three-tiered system that contained not just an establishment charge and an inspector charge but also a throughput charge that would have actually reflected the situation of the operators with a smaller turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was changed to the current two-tiered system as a result of representations that were received by that senate committee and by opposition senators. I have considered the concerns that have been raised about the impact on smaller operators and I have decided on certain changes to the previously announced registration charges. In fact, I discussed this matter just today with the shadow minister, John Anderson, prior to making this statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the reduction in rates for the 1993-94 financial year, I have determined that the revised six-monthly rate for 1993-94 will be maintained through to 31 December this year. Increases in establishment registration charges as from 1 July 1994, which had been foreshadowed in discussions with industry, will now not take place.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Boswell. This will allow the government a period to the end of calendar year 1994 in which to examine, in consultation with the industry, the whole question of inspection charges. I have asked AQIS to convene an industry charging review committee to consider further AQIS meat inspection costs and the appropriate charging structures and rates necessary to achieve appropriate cost recovery levels. Any new rates agreed will apply from 1 January 1995. There is a procedural matter in relation to the decision to reduce a number of the registration charges. The rules for the making and tabling of regulations require me to table the original regulations, which I will do today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose to table the new regulations by 24 March which will give effect to the changes I have outlined. As well, I am addressing the question of AQIS charges. I am also giving great priority to reducing AQIS costs. As the government announced in the 1993-94 budget, there is to be a major process of reform and efficiency improvement in AQIS. This process involves a restructuring of the Canberra office and regional support services. Efficiency measures in AQIS field services are also being developed. It is my intention to pursue these reforms vigorously. I will shortly be making a more detailed announcement on these matters. I table the revised charges.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind Senator Gareth Evans of the Prime Minister's now infamous comments on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program of 19 November 1992 when he emphatically stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what I am promising is not to put up tax..</PARA>
<PARA>I further remind the minister of the remarks of the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, on 14 November 1993, that he is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . opposed to future tax increases to meet the cost of any new obligations which come up.</PARA>
<PARA>I also remind the minister that, since becoming Treasurer, Mr Willis, on 23 December last, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . obviously the Government has no plans to raise taxes . . . ,</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we certainly would not be wanting to raise taxes. . . </PARA>
<PARA>So I ask: will the minister give the Australian people an assurance that this year's budget will honour the commitment of treasurers Dawkins and Willis and the commitments made to Australians by the Prime Minister and other senior ministers prior to the 1993 federal election, or will this budget simply be another round of deceptions and broken promises like the 1993 budget?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to one particular revenue measure&mdash;that is to say, the possibility of a jobs levy to fund work experience and training programs for the long-term unemployed&mdash;that prospect was canvassed in the green paper on employment opportunities. That is not new. There was a government document. That is out in the open and opposition senators know very well what the arguments are.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite properly, the green paper acknowledged that funding issues are a matter for separate government decision in the context of the budget and that is where that issue now remains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with every budget the government will, of course, give consideration to the need for revenue measures. Typically, any such consideration is given not at the outset but, rather, towards the end of the budget deliberations and, consistent with established practice, the government will not be commenting on specific tax proposals in advance of the budget. If those opposite can remember what it was like to be in government&mdash;and I know it is a long time, and I know it has escaped any residual memory that any of them on the front bench might have had&mdash;they would know that that is the position that any responsible government would adopt on any similar occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for the question and for drawing the articles in question to mind. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> and some honourable senators here have been running this issue for some time. It is not very hard to understand. The most basic logic or intellect would enable people to see there is some superficial, pseudoliberal-democratic attraction to that simple argument that the right to vote should entail the right not to vote.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston is wrong about that. He should go back to playing Torquemada and not worry about this. The fact of the matter is simply that the research on who does not vote is overwhelmingly clear, and it has been consistent throughout the world for as long as I can recall there being research. There is nothing recent, because all those people who do the research say it is a settled question. Everybody knows that it is people of lower socioeconomic status who do not vote; less well-educated people, blue-collar workers and the unemployed. People who have less contact with others in their immediate neighbourhood do not vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some people argue that it is in some way apathetic or less intelligent people who do not vote. I have to say that is a very insulting argument, but I do not attribute that to Senator Minchin, who has not said that. I have to say that I do not agree with his argument, but he has not made that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern is that these citizens are not voting, not through greater apathy but because these are the people who already feel excluded from the political system. These are the people who feel that the political system does not serve their interests. An agreement to go to voluntary voting would only reinforce that problem. It is reinforced doubly because these are the people who most need the assistance of government. It is inherent in the nature of a democratic political system that it responds to the active electorate. The skew in the political system would go disproportionately towards those who vote and to the interests of those who vote, and the political system would tend to get skewed away from those in greatest need of government policies. Those whom the policies are designed to serve are those least likely to be assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that this a profoundly disturbing trend. I would be shocked to think there are people advocating this policy for partisan advantage. I suspect that they would not dream of it; that everybody who advocates it would get partisan advantage from it is undoubtedly a coincidence. Notwithstanding that, the fact is that it is a fundamental question of principle; we should not allow the political system to develop in such a way that it ignores and underestimates the interests of those most in need of government assistance. That tends to disempower further those who are already feeling locked out of the political system. What is worse, there is a tendency to reinforce the power of special interest groups and the zealots. We can be sure that in the United States every member of the National Rifle Association votes, and that is one of the reasons why it has disproportionate power in the American political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think as a question of principle and as a question of serious consideration of the consequences of an action, it is irresponsible for any government and any participant in the political process who operates within a system of compulsory voting to be advocating turning the clock back to a system that advantages the already privileged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It relates to last night's ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. What independent oversight of ASIS currently exists? What is so unique about ASIS that, unlike ASIO, the CIA and MI6, it is exempt from all parliamentary scrutiny?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="863" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be understood in the light of various calls that have been made for judicial inquiries and so on into the various things that were said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last night and, indeed, in earlier newspaper articles, that there has been a very substantial judicial scrutiny of ASIS already in its recent history, beginning with the first Hope royal commission in 1977. That commission concluded that ASIS should continue as an organisation under the supervision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It also established some oversight machinery in the form of the permanent heads committee and the security committee of cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Hope royal commission that was set in train by the Labor government after coming into office in 1983 also scrutinised very minutely ASIS's operations as a result, in the first instance, of the Sheraton Hotel incident, which provoked and justified that degree of scrutiny. In Mr Justice Hope's report arising out of that second royal commission he addressed but rejected the notion of a parliamentary committee in favour of the proposal to establish an Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security&mdash;which I referred to in answer to an earlier question&mdash;which institution has in fact been in place since 1986, with a very full and wide-ranging brief to ensure not only that these agencies comply with their guidelines and statutory obligations and responsibilities, but also that they respect human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can confirm that under that legislation the inspector-general was given totally wide-ranging powers, including delving into any material he wants to within any of the organisations in order not only to redress particular grievances but also to see for himself how human rights standards, including privacy, are being maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Hope royal commission also specifically resulted in a clear government determination that ASIS would not hold weapons and not maintain a capability for special operations or special political action. It was not that ASIS ever had conducted those sorts of operations&mdash;notwithstanding a fair bit of public speculation and mythology to that effect&mdash;but the government did firmly rule them out from 1985 onwards, denying ASIS the means even to maintain such a capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the scrutiny provisions that operate in other countries, I think there has probably been some degree of misunderstanding about just how wide ranging those congressional and parliamentary oversight arrangements are. In the United Kingdom, for example, we are seeing right now the passage of an intelligence services act. It makes provision for the appointment of a commissioner who is equivalent, in effect, to our inspector-general, as I understand it, and the establishment of a tribunal to deal with the kinds of matters that have long been dealt with by us, for example, with our security appeals tribunal.It also establishes an intelligence and security committee of parliament jointly constituted from the House of Commons and the House of Lords whose oversight extends over the external intelligence agency in the UK, not just the internal one, and which might be thought to have some relevance as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be understood&mdash;and I do not think it is&mdash;is that that legislation specifically allows access by the committee to information to be prohibited in those circumstances where the head of the relevant security service involved certifies that the information is sensitive. And sensitive information includes, among other things, that which might lead to the identification of, or provide details of, sources of information or operational methods; information about particular operations which have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken; or information provided from another government unless that has been specifically cleared. In effect, there is a total capacity in the way the legislation is drawn to inhibit the access by that particular parliamentary committee to particular information or allegations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a report arising from this project announced by the Prime Minister in 1991. In fact, there has been a series of reports, but the report out today from a joint study by the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Business Council of Australia is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">International Performance Indicators: Overview</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly put, the reason for the government sponsoring this report is that with the phasing down of tariffs and the introduction of some transitory support schemes for industry, as we open the Australian economy to international competition in the traded goods area, there is a need also to make the non-traded goods area of the economy efficient and competitive. The way to do that is to push forward micro-economic reform, as the government has been vigorously doing, but to audit that against international benchmarks and against world best practice performance to demark the area in which Australian infrastructure and transport and communications industries can lift their game to the world best practice level so that the overall competitiveness of our economy is increased, not just that area affected by tariff changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have pursued a vigorous micro-economic reform agenda. What this report shows in five areas&mdash;electricity generation and distribution; rail freight; telecommunications; road freight; and the waterfront&mdash;is that, measured against both productivity gains and the list of costs to users, we have been successful in lifting the performance in those areas of the economy where we have pursued micro-economic reform; although in a salutary note the report also says that in many sectors of the economy there is a way to go before we get those sectors up to world best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked in the question whether I could give some indication of that. It has been discovered in this report that for commodities such as coal and wheat the Australian waterfront is performing at near or at world best practice. We are the best in the world, or very close to it, in terms of operating efficiencies. But Australian port authorities and ancillary coal handling charges are over eight times higher than those of our cheapest competitor, meaning that the costs to the users are higher. Australian industrial electricity prices were ranked as fourth cheapest in the OECD in 1990, but were still 40 per cent higher than our cheapest competitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarks in this report about telecommunications relate to a period before Optus came into competition with Telecom and therefore to an old competitive circumstance. I will not delay the Senate by referring to that. Road freight was found to be operating at close to world best practice in terms of price and reliability. Australian rail freight systems have improved both in labour and capital productivity, especially on the interstate network. State rail charges, however, are nearly twice as high as our most competitive rail system, Australian National, compared to US best practice rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also provides some interesting comparisons of performances between the states. For instance, on rail freight charges the New South Wales price per net transport kilometre is 50 per cent above the equivalent measure for Australian National. This sort of comparative benchmarking is a useful tool in spotlighting the deficiencies and measuring progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why these outcomes are evident are referred to in the report as a lack of competition in certain state-owned monopolies, the fact that the rate of change in demand is not adequate, or the fact that there is an inadequate use of technology in those particular areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The COAG meeting this Friday is, of course, an opportunity to consider the Hilmer report. The Hilmer report and the report that has just now been released, the one I referred to, relate to micro-economic reform changes necessary in the Australian economy and require a national response. The debate about this is concentrated on what the federal government is doing. The difference here is that it requires a national response and, therefore, all levels of government&mdash;federal, state and local&mdash;to contribute to lifting the level of competitiveness in Australia. Of course, the federal government wants to see the Hilmer report universally adopted by the states. That view is supported by the Business Council of Australia. Its President, Mr Ralph, said so much in a comment he made yesterday. But we want to see that, in cooperation with the states, we find a way of introducing true competition and, therefore, ensuring a more competitive and efficient economy and improving the overall competitiveness of Australia, not just at the federal level but nationally.</PARA></TALK.START>

As far as I know about the Altone Park development, Mrs Kelly informed shire officials that $250,000 would be allocated from the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program and the balance of the $1 million committed was to be met from funds allocated in the 1993 budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question. Medical research and the Therapeutic Goods Administration have recently identified 11 cases of severe allergic reaction, including the tragic death of an 11-year-old girl in Cooma and four life-threatening episodes, following the ingestion of royal jelly and royal jelly products. All cases occurred in people with a history of asthma or allergic reaction, and included 10 women and one man. Ten of the cases were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medical Journal</EMPHASIS> in November 1993 and January 1994. They are believed to be the first reported cases in the world linking the ingestion of royal jelly with severe allergic reaction in asthma or allergy sufferers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA has reviewed the clinical evidence and has determined that consumer safety requires the placement of warning labels on royal jelly products, recommending they should not be consumed by asthma and allergy sufferers. As some royal jelly products are classified as food items, the TGA has also coordinated its activities with the National Food Authority which is arranging for similar warnings to be included on such products. The Australian Association of Asthma Foundations, all consumer organisations and relevant industry and professional bodies are being advised of these developments, and their assistance is being sought to give very wide circulation to this information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medical research is being done also at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to identify the particular protein or proteins within royal jelly responsible for the allergic reaction. The TGA will continue to monitor the developments, and may have to vary its warning as the information emerges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be stressed too seriously that allergic reactions to products like royal jelly can be fatal. Sadly, that has already happened and we think it is very timely that a product warning be placed on any food product or therapeutic product containing royal jelly. The warning for therapeutic products will read, `Warning. This product contains royal jelly and is not recommended for asthma and allergy sufferers as it can cause severe allergic reactions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternative medicines and foods have a very significant market in this country, and the National Food Authority is concerned that people might be frightened off alternative preparations such as royal jelly, which is a very significant market spinner in that industry. However, I believe that the concerns of the industry are not significant or important enough to outweigh the government's concern that, if the warnings are not placed on products in the light of the evidence to hand, there may be more severe reactions or even fatalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This warning particularly alerts people with asthma or a history of allergy that there may be a danger if royal jelly is taken. It also advises people that one does not have to have a history to develop an allergy to some food products. So, while it gives good counsel to asthma and allergy suffers in particular, it is a warning to people in general to note the advice in relation to this product.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the late 1980s, a group of producers has continued to face difficulties in achieving long-term profitability but, on the other hand, indications are that many potential investors are benefiting from the build-up of property size and value-adding activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have one of the most efficient agricultural sectors in the world. The more efficient it becomes with the technological advances that are enjoyed by Australian primary industries, the build-up of land ownership will continue. With the continued efficiency provided by technological change and enhanced management techniques, the rural population will continue to decline from the historically high levels that it has enjoyed in the past. The recovery that we are generally experiencing domestically and the improved recovery that is being experienced around the world will improve the situation for Australian farmers. We can expect to see ongoing restructuring in rural industries, particularly among farmers who have longer-term profitability problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's support for the farmers whom Senator Woodley is concerned about is very significant. A major scheme has been offered. I think the wool industry is substantially happy with the achievements that this government has made in improvements in the wool industry, the achievements of which are particularly due to the efforts of the former minister, Mr Crean. The rural adjustment package is being funded this year to the tune of $170 million, which is a significant amount of support. As Senator Woodley would know, that is only one part of the picture. The drought-affected farmers in Queensland, for example, have received in excess of $20 million in direct assistance to enable them to cope with their problems. Indeed, cabinet approved a further $7 million at the beginning of this year for those particular farmers.</PARA>

We made it very clear at the time, though, that we were not going to solve the problems of western Sydney by compounding problems that exist in the western area of Melbourne. As such, with the planned relocation of the Coode Island facility to Point Wilson, we in the federal government said that that must have priority in the course of determining where we send the armaments depot. That is still our position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Victorian government will eventually make a decision, and publicly announce that decision, to go to Point Wilson, it will have right of way. But the secondary issue to that is this: we have been looking at whether it is possible to have either co-location or co-access to Point Wilson for the armaments depot. Even though technically it is probably feasible to have co-location, it is a very hard symbolic thing to sell to have a chemical complex on one side of the road and a safe ammunition depot on the other, even though every study might show that there is no chance whatsoever of an interaction between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are now looking at and hoping to discuss with the Victorian government in the next couple of weeks is co-access to a wharf and actually locating the two a reasonable distance apart so that no-one, no matter what conspiracy theories they may be indulging in, would be able to argue that there was any danger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week again the Victorian government fell back on the old canard that it cannot make a decision on Coode Island because the federal government has not finally made a decision on the east coast armaments complex.

If it did announce it tomorrow we would then seek to have studies made to determine whether co-access to the wharf is a feasible thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Horticulture is a key industry in Australia with 80,000 growers currently engaged in it and 11,500 people employed in processing. Its gross value of production is about $3 billion a year and it had exports of $646 million in 1991-92. But it is a highly fragmented industry with a very heavy domestic orientation and, with some notable exceptions, a generally poor export record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background and in light of the February 1993 Industry Commission report on horticulture, the government established a task force which was chaired by my colleague Senator Sherry. Its task was to consider future directions and to development industry strategy for growth. The task force has done that. It has clearly identified the potential and challenges for the horticultural industry. I commend the members of that task force and the chair, Senator Sherry, on producing an extremely useful and valuable report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential&mdash;outlined in that report&mdash;exists to triple the value of horticultural exports from Australia to approximately $2 billion by the year 2000, but this will not be achieved with the existing industry structures, the prevailing industry attitudes or the current regulatory arrangements. The task force has suggested in its 61 recommendations fundamental changes for the horticultural industry. It has identified the Australian Horticultural Corporation as the organisation that should be charged with driving these changes. Its role should become more commercially oriented, particularly in terms of industry adjustment, export market development and the domestic marketing and planning activities of participating industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force has also recommended the establishment of a strong industry identity and focus through nationally representative peak industry bodies. The government will give careful consideration to the 61 recommendations of the task force. Given the unprecedented change in our economy throughout the last decade, we will work with this particular industry to ensure a stronger and more internationally competitive future for this country. In conclusion, I table the report from the task force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bourne asked me a question about, among other things, parliamentary scrutiny of the CIA. I did not get time to respond to that part of the question then, but I do so now. The situation in the United States is that there are select committees on intelligence in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, together with Senate and House committees on appropriations. The appropriations committees, or the relevant subcommittees, leave detailed work, including on budgetary matters, to the operational committees, so the relationships with those committees are essentially formal in character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is quite a substantial working relationship with the two operational intelligence committees, and quite a lot of information is given. However, it is important to realise the limitations in the United States on the supply of information from the executive in sensitive matters. There is an agreed provision, for example, whereby, by presidential directive, sensitive operational material can be provided only to an inner group of the relevant congressional committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there is a further provision which is the result of the continuing stand-off between the congress and the executive in terms of legislation which embodies this or leaves it out, as the case may be, and that is a presidential directive whereby in extreme cases, where determined by the president in consultation with the cabinet committee, the congress is not to be advised, even in a limited fashion, about particular matters. The stand-off is a result of the fact that congress does not want such a provision, the executive has insisted on it, and the indications are that if ever it went to legislation, the legislation would be vetoed if it did not contain such an exceptional provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that points to the reality of very significant inherent limitations, even in a relatively apparently open system like the United States, which confront efforts to have parliamentary oversight of particularly sensitive intelligence operations. I have described the similar provisions which are there on the face of the legislation in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of the inherent limitations involved in any such parliamentary scrutiny that successive governments in Australia have taken the view that it is not especially helpful as a contribution to the oversight of ASIS in Australia, and that that oversight would be better exercised through, in particular, the machinery of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, together with the additional oversight that is exercised by the permanent heads committee of the intelligence community, and also the cabinet security committee. I think that gives additional&mdash;and hopefully helpful&mdash;background to Senator Bourne and anyone else interested in the policy of this matter.</PARA>

He attacked Professor Forbes on the radio this morning. I pulled the minister up this afternoon and he admitted that Professor Forbes is one of the leading researchers in Australia. Professor Forbes has been battering his head against government for years and years to get breast cancer on the agenda. As Senator Bishop said, $51 million was provided for AIDS research and $1.2 million goes from the National Health and Medical Research Council into breast cancer research, $750,000 of which goes to one institution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy in this country really is that for 40 years the mortality rate from breast cancer has not changed. The incidence is increasing. The paltry sum that the minister has announced will probably cope with only the number of extra women who are getting breast cancer in this country because of the ageing population. It is almost an epidemic; it is approaching that stage. In America, at the moment, one in nine women will get breast cancer in their lifetime. At the moment in Australia it is between one in 12 and one in 13 women. Within the next nine years, one in 10 women will get breast cancer in their lifetime.

The reason I did that was that breast cancer screening in this country fell way behind. We are about 10 years behind the countries that have instituted breast screening programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to taxation increases.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked Senator Evans today whether, on behalf of the government, he would give the Australian people an assurance that this year's budget will honour the commitments of the preceding Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and the current Treasurer, Mr Willis, and the commitments given by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, during the run-up to the 1993 federal election and since, that there will be no further tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To refresh the memory of the Senate on this, I suppose the most famous of all these statements was that of the Prime Minister on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program in November 1992, just three months before the election. He said `What I am promising is not to put up tax'. That came after statements made in the budget debate by, amongst others, the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. But on 16 September 1992, Mr Dawkins emphasised to parliament, `This will be achieved without resort to any new taxes'&mdash;`this' being the two-stage income tax cut being promised by the government at that time. He also said, `We can pay for our personal income tax cuts'. The saga went on and on and eventually the promise was broken&mdash;very rapidly in fact&mdash;in the 1993 budget when the proposed second stage of cuts did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was those tax cuts that the government had run to the election on. When the Prime Minister was questioned about the matter he arrogantly said, `Look, those cuts are legislated. They are law; l-a-w, law'. What he really meant was that they were `Lie; l-i-e, lie', because that is precisely what happened. The Prime Minister and the government lied their way into office with such promises which they broke as soon as they were elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, himself is on very shaky ground in this area. Only six months ago, on 5 October 1993, he told the Senate that the government would not `go down the path of introducing new taxes'. He probably thought he was in pretty good company because at around that time the then Treasurer had said in the parliament that he was&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">opposed to future tax increase to meet the cost of any new obligations which come up. See my job&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as resisting any claims for tax increases. . . my view is to say if there are new things to spend money on we have to adjust priorities to accommodate them. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Willis, the Treasurer who succeeded Mr Dawkins, just a couple of months after that, on 23 December, said, `Obviously the government has no plan to raise taxes, and we certainly would not be wanting to raise taxes'. In my question today I asked Senator Evans whether the government would stick by those commitments. He refused to give such a commitment; he was totally equivocal about it. Indeed, he gave a quite extraordinary answer. He said, `Oh well, there was a possible jobs levy but we would not count that', and left it at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises two fundamental questions. I am glad to see that Senator Evans is here at the moment. I hope he will respond to these two questions that automatically flow from that incredible answer. The first question is this: does he not regard a job levy, or a levy, as a tax? It would appear from what he said today that he does not regard a levy as a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I put to him, and I hope he is listening and will respond, is this: even setting aside that aspect, is he or is he not saying that there will be no new additional taxes? That is a question that the Senate and the Australian people demand an urgent answer to. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government policy on taxes was, as Mr Keating said, not to raise taxes, to keep taxes as they were. Senator Ray went around the electorate, as did Senator Evans who is in the chamber now, assuring people that there would be no tax rises under this government. So we went to the election and, as a result of the promise that was made by Mr Keating, the government managed to sneak into office. As soon as they got into office, Mr Keating and his colleagues set about breaking the fundamental promise they had made to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had an astonishing performance from Senator Evans. We now know that Senator Evans is not talking about a tax increase but that he is calling the tax increase a levy. So when is a tax rise not a tax rise? Apparently when it is a levy. Later on in question time, as he stumbled around trying to explain to Senator Short why the government was not keeping its promises, Senator Evans said that it was not a tax rise but a financing mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is: may we be saved from further levies and financing mechanisms, because the government's broken tax promises have already cost the Australian electorate an additional $3 billion in a full year. If Mr Keating had been honest with the Australian people and gone to the electorate and said, `We are going to raise taxes across a vast series of areas, including fuel taxes, fuel excises, sales taxes and so forth', does anyone believe that this government would have been elected to office? Of course it would not have been. The government deliberately denied that there would be any possibility of a tax rise. Indeed, as my colleague Senator Short pointed out, the government promised tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator Short has drawn attention to a really fundamental issue&mdash;that this government lied its way into office and, within months of winning an election on the promise that there would be no tax increases, it increased taxes by some $3 billion. After that, in order to try to quieten public concern, Mr Willis made an announcement. Does Senator Evans remember all the newspaper headlines about no more tax rises? It took only a few months for that further promise to be broken. Senator Evans is quite right to feel embarrassed about this. I know he does not want to use the words `tax rise'; he would prefer to the use the word `levy'. But, at the end of the day, it is the Australian people who will pay and pay dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this government has broken its fundamental promise to the Australian people. I believe the Australian people understand that. That is why Mr Keating has no moral authority whatsoever in this country. Senator Evans gets up and tries to lecture people about standards and morals. We know that it is Senator Evans who, day after day, has to defend the big lie of Australian politics made before the 13 March election that the Labor Party would not increase taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support what my colleagues Senator Short and Senator Kemp have said in response to Senator Gareth Evans's answer to Senator Short's question asked earlier today. As my colleagues have said, potential tax increases are really a serious matter for the Australian community. The Australian community has been misled by the government. The really serious issue for the longer term future is that, whilst the Australian economy is now recovering, business investment has not recovered. It is business investment which sets the scene, not for tomorrow but for a few years time when we get into the next dip in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this chamber several times, it is a fact that investment in plant and equipment of less than six per cent of GDP is the lowest rate since World War II. Whilst the Treasury figures which came out this week show that the rate has risen marginally for the latest quarter, it is still nowhere near the amount that is required over the next several years to sustain this economy and provide jobs for our children and grandchildren. We have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A jobs levy&mdash;a financing mechanism, as Senator Evans calls it&mdash;would really be another impediment to investors considering investing in Australia today. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the Managing Director of ICI Australia made the point that his industry is ready to spend billions of dollars in setting up and expanding chemical exports, provided that the impediments to those investments are considered by government and removed. One of the points he made was that the government ought to consider giving a five per cent tax rebate to make up for the indirect taxes which businesses pay in this economy. But this government increased indirect taxes in the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst those opposite mouth all the rhetoric about being concerned about jobs and being concerned about the community, the actual fact is that they are doing exactly the reverse. This matter is very serious. My colleagues and I are against any increases in taxes.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Harradine is totally familiar with these issues. There is a threshold question, as a matter of constitutional law and as a matter of Senate practice, as to whether a particular revenue measure is properly describable as a tax or whether it is properly describable as a fee, a charge or a levy. When a revenue measure is selective in its application&mdash;not of general application to the community as a whole but with a particular target group&mdash;it is very often appropriate to describe it not as a tax at all but as a levy or in some other way, such as a fee or a charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I make no judgement as to whether a jobs levy, if it were to be introduced, would properly be described as a tax. That might be a matter for argument around the place but it is certainly not a matter for assumption on the part of the opposition. That is the first point I was seeking to make, and that is not a matter for jocularity, parody or anything else; it is just a matter for plain, straightforward understanding on the opposition's side, which is a little bit much to ask for, I know, but I do ask for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is whether or not one is introducing a new tax and what we may have said on the subject of new taxes. I do not think the Prime Minister was ever explicit in ruling out new taxes as such&mdash;`no new taxes'. The Treasurer was on one occasion in August 1992, I think before the budget, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not be introducing new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>What precisely the context of that particular remark was I am not sure&mdash;whether he was saying so in the context of that budget or purporting to offer a promise more generally; one would have to see the context of the remark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly my own remark on 5 October, which has been quoted today, that the government would not be going down the path of introducing new taxes was simply, again, descriptive of the situation as it stood after the last budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just a matter of understanding what I am saying and not making up what I am saying and not injecting any more content into it than actually existed. That is what I want to say on the subject of new taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the context of the last election, before the last election there was one new tax that we were very specifically ruling out and we made that absolutely clear, and that was a GST. Senator Short must wish in retrospect that he had made a similar commitment. He might be doing a little bit better now than he was at the time or is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question&mdash;and it is a distinct one again&mdash;is not whether one is introducing a new tax but whether one is increasing an existing tax. On this there is a lot of argument backwards and forwards about what was said before the last election in that respect. The point to be made once again in this regard&mdash;and we made it on innumerable occasions&mdash;is that the Labor government did not rule out before the last election or at any time subsequently the possibility from time to time of there being revenue increases. What we did rule out was any increase in the overall burden of taxation. Right at the very beginning&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> contribution of the Prime Minister on 19 November&mdash;the context of his response to Mr O'Brien on that occasion made that absolutely clear. He did say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what I'm promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>But that was immediately after a sentence in which he said that his object and the government's object was to maintain the tax to GDP ratio that we roughly have at the moment. He said that our object was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to maintain the tax to GDP ratio we roughly have at the moment. In other words, what I'm promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators opposite and I know that what he was saying was that there would be no increase in the overall burden&mdash;the tax to GDP proportion&mdash;and that is exactly what we are delivering on because the burden throughout the 1980s of tax to GDP was of the order of 23 or 24 per cent and in our particular projections&mdash;and all these figures have been on the public record before and debated in this place&mdash;we are anticipating no more than that, getting up to about 23 1/2 per cent by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a difference between new taxes and existing taxes and there is a difference between not increasing a tax and increasing an existing tax; and, understood in the way that I have stated, there is absolutely no inconsistency in anything the government has said, and certainly no deception of the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, except for that sentence, the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> is a very fair account. Similarly, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> there were various assessments made by the writer. But it is not true that I had said that the actual submission of the RSL was deceitful or untrue. I said that it was a most surprising submission which included a number of most unfortunate Aunt Sallies and one area which, in my view, was plainly wrong, but the articles took my criticisms of the RSL's submission and put them in words which were not my own words. I mention this because it was brought to my attention this morning that there was this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, much of which is built around my so depicting the RSL submission. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that they, or the RSL's national president Major-General "Digger" James, could put their names to a document that is "deceitful and untrue" is simply ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA>I make the point again that I did not say that the submission was deceitful or untrue. To make it quite clear, the particular sentence in the RSL's submission that I took grave exception to and which I claim to be wrong states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recruit or train a military force and then to recoil in horror when its members occasionally exhibit unseemly aggressiveness or even brutality towards one another is either deceitful or stupid and certainly unfair to the general membership of the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA>I regard that statement as most unfortunate. No-one in the RSL has reiterated those words, I am grateful to say, but it could not stand without criticism. I believe it is quite wrong for the RSL, or anyone, to believe that the Australian Defence Force recruits only aggressive people, as though they are a small minority of the Australian public, and then to excuse sexual assault or other brutality between individual members and claim that this is the natural outcome of aggressive people having been recruited to the defence service. I hope that my personal clarification puts the real problem all the more in focus, and not some words which I did not use of the submission. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, has had, amongst other things, the effect of linking the basic salary levels for parliamentarians to the top of the senior executive service band one level in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>

Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act the government set in train arrangements to ensure that the relativities established between the salaries of parliamentarians at that time are maintained. That is, ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time that salaries of senators and members of the parliament increase. Ministers receive the same increase in additional salaries as members of the parliament and are phased in the same way. Increases of the same order and timing for office-holders of the parliament, including the opposition leadership, derive from the Remuneration and Allowances Act and funds for those increases are appropriated by that act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In question time today the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) used a dorothy dixer from his former colleague in the west, Senator Chris Evans, to defend the ALP's position on compulsory voting. It is incredible how sensitive the ALP has become on this issue. This is the second time since July that the ALP has used the forum of the parliament to defend its position on compulsory voting. It would appear the ALP is well aware that it is starting to lose the argument on this very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan used the argument about how voluntary voting would disenfranchise the underprivileged, as though the opposition was suggesting that people should be denied the right to vote. He dismissed arguments about voluntary voting as first-year philosophy arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is one of naked ALP self-interest about compulsory voting. The ALP has a vested interest in retaining compulsory voting because it believes it gets a very significant advantage from the system of forcing people to vote. It is terrified that its own core voters would not vote if they were not forced to the polls; that is what this issue is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan tries to dress it up with arguments about disenfranchising people, and saying that this is really not an issue that we should be addressing. This is really all about the fear that is struck into the heart of the ALP about the notion that people might have the right not to vote. It is very interesting that a former adviser to Mr McMullan, one Rod Cameron, hailed as the ALP's greatest asset through the 1980s as their researcher, is probably Australia's most passionate advocate of voluntary voting. He realises the stupidity of forcing people to vote who have absolutely no interest in election outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony on our side is that there are some Liberals who believe that the ALP would be the beneficiary of having voluntary voting. I have arguments with some on my side who say that the ALP would be better at getting out the vote. That only demonstrates that on our side it is a matter of principle. We genuinely believe that the right to vote must entail the right not to vote. The ALP does not have one shred of principle on which to stand on this issue. Its self-interest is utterly naked. Its attitude to underprivileged voters is utterly condescending and contemptuous. The tragedy is that the ALP thinks it has to force its own voters to the polls or it will lose elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP never mentions in this debate the fact that the overwhelming number of democracies in the world do not force their voters to vote. We are the only English speaking democracy that does so. We are one of only five countries in the world that I can find that forces voters to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan dismisses the right not to vote as a first-year philosophy argument. I remind him that in 1970 Holland changed from compulsory to voluntary voting for the very reason that for years some of the most eminent people in Holland had considered this issue. They reported to the Dutch parliament that, as a matter of high principle, the right to vote must entail a right not to vote. As a result Holland got rid of compulsory voting, leaving Australia now as one of the very few countries to retain this very undemocratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP also fails to mention that, in the overwhelming majority of countries that have voluntary voting, voter turnout is around 80 per cent&mdash;eight out of 10 voters choose to exercise their right to vote and turn out to vote. The United States of America is often cited by Labor activists as an example of what happens under voluntary voting. But it is the great exception to the rule: for a whole variety of reasons that are inherent to the US it has a low voter turnout. Voluntary voting in the United States tells us that there are real problems with the American political system, and that is why people are not turning out to vote. American political commentators know their system is sick because of that low turnout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP also fails to acknowledge that almost every analysis of the United Kingdom and United States experience with voluntary voting shows that, for every election studied since World War II, there would have been no change in election outcomes if the polls had been conducted by compulsory voting. It simply would not have changed the outcome of national elections held in those countries since the war. A further irony is that under voluntary voting in America the Democrats, the soul brothers of the Labor Party, have an iron grip on the house of representatives, and have had such a hold for 40 years. So voluntary voting is hardly disenfranchising the core vote of the Democrats in that country and what would be the core vote of the Labor Party in this country. It is tragic that the Labor Party has this perception that it would suffer from giving the people the right not to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in Australia is that, frankly, until now there has been a cosy conspiracy between the parties about compulsory voting. It has been easier for the major parties to have the law force people to exercise their franchise. In other words, the responsibility is taken away from the parties to persuade people of the virtues of exercising their right to vote. That means that we have an electoral system where the total focus is on a handful of swinging voters in a handful of swinging seats. Due to compulsory voting the great majority of voters in this country have almost nothing to do with the political process because they can safely be ignored by the major parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major parties should have the responsibility of persuading voters of the virtues of voting, and if they do not then they will pay the price. It would rejuvenate the sick position of the voluntary organisations of our political parties in Australia&mdash;organisations that are in a poor state. This would give organisations a real purpose, a necessity to get out into otherwise safe seats and persuade voters of the need to vote. Compulsory voting is wrong in principle and wrong in practice. It is about time the ALP faced up to the need to give voters the right not to vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to deal with the government's intended review of the link between population growth and development. Unfortunately, that has now become an expensive exercise with predictable conclusions if the expressed views of the participants are any guide. The Senate will recall that in this chamber, on 27 October 1993, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we proposed that an appropriate development economist&mdash;someone with an international reputation who is fully independent and has no axe to grind on these matters in issue&mdash;be asked to spend a few months reviewing the available evidence as to the nature of the relationship between the variables I have mentioned and reporting to the government on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA>That was after the budget included a proposal by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Mr Bilney, for a threefold increase in funds for population programs and a fivefold increase over a period of four years. Incidentally, this money will be diverted from other development cooperation programs in an already very low overseas official development assistance budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided that a review and assessment be undertaken of the literature relating to population growth and development and that that be conducted by an internationally recognised development economist. Initially, I welcomed an objective analysis of the intellectual underpinning of government policy in this area. Actually, I had raised this matter and questioned AIDAB representatives on these issues over a period of time in estimates committees. The Senate will recall that on 7 October 1993, I told the Senate that, if the government were serious about its deficit reduction strategy, it was inappropriate for a minister to commit this sort of expenditure on controversial policies for more than a short period and certainly not for a four-year period, well beyond the term of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it was claimed by some sections of the media that the person chosen for the review would have to meet my approval, this was never and is certainly not the case. The appropriate development economist whom Senator Evans envisaged would spend, in his words, `a few months reviewing the available evidence' has turned into nine people, each one to contribute a chapter in a book. Those nine people are all, except one, working in American institutions; and the exception is working in a UK institution. Surely to goodness there are world renowned development economists working in Australia. Yet none of these were appointed to conduct the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the structure of the inquiry nor most of its participants meet the criteria proposed by the government itself, expressed by Senator Evans on 27 October. I invite honourable senators to read what he said and see whether the new structure and most of the participants meet that criteria. If there was to be a change of structure, if there was to be a review conducted by a number of people, why were not scholars with well-argued differing viewpoints invited to contribute? They have not been invited to contribute. Yet here we have $320,000 of aid money being spent by the government on this particular inquiry which does not meet the criteria nor the structure as originally announced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter that I received from Mr Bilney's office dated 15 February, my office was told that, `The government was careful to select in-dependent specialists who were internationally well-regarded to undertake the inquiry'. Yet the minister had told me a couple of weeks ago that he had not heard of most of the appointees. They were appointed by Professor Ahlburg, the principal reviewer. Therefore, the minister had not heard of them, let alone understood their expressed views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government stated that the consultant to be involved in the review was to have no axe to grind, the positions of most of the appointees require defence. Research carried out by my office shows that most of the appointees have a public position of support for population programs of the type proposed by AIDAB, for which there was a substantial increase in the recent budget, and for the next three successive budgets, and which expenditure should have been the subject of this review. Yet most of them are supporting those particular programs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most serious flaws with the review is the failure to have a person of international stature examining the human rights implications of population programs. From a survey of written work, it seems Dr. Karen Oppenheim-Mason, who will be writing the "human rights" chapter of the review, has not had a prominent role in subjecting coercive population control programs to scrutiny. She is involved in a project relating to "Women and Development" funded by the Rockefeller Foundation&mdash;an institution with a long history of support for population programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument of the population controllers and their political supporters has been that rapid population growth is a crucial negative factor in the economic development of developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a number of years now, both inside and outside the Parliament, I have publicly challenged those assertions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the 1993/94 budget was announced it contained a three-fold increase in finance for population programs for 93/94 over the previous year and a five-fold increase over four years. This is at a time when the ratio of Official Development Assistance to Gross National Product is, except for one year, at an all time low. This will result in the transfer of funds from poverty alleviation and development co-operation to international population bureaucracies and population control programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increased spending on population control was introduced at a time when the Government had embarked on a deficit reduction strategy which included increases in indirect taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On October 7, 1993, I told the Senate that if the Government were serious about a deficit reduction strategy it was inappropriate for a Minister to commit this sort of expenditure on controversial policies for more than a short period&mdash;and certainly not for a four year period, well beyond the term of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suggestion to test the assumptions upon which the Minister proposed such an increase was made by the Government. The Government decided that a review be undertaken of the literature relating to population growth and development to be conducted by an internationally recognised development economist who did not have a public position to defend, or in the words of Foreign Minister Senator Evans, no axe to grind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I initially welcomed an objective analysis of the intellectual underpinning for policy in this area, having urged it at Senate Estimates Committee meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the structure of the "inquiry" as now constituted, nor most of its participants meet the criteria proposed by the Government itself and expressed to the Senate by Senator Evans on 27 October 1993, as follows :</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . we proposed that an appropriate development economist&mdash;someone with an international reputation who is fully independent and has no axe to grind on these matters in issue&mdash;be asked to spend a few months reviewing the available evidence as to the nature of the relationship between the variables I have mentioned and reporting to the government on that issue."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "appropriate development economist" whom Senator Evans envisaged would spend a few months reviewing the available evidence has turned into nine people&mdash;each one to contribute a chapter in a book. This was not the original intention as stated in the Senate on October 27. With the change in structure why were not scholars with well argued differing viewpoints invited to contribute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Development and Pacific Island Affairs, the Hon Gordon Bilney, has appointed as team leader, Professor Dennis Ahlburg of the University of Minnesota, a long-time consultant with the World Bank who has expressed views in support of population programs of a type proposed for the Pacific by AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Ahlburg has contracted eight people to assist with the review, most of whom have publicly stated positions in support of population programs. Although the Government stated the consultant to be involved in the review was to have "no axe to grind" the positions of most of the appointees are ones which require defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter from Minister Bilney's office dated February 15, I was told that "the Government was careful to select independent specialists who are internationally well regarded to undertake the inquiry." Yet the Minister had already told me he had not heard of many of the appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My office is currently in the process of a search of the written views of the appointees. A large number of articles have been received and more are coming. It is also receiving information from international contacts as to the otherwise expressed views of the appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those whom Ahlburg has appointed to provide the chapters on housing and health have published positions which require defence. In that sense they have an axe to grind or an intellectual sand castle to defend, and should not have been appointed. The Minister was not aware of their published positions prior to their appointments;  I have had searches done and although the appointees were little known, what was known shows that they support population programs of the type proposed by AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no credible development economist who would now say that population growth is a necessary crucial negative factor in economic development. As to food, agricultural scientists and the World Bank point out that agriculture prices are at their lowest level in history and that world food production is rising faster than population. Hunger does exist among plenty; people are living in extreme poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that population has to be controlled to achieve economic development has always been dubious.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been one basic theme to the argument:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By reducing population growth countries can increase savings for investment and thus achieve a sustained take off to higher economic growth rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has led to corollaries such as</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Countries should not subsidise families through family allowance programs since these have the effect of increasing the rate of population growth;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Countries should use so-called non-coercive incentives such as cash payments, priority for housing and schooling etc for parents with fewer children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking the fundamental argument first, at its most simplistic it seems to assume that output is fixed and that by reducing the numbers of the population, we can produce a greater output per head.  This is obvious nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it ignores the greater efficiencies in production which can arise through specialisation which becomes possible in serving larger markets. How often, for example, do we hear that the Australian market is too small for our companies and that they must expand overseas to keep up with best world practice?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, even if it were true that simply cutting numbers increased output per head, who should the population planners cut? The young or the aged or the mentally and physically disabled?  From their pseudo-rational utilitarian viewpoint, the planners might find a greater so-called economic return by culling those who are longer productive rather than potential workers and taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes the argument is a little more sophisticated. For example, Andrew Mason, one of the persons chosen for this review, has advanced the argument that a demographic transition from a high fertility high mortality population to a low mortality low fertility population creates an opportunity for economic growth. Because families pass through a phase where there are few elderly dependants and few child dependants and the past baby boom is of working age, a developing country may be able to increase its savings and investment. This is supposed to lead to a permanently increased rate of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus in his co-authored study on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Population Growth and Economic Development: Lessons from Selected Asian Countries</EMPHASIS>  at pp 54-55 the statements are made that "Efforts to reduce fertility have immediately reduced the number of child dependants without reducing the number of adults of working age. The result has been a rapid increase in per capita income for three reasons: (1) fewer children has meant fewer mouths to feed; (2) fewer children has enabled more women to enter the labour force; and (3) fewer children has led to lower aggregate consumption, higher saving, and additional investment in physical capital. . . . . As the [demographic] transition is completed, labour force growth slows and savings rates return to lower levels, the rate of economic growth should return to rates not substantially different from those observed prior to the transition . . . family planning efforts apparently have been successful in bringing down birth rates. This externally induced decline in fertility has had an important bearing on . . . the size and productivity of their labour force, the level of saving, and the growth of per capita and total product. Thus the evidence presented here indicates that the rapid pace of economic growth is, in part, a consequence of successful family planning efforts."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the sorts of economic models used by writers such as Andrew Mason suffer from the same problems as the sorts of models used by the Treasury and the Reserve Bank in giving Australia the greatest recession since World War II. These models do not project far enough into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as there can be a favourable demographic pattern for a time, so it can change to an unfavourable one. Japan, Germany, most of Europe, the USA and Australia are experiencing the economic strains of ageing populations. With unfunded social security spending and a declining base of taxpaying younger workers, the treasuries of most advanced countries are facing a perpetual battle for solvency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As tax rates are increased to make up the revenue, fewer taxpayers can afford to raise children and more emigrate or simply evade taxes. History may not repeat itself, but depopulation seems to be creating a situation of flux in Europe not seen since the days of the later Roman Empire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a very real sense, the measured economic growth from having fewer children and more investment is a statistical illusion. The concept of gross domestic product by definition excludes human capital. The birth of a pig is seen as a positive, the birth of a child is not. But if we consider human capital as a resource similar to physical capital the concept of GDP changes completely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example economists have suggested that investment in human capital in the USA dwarfs investment in physical capital. If we are to believe most economic writers, human capital is crucial to economic growth and competitiveness. If it were not we would hardly be spending so much on education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you cannot have investment in human capital without parents investing their time and energy in rearing children. When we take human capital into account we see that the so-called economic growth is a shift from investing in people to, at best, investing in  plant and equipment. But the apparent increase in physical capital may not even be enough. The growth in incomes per head may even be frittered away in higher consumption, as many of today's workers expect someone else's children to pay the taxes to support them in old age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anyone doubts the primacy of human capital over physical capital in development, look at Japan and Germany from 1945 to 1960. The physical destruction of the greatest war in history was overcome well within a generation. As John Stuart Mill observed the knowledge and skills of the people of a country are more important than its stock of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another statistical illusion used in promoting the benefits of population control programs is the suggestion that GDP is increased by increased female labour force participation when they have fewer children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first error in this assertion is to ignore the disutility of labour&mdash;a woman may be happier not being in the paid labour force and enjoying her children. Second, the shift of work out of the home into the factory does not necessarily mean increased economic welfare. A poor woman in the developing world who works in a factory and pays for baby formula instead of breastfeeding is increasing GDP per head but her family's welfare may be reduced rather than increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with Professor Mason and his colleagues is in the assumptions of their models. It is bad enough when economic modellers inflict recession on us: but playing with demography may be a terminal disease for nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corollary of the view that population growth needs to be reduced to improve economic growth is the suggestion, made by Dr. Cynthia Lloyd, another of the appointees (in her article <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Economic Analysis of the Impact of Government on Fertility: Some Examples from the Developed Countries </EMPHASIS>in vol 22 of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public Policy</EMPHASIS> (1974) pp 489-512) that "any government of a developing country seeking to introduce programs designed to reduce population growth would do well to consider all available means of increasing the direct and/or indirect cost of children as currently perceived by couples in the reproductive age group." (at p 507).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr. Lloyd suggests that "in all developed countries of the world, costs of children would be even higher than they now are were it not for extensive subsidies to children in the form of family allowances . . . ."  She even describes tax allowances for dependants as child subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the facts seem to have got overlooked. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in its fiscal incidence analysis has shown that most families pay their own way&mdash;by and large two parent couples with children receive no net subsidy from the Treasury. She is also wrong in describing child tax allowances as a subsidy&mdash;they are no more a subsidy than the tax free threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So talk of non-coercive inducements to parents by way of fiscal penalties or bribes is wide of the mark. It is coercive to tax people without regard to dependants and then offer them a so-called subsidy paid for out of their own money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes advocacy of family planning occurs without any real analysis in support of the proposal. For example, Professor Mark Montgomery, another of the appointees, in a chapter on "Accommodating Urban Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa" in a World Bank Symposium on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Population Growth and Reproduction in Sub-Saharan Africa </EMPHASIS>urges the need for "concerted efforts toward family planning" to lower urban growth. Yet, unlike the rest of the chapter, which analyses economic arguments for correcting distortions in the financing of urban infrastructure and labour market imperfections, no real evidence or analysis is offered in support of the a priori policy conclusion in favour of birth control. He does not explain why or how couple's fertility decisions are distorted or why governments have superior knowledge to decide optimum fertility decisions for their peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sometimes those who advocate population control programs seem to think they know better than the people themselves about what they need. For example Professor Ian Diamond, the appointee to contribute the chapter on family planning, has stated that in Botswana "ideal family size remains high. . . . the mean ideal family size for all women was 4.7 children; for those in a union the ideal was 5.4. It should be an early goal of the population policy to reduce this figure if a sustained fertility decline is to occur. . . . " (Naomi Rutenberg and Ian Diamond <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fertility in Botswana: The Recent Decline and Future Prospects</EMPHASIS> Demography vol 30 No 2 May 1993 p 155).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only does it seem somewhat out of place for an Englishmen in this post-colonial era to be musing about an apparent need to persuade black Africans to stop breeding, but one wonders how these poor black people are to be reprogrammed. What if they don't want to change?  It is a short step from this sort of sentiment to coercive target driven population control programs and the abuses of human rights they necessarily entail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most serious flaws with the review is the failure to have a person of international stature examining the human rights implications of population programs. From a survey of written work, it seems Karen Oppenheim-Mason, who will be contributing the "human rights" chapter for the review, has not had a prominent role in subjecting coercive population control programs to scrutiny. She is involved in a project relating to "Women and Development" funded by the Rockefeller Foundation&mdash;an institution with a long history of support for population programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government acknowledges the rights of couples to choose freely the number of children they have. It has stated it will not support coercive programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">R.E Stenshold, Assistant Director General Appraisal, Evaluation and Sectoral Studies Branch, AIDAB has stated: "It is Australian policy that aid is directed only to international organisations that fully respect the rights and beliefs of the peoples they serve."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the violation of human rights inherent in many population programs is a pressing issue requiring serious attention, a person of international repute should have been appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central point of this inquiry is supposed to be a review of relevant literature on the question of population and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will this "review of the literature" include the work of women, particularly those in developing countries, who have condemned population programs as racist, eugenic, anti-women and anti-poor?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will  "Reproductive Rights and Wrongs: The global Politics of Population Control and Contraceptive Choice" by Betsy Hartmann be read and noted? Hartmann states in that book: "the complexities of the argument and the wide variation in opinion have largely been screened from public view."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope the "complexities of the argument" and the "wide variation in opinion" will not be screened by the academic appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what about other literature documenting the violation of human rights inherent in target-driven population programs funded by the Australian taxpayer?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What of the book: "Imperialism and the Control of Women's Fertility: New hormonal contraceptives, Population control and the World Health Organisation" by the Amsterdam-based Indian women's health activist Sumati Nair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In it, Nair documents the development and trials of new long-acting provider controlled contraceptives and the Anti-HcG vaccine. Does the Senate know that International Planned Parenthood Federation and the World Health Organisation have approved and recommended Norplant for general "contraceptive" use in family planning programs while admitting that not enough is known about the long-term effects of this contraceptive?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She writes of "the misery and suffering" caused by contraceptive testing, and the inundation of unsafe hormonal contraceptives in a context of an inadequate health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The book condemns the World Health Organisation's Special Program for Research Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP). She writes that WHO is merely promoting the interests of the population control lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what about the written work against the anti-HCG vaccine&mdash;which works not by preventing conception, but by making a woman's immune system produce antibodies to attack the embryo. Will this critical material merit attention for the review panel? Will the panel note that this vaccine is currently being trialled on women in third world countries in the absence of informed consent? Who's helping fund the trials of this vaccine? Australia. And who helped develop it in the first place in collaboration with the WHO? Australia's very own professor Warren Jones. And why does Professor Jones think this vaccine is such a great achievement? I quote from an article in the West Australian May 31, 1990: "He said it would be vital in controlling the world's swelling population.." and in an AAP article: "On Current Statistics, overpopulation threatens to be the real misery of the world&mdash;it makes the AIDS problem look like a tea party."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps Third World women's activists are right to feel that the new provider controlled contraceptives and abortifacients are not designed to empower them or raise their status, but to control them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other books I could mention. "Norplant: Under her Skin" produced by the Women and Pharmaceutical Project in the Netherlands documenting field studies by women's groups in Indonesia, Finland, Brazil, Thailand and Egypt; "A Question of Control" by Health Action International; and the many publications put out by the development policy organisation UBINIG in Bangladesh opposing population control programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there's the banned book which I have referred to in this chamber before. "The Right to Reproduce: A History of Coercive Sterilization" by Stephen Trombley. The review team should take a look at that one, but they'll be lucky to find a copy. It's no longer on sale thanks to threatened libel action the International Planned Parenthood. The IPPF didn't like references to funding by large US corporations, nor did it take kindly to a critical light being shed on it's anti-fertility activities in the Third World. So much for freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then of course is the work of the China expert Dr. John S. Aird who has collected a remarkable amount of documentation from sources within China on the workings of the coercive one-child policy. Those of you who were concerned enough would have read the document John Aird produced for this chamber titled:"Foreign Assistance to Coercive Family Planning in China" which I tabled in May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if the team is at all concerned with upholding human rights, then it must read the latest book by Steven Mosher "A Mother's Ordeal." Anyone attempting to maintain the myth that China's population control program is not coercive; anyone who thinks that forced abortions up to the ninth month of pregnancy; forced sterilisations, fines, punishments, and discrimination against "illegal" children are not a daily fact of life for the people of China, needs to read this book.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In appointing the nine academics to conduct the review, the Government seemed to forget this country's "Buy Australian" campaign. A total of $320,000 of Australian aid money is being spent on academics (sight unseen) in American universities and population centres. Not one cent is provided to development economists in Australian institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the background and the expressed views of the participants, I hope I am not being unduly cynical in suspecting that the outcome of this review will be that there is no proof that population growth is a necessary crucial negative factor in economic development, population growth is substantially the cause of environmental degradation, ill health, low housing etc and therefore more money from international organisations and world governments should be provided to meet an unmet demand for contraception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the so called "right to contraception" eclipse the basic human right to form and found a family and the rights of couples to determine family size without the interference of the State?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will it eclipse the right of women to exercise free and informed consent before having dangerous long-acting contraceptive and abortifacient drugs injected into them?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the review team put forward real alternative policies to the mass dumping of contraceptives on the developing world?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will it tackle the real reasons for maternal mortality, such as respiratory diseases, parasitic infections, genital mutilation, shocking hospital conditions, anaemia, malnourishment and lack of vaccination, transport and diagnosis facilities for difficult births&mdash;often first births.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ehrlich theories have been proven wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world has not run out of food. The real cost of food has fallen and most countries are seeing a surplus of labour arising in agriculture. Indeed, as we know in Australia, commodity prices for agricultural produce have tended to be depressed by glut than driven up by scarcity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor has the evidence shown that population growth is a crucial negative for economic development. On the contrary, there are plenty of examples of territories with both rapid population growth proceeding in tandem with rapid economic growth. For example, Hong Kong, has coped with a huge expansion of its population since World War II while raising living standards dramatically. Malaysia has experienced strong economic growth at the same time as its population is advancing. Few economists would now assert that rapid population growth as such is a negative for economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The population controllers continue to pile up more reasons to justify their interventions. Not only is the fertility of poor women in poor countries now to blame for slow economic growth, it is also responsible for other problems, particularly environmental degradation, poor health and poor housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the fertility of poor women from poor countries continues to be blamed for these situations, target driven programs will continue to be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But here again they fail to look deeper at the root causes of these problems&mdash;economic mis-management by governments, war, corruption, the absence of a stable rule of law and political maladministration. Nor should we overlook the simple reality of greed and man's inhumanity to man. It is easier for governments, in particular, to blame their populations than to admit their failures, just as it easier for Australian governments to blame the world economy for our problems instead of looking to what they can and should be doing. But we should not be sidetracked by excuses. The present economic position of the Philippines owes more to the late President Marcos' administration than to its people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poet Milton saw reality more clearly when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">do thou but thine, and be not diffident</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dismiss not her, when thou most needest her nigh"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it comes, for example, to environmental degradation, rather than treating human beings as some sort of vermin not fit to roam the earth, we should look at the reasons behind pressure on resources. Often, it will be seen that bad land tenure and land taxation systems are a major cause of problems. When peasants from North East Brazil are driven off the large estates and denied land to live on, of course they will head towards the Amazon rain forest or into the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, with poor housing it will often be found that high land prices caused by tax-induced speculative pressures have meant people do not have enough to spend on the structures they wish to live in. In other cases, there is simply no security of tenure at all and people have no legal right to build anything.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not space here to examine all the causes of every social or economic problem, but any careful observer, before blaming population growth as the cause of any problem, will undertake a real examination of more proximate and immediate causes of the particular problem being investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another new propaganda line says that there is an "unmet demand for contraception"; that access to these "modern" methods is a basic right; and that governments should contribute substantially to population control programs to meet this unmet demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developing world women have a lot of other unmet needs but these have fallen by the wayside because of the overemphasis on contraception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a more cynical line is starting to emerge to justify population control programs. Perhaps the review team will also cite alleged "self interest" as a reason for funding population control. The U.S., which recently increased population control spending, admitted this as a reason for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">J. Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development, said population is directly linked to political stability. "There's a very serious problem that is on the horizon here with respect to food security. We are now seeing the levelling of food production in the world as the population increases. This is contributing to instability."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review team has a serious task before it. I hope that my concerns will be allayed and its publication will examine the relative costs and benefits of population programs in achieving improvements in development indicators vis a vis alternative policies.</PARA>

Austria has compulsory voting for its president in three of the states. In France the Senate has compulsory voting, as do some cantons of Switzerland. But they are the only countries in the world that have any interest in compulsory voting. Yet it is dredged up here in Australia as being some article of faith as part of democracy, when surely democracy and, in turn, liberty, should be extended to the freedom not to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be in the Labor Party some peculiar view that research has shown that it favours the non-socialist parties. Interestingly, analysis shows that it really does not matter much whether there is compulsory voting or non-compulsory voting. Purely on the aspect of freedom of choice, surely there is an argument to have the right not to vote. I welcome a debate on this, but neither time nor place is convenient at the moment. I look forward to such a development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Minchin and Senator Herron are totally wrong. There is nothing in the Commonwealth Electoral Act that refers to compulsory voting. What it refers to is compulsory attendance at the polling booth. Neither they nor I will know whether anyone voted in an election, nor should we ever know. That choice is up to the elector. The elector may make the choice in the privacy of the polling booth whether to fill out the ballot paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no law in this land that can compel anyone to vote. Those opposite are wrong. The matter was considered in discussions of the electoral committee when I was on it in the early days in 1983-84 when we considered a whole raft of electoral reforms. Let me note for the record that some interest by the coalition parties has been shown in electoral reform, because from 1949 to 1983 they did nothing in the electoral area other than to malapportion electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when this was cleaned up in 1974-75, the National Party blackmailed the Liberal Party because that party did not agree to introduce the 5,000 square kilometre provision into the Electoral Act. Those opposite did nothing about closing hours or reforming postal votes. They did nothing about electoral funding or proper redistributions. They atrophied and did nothing about electoral reform for about 40 years. Now there is a sudden interest in this. I do not know whether it is in their self-interest or whether compulsory attendance at booths rather than compulsory voting should be done away with. But this great libertine thing they are pressing always has a great element of hypocrisy because their party would not extend the same right to electors, the right not to have a compulsion on them to extend their preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition says it should not be compulsory to vote&mdash;there is a more technical way to put it&mdash;but if it is, it should be compulsory for preferences to be extended. The coalition has always opposed an optional preferential system. It will not give the voter the choice there. So the coalition wants to give the voters the choice as to whether they go to the polling booth, but once they are there the coalition wants to compel them. If it is so into freedom and so on, it should give voters the choice. If voters want to extend their preference right out through the candidates, the coalition should allow them to do so; but it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a relatively fair system of electoral laws in this country, but self-interest has always intervened on the way through. One of the classic cases is that of changing governments in New South Wales. Every time there was a Labor government we got rid of postal votes&mdash;because they did not help us. Every time the coalition won, that was the end of absentee voting; and so on. But we do have a relatively fair electoral system in this country, standing up and measured against any other electoral system in the world. It is all a matter of checks and balances, and some compromises. So there will never be the perfect system; there is no perfect system for any country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When coalition senators say they oppose compulsory voting, they are really saying they oppose compulsory attendance at a polling booth. We will never know whether a person voted, nor should we. I hope that if they are going to pursue this as an issue, intellectually they will try to grasp whether they should continue to advocate compulsion of extension of preferences, or whether they should extend that freedom as well. </PARA>

The importance of old-growth forest to the protection of many species of fauna is well understood.</PARA>
