<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the growing calls from within the government and the parliamentary Labor Party for new and increased taxes, including calls for a new wealth tax by the Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr; a new death tax&mdash;the return of death duties&mdash;by the honourable member for Fraser, Mr John Langmore; and increased taxes by Victorian Senator Kim Carr and senior New South Wales Senator Bruce Childs, as an alternative to further privatisation. Given the government's promises before the last election that there would be no new taxes, does the government categorically rule out the introduction of new tax measures? What action has been taken by the Prime Minister to discipline Minister Kerr for his contribution to the increasingly confused message being given to the business community on the government's taxation policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has no intention whatsoever of diverting from the fiscal path that we have mapped out and identified in the course of recent budgets, which will, in fact, enable us to meet the basic fiscal objective that we have: to reduce the deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We believe we are perfectly able to meet that target within the framework of existing fiscal mechanisms without any need to supplement or vary them in any way. Moreover, given the expected growth of the economy and the fact that all the risks at the moment seem to be on the upside rather than the downside so far as that growth figure is concerned, there may well be a great deal of further flexibility in terms of being able to meet that target with even more comfort than we believe so at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whatever the outcome of the democratic processes that are at work within the Labor Party, for which we make no apology&mdash;we are that kind of party, we always have been and we have been very effective in government over a very long period as a result of the lively policy debate that has always occurred within our ranks&mdash;we believe there is no reason at this stage to make any assumption at all that the outcome on the various areas where the government has committed itself to privatisation will be changed in any way. But, even in the event that there were to be some modifications of that particular program as a result of party democratic processes, which I for one certainly would not concede at this stage, nonetheless, it is still perfectly possible for us to reach those fiscal targets without going down any of the taxation increases paths that have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. I asked the minister whether he was prepared to categorically rule out any new tax measures. I would hardly think that that was an answer that did so, so I will give him a further opportunity to do so. In view of the government's record of misleading the Australian people before on taxes, I particularly ask: does the minister not recognise that the government is giving a confusing message to the business community when, on the one hand, Minister Kerr&mdash;a minister in his government&mdash;is coming out and calling publicly for the introduction of a new wealth tax and, on the other hand, the minister is coming into this place saying that it is hardly necessary? Will the minister clarify, for the purpose of the Australian business community, exactly what are the government's intentions in relation to increased taxation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the government have any plans to use the tax system to support private health insurance funds, and what would be the implications of such a policy for the deficit reduction strategy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked whether the government has any plans to use the tax system to prop up private health insurance funds. The answer to that question is N-O! The answer to that question is no, we do not. At the last election, it is probably worth noting, the opposition had a plan for the misdirection of $1 1/2 billion to provide rebates for private health insurance in Australia. That would have been $1 1/2 billion that could have been spent on the public health system which the opposition would have put in the private sector. We know as well that Mr Downer has said he will continue to support a policy like this, although, as evasive and slippery as ever, he will not say just how much money he will put into this policy. So I reiterate: we do not have a policy to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;George Gear does.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not have a policy, irrespective of what Senator Campbell might care to interject, and there are a number of reasons why we do not. We firstly think that in itself it is not a necessary or viable option. We secondly think that the private health funds are certainly not in crisis and that, while there is a reduction in membership, there are better ways of addressing that reduction in membership than by just simply throwing millions of dollars of taxpayers' money at it. We do not think that is a viable way of dealing with it. It would misdirect money that could be spent on public health, which goes to everyone, to the private health system and through expensive middlemen. Health economists have looked at this issue and have concluded that if we were to go down that route we would have to provide rebates which would have to be huge and which would have to be extensive. Obviously that does have implications for any budgetary strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not prepared to come forward and deal with the implications of yet another promise that it so glibly and superficially makes. Nonetheless, such a policy would have implications for the government's deficit reduction program&mdash;that is another reason why we would not do it&mdash;or it would require a government to find savings on the expenditure side of the budget. Where would we find them? We have not heard from the opposition, nor will Mr Downer tell us, the implications for bulk-billing. Will it stay? What does he say about the Medicare levy? Will it rise? Where will he find the spending cuts for at least $1.5 billion, and that is on top of the cuts of $5 billion he has already threatened? Which services will he cut? How many public servants will be dismissed, and where? How many health programs will be cut? None of these questions has been answered; nor has the question that stands before Mr Downer: will there be an income tax rise as well? `Has the GST really gone away?', in other words, is the fundamental punch line of the Downer slippery promise on tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let me conclude by saying that no, the government does not have any intention to do this, but we note that the opposition does and that it leaves a great crater of unanswered questions for the opposition on other implications for economic management of its trying to deliver on this promise. It is about time it came forward and started filling in some of those craters with some information.</PARA>

<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="1692" SPEAKER="Gibson Sen B.F." NAMEID="BX5" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BX5">Senator GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Long-term bond rates have risen by over 33 per cent since the beginning of this year, going through the nine per cent barrier last week and increasing by 38 points this morning to 9.6 per cent. Economists are now predicting that housing rates will hit 13 per cent in 1996; in other words, a re-run of what we experienced before under Labor. In the light of the market movements demonstrating that the budget strategy is clearly failing, what advice is the government now giving small business and home buyers? Is the government still advising them that they will not face significant interest rate increases under its policies?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1692" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is that Australian government monetary policy will continue to focus on ensuring that low inflation is maintained. We have every expectation that that result will be achieved. As the Treasurer has said on a number of occasions, official interest rates could not be expected to remain unchanged over the business cycle as growth and activity continue to strengthen. But the continuing very good inflation outlook for Australia does mean that there is no need for monetary policy to be adjusted for some time yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increases in US short-term interest rates and world bond yields&mdash;including, of course, those in recent days&mdash;reflect trends in the United States and world economies, rather than anything that is happening in Australia. Any implications of those movements in bond rates for Australian monetary policy need to be assessed, and always have needed to be assessed, against Australia's own inflation outlook. It is, of course, the case that the US economy is operating at closer to full capacity than Australia is, and short-term interest rates were low and accommodative for their stage of the economic cycle. Potential inflationary pressures are, therefore, of much more concern in the US. By contrast, I repeat that the inflation outlook in Australia&mdash;as honourable senators should all know by now&mdash;remains very positive indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Short-term interest rates in other countries have been falling. Recent reductions in German interest rates were followed by reductions in interest rates in a number of European countries. The rise in bond yields which we are looking at at the moment appears to be perhaps more than anything else&mdash;and certainly at least partly&mdash;due to expectations of stronger world growth against the background that I have just described. In recent days, as we all know, a further factor has, of course, been concern about the possibility of higher inflation in the US arising from a number of factors, including a weaker US dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall picture is one where monetary policy in Australia has been able to be eased substantially since January 1990. Official cash rates have been reduced by 13 1/4 percentage points, from a peak of around 18 per cent, to be currently 4.75 per cent, which is their lowest sustained level since the early 1970s. Lending rates are now at their lowest level for at least a decade, although the rate that faces individual borrowers will always depend, as it does now, on one's credit standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart and soul of the story are the situation in relation to inflation and inflation expectations. The decline in interest rates that we have seen in Australia has been made possible by that decline in inflation and inflationary expectations. The sustained shift to a low inflation environment&mdash;which we will lock in, of course, through the fiscal deficit reduction strategy that I made the subject of the first answer&mdash;will provide a solid foundation for growth in productive investment throughout the rest of the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in interest rates that we have seen has been very positive for business and household cash flows. It has been very positive for the process of business balance sheet repair. It has been positive for business and consumer sentiment, and it is proving that it will be ever more positive for the investment climate. The economic recovery is strengthening. There is a mass of statistics which confirm that. In that environment, the inflation outlook continues to be very good indeed, with the result that the monetary policy and interest rate outlook also look good just for that reason.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. If, as the minister says, the government is concentrating on keeping inflation low, are short-term interest rates being deliberately held down by the Reserve Bank as a result of pressure from the Prime Minister, who has often claimed that the central bank is `in his pocket'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no substance whatsoever to that question. The reason why interest rates are being maintained at the low levels that I have described is simply because the economic fundamentals in this case are so sound and the inflationary expectations in this economy are so fundamentally sound. That is the dynamic that is holding the situation together; it is not jawboning or anything else from the Prime Minister or anybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. What was the outcome of the second Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Women and Development held in Jakarta last week?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1694" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to report to the Senate on the conference that was held in Jakarta last week, representing as it did the second meeting of the Asia-Pacific countries in preparation for the conference of women to be held in Beijing in 1995. The countries represented in the Asia-Pacific region include all the Pacific island countries and Asian countries as far west as Iran. So there is considerable diversity amongst those countries and it is therefore to be appreciated that an agreed position, called the Jakarta declaration, emerged from that conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some distinguishing features of this conference and the declaration which I think are well worth reporting to the Senate. First of all, instead of settling for an agreed set of words, the conference preferred to come up with an agreed set of priorities which touch on issues such as education, poverty, women's health and human rights, including those relating to violence against women. It challenges each country to set its own list of priorities and to come up with ways in which it intends to meet the goals that it sets for itself. So there is a change from having just a talkfest to setting up a program of clearly measurable changes for each country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point to note about this conference is that it is the first of a number of preparatory conferences before the Beijing conference is held. Others will occur in Africa, America and Europe. They will take considerable note of the outcome of this conference. So I think it is very heartening that we had such a successful and unanimous outcome with the Jakarta declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to note the appreciation of many of those countries of Australia's contribution. First of all, they were appreciative of the dollar support to assist countries, particularly the Pacific island countries, to attend this conference. They were also appreciative of our preparedness to contribute to the production of the draft declaration. I am certainly delighted to be part of an Australian team that made such a contribution. I am also pleased that I attended a conference that had such a good outcome. I particularly want to acknowledge the contribution of the Pacific island countries, which caucused before this conference and made a contribution that was completely different from that made a mere 10 years ago at the conference in Nairobi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the contributions of the United Nations and the world through these conferences do make a lot of difference to the status of women. That was certainly measurable from any of the number of statistics that were reported by every country contributing. But, interestingly enough, what all those countries acknowledged was the considerable work still ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important issue that was also raised was the importance of recognising that if half the population of a country is poor then the whole country is poor. It is by resolving the problems of poverty, ill-education or lack of literacy in women that we can actually benefit the whole country. The declaration makes it clear that the advancement of the health of women and the benefits for women will benefit both men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to acknowledge the importance of the timing of this conference, as it was on the eve of the Australia Today: Indonesia 94 conference, which was opened by my colleague Senator Gareth Evans a couple of days later. It was very important in cementing relations between Australia and Indonesia that this conference was hosted by Indonesia so well and with such assistance to all of us. I would particularly like to thank the Australian delegation which made my job so much easier.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan just interjected, quite rightly, that with increasing prosperity in the economy incomes for small business are on the increase, which was proven recently. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business survey showed substantial improvements in prospects for income, sales and growth for small business. It is not as though the provisional tax matter is driving small business to the wall.

We welcome the interest that the Democrats are at last showing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent industry statement and after discussions with small business we introduced a number of policies that will help small business. For example, through the pooled development funds we have improved the ability of small businesses and SMEs which want to start off new businesses to get access to capital. We have improved the access of small businesses to the R&amp;D tax concession by reducing the threshold from $50,000 to $20,000. There is a range of measures in that statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not going to tell them that, Senator Hill. It is more positive news. There has been a good deal of press reporting on the state of the rural economy in recent days. Some of it has been accurate and some of it has somewhat overstated the situation in terms of the analysis that has been drawn. Undoubtedly, Australian farmers have faced very tough financial and physical operating conditions in recent years. This has been brought on mostly by drought, some of it unprecedented in this country's history&mdash;the longest period of dry spells ever experienced in a number of locations in Australia. The other problem has been low commodity prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent rains in some regions have been very welcome. They have come at a time when both commodity prices and farm incomes are showing positive signs of recovery. Without overstating the improvements&mdash;and I think some of the reports have overstated the improvements&mdash;for farmers in recent times, it is fair to say that over 1993-94 many of Australia's agricultural and pastoral regions have experienced good to excellent seasonal conditions and steadily improving market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE's latest forecast of commodity prices, which will be released tomorrow, continues the good news. It forecasts that there will be a seven per cent rise in general commodity prices over 1994-95, mainly due to the 12 per cent rise which is expected in rural commodities. Despite the effect of a higher exchange rate, farm export earnings for 1994-95 will also rise strongly by around six per cent. Further evidence of an improved outlook came last week from ABARE's 1993-94 farm survey report, which found that average incomes for broadacre farmers increased by 33 per cent to 37,200&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former President Carter's historic visit to Pyongyang does appear to have resulted, in the first place, in agreement for a summit to take place between the leaders of North Korea and South Korea. That is very welcome news. There has never been a summit meeting between the leaders of those two countries and it could well be a very major step forward in improving relations between the two Koreas and, indeed, regional security generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly applaud the decisions which seem to have been taken in this respect and the political will which seems to be now evident and which should see the summit proceed. I emphasise those qualifications because detailed arrangements are still being worked out and there have been false starts in the past in summit proposals of this kind. The summit would be an important element, obviously, in contributing to the resolution of the whole issue. But it is not the only element. A second consideration to emerge from the Carter visit is that the DPRK has made it clear that, for it, a resumption of high-level bilateral talks with the United States is a major priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the United States administration seeking clarification, as it has said through diplomatic channels, of the outcome of the visit in this respect. Before agreeing to a third round of high-level talks, the US administration is, quite reasonably, seeking clarification of the precise implications of North Korea's statement that it is prepared to freeze all nuclear activities. Such a freeze would no doubt need to include, at the least, a commitment to no future reprocessing and the maintenance of all existing IAEA&mdash;International Atomic Energy Agency&mdash;safeguards. In that respect, it is a very welcome sign that IAEA inspectors do remain on site at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to ensure the integrity of safeguards on the spent fuel which is being unloaded from the nuclear reactor there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our hope that, subject to these details being confirmed, the USA and the DPRK do proceed to a third round of talks. This remains the basis of international efforts to resolve the nuclear issue, along with the implementation of the bilateral denuclearisation declaration between North Korea and South Korea. The most important outcomes from these talks would be securing North Korean full compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and that country accepting a full range of verification activities, including in relation to past activity on its nuclear program. In return, North Korea could reasonably be expected to receive access to a range of political, economic and security benefits and, indeed, to be welcomed back into the mainstream of the international and regional communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of sanctions, despite former President Carter's comments over the weekend, the US administration has made clear that it will continue with its consultations in the Security Council on such further action unless the DPRK takes the steps necessary to allow a third round of high level talks to proceed. The main point in all this, however, is that clearly there is a further opportunity, perhaps a last opportunity, for the North Koreans, the United States and South Korea to negotiate a resolution of this issue. If that happens, that will, quite sensibly, suspend further Security Council action. Australia certainly urges everyone involved to take the steps necessary to ensure that the negotiating process resumes. That does seem to be unquestionably the most satisfactory way forward from the present situation.</PARA>

Of course it is the case equally, as those opposite might even be aware, that however much drafting was done in Australia the constitution as drafted in Australia had to be approved by the British government and had to be passed by the British parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that a number of key features of that constitution were very much in the constitution by virtue of the very clearly stated preferences of the British government at the time.

At the most recent TPAC meeting last Tuesday, members spent a significant amount of their time talking about APEC. It was one of the key items on the agenda. It was agreed that it will become a permanent item on the advisory council agenda.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important initiative because if, in trade terms, APEC is to be successful, it needs to be removing barriers that business sees as interfering with its capacity effectively to maximise trade and export performance. That has led Australia to set priorities, for example, in the area of standards and investment. In the standards area in particular, that issue was included on the APEC agenda because of a survey of business attitudes within the region to assess which non-tariff measures were causing the greatest concern to Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards were identified as a priority, as was the related question of conformity with those standards. Australia's approach to APEC's current work on standards has benefited from a very direct business input through a consultative committee, which includes representatives from a range of industry groups. They have endorsed the approach taken by the government. In fact, they welcome having a government that is actively concerned about participating effectively in international fora, rather than hiding in 19th century rhetoric about what might be the effect on sovereignty if we participate actively in international fora and achieve Australian objectives in a consultative manner. It is very important that Australia be positive about its participation in these international activities.

One only has to look at the composition of our export table. It is but a few years back that we were a major exporter of agricultural and mineral commodities and a virtual non-exporter of manufactured goods and/or services. Looking at that table, one can see now that we have a huge growth and a huge expansion in our export of manufactured goods, so much so that it outranks the value of agricultural goods. Significantly, the manufactured goods part of our export composition is not in low-end manufacture but in what the statistician calls elaborately transformed manufactures; that is to say, the most sophisticated manufactured goods are the ones that are growing most in export. Indeed, we are a massive exporter of services and our services export account is in balance.</PARA></TALK.START>

One pitches those tax issues on the basis of looking at an all-round commitment to the economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the growth of exports, given the absolute growth of manufacturing exports and the increasing competitiveness of the economy, while I note that from time to time we have received complaints along the lines that this question refers to, nonetheless, it is wrong to pretend that Australia is not a competitive economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Yesterday morning on the Channel Nine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program the minister referred to plans for a government campaign to encourage about one million eligible permanent residents of Australia to become Australian citizens. I ask the minister now whether he will give the Senate any further details of that campaign, and perhaps also explain why citizenship is so important in a multicultural society like ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1703" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for this question. The issue of citizenship is one that I am sure he knows is important. It is a key ingredient to any society. It is particularly important to Australia where the concept of citizenship not only has its normal meaning but also acts as a unifier. In Australia citizenship does in fact unite people who have come here from all over the world&mdash;from, according to the last census, some 240 different places of origin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think also we recognise, as does Senator McKiernan in his position of chair of the parliamentary committee, that in Australia, unlike other parts of the world, we have an inclusive approach to citizenship, one which is quite basic in managing a culturally diverse society. In our society citizenship is a right available to anyone after two years permanent residence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of citizenship emanates on two levels. It is important in terms of the rights that one carries when one becomes a citizen&mdash;the right to vote and the right to stand for parliament. It also has symbolic values which are even greater still because, by taking out Australian citizenship, one is declaring a commitment to the country in which one has chosen to live and acknowledging publicly that commitment and that being Australian carries responsibilities as well as rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has looked at ways of ensuring that take-up rates can be improved in this area. For instance, in the 1991 census we were told that communities have extremely high rates of citizenship. For example, in the Greek community the take-up rate is 95 per cent; 98 per cent of those who are Ukraine-born are citizens; 96 per cent of those from the former Baltic States are citizens; 91 per cent from the former Yugoslavia are citizens; and 90 per cent from Laos are citizens. The Vietnamese community has probably the highest take-up rate after a 15-year incoming period with 96 per cent of that community having become citizens, whereas the mean across the board for other communities is only 72 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, the government is concerned that about one million Australian people who are permanent residents have not become Australian citizens. Some have lived here for several decades. In fact, half the number of permanent residents have come from the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and only 53 per cent of the eligible UK-born community has taken out citizenship. I am sure Senator McKiernan would recognise that many others were of Irish origin, although the new pledge of commitment introduced on Australia Day this year has already encouraged hundreds of Irish permanent residents to take out citizenship here. In fact, only this month we saw 99 Irish-Australians, including the editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Irish Echo</EMPHASIS>, become citizens at a special ceremony at the Hyde Park Barracks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to do more. The government committed $3 1/4 million to a campaign this financial year, in the 1994-95 budget. It will be a multimedia campaign, and I look forward to launching that later this year. In addition, $450,000 a year will be allocated for the next three years to follow up with a range of community activities and strategies. The campaign will be targeted specifically at non-citizens, and the specific objective of the campaign will be to get the take-up rate increased.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At question time on 9 June, Senator Harradine asked Senator Robert Ray, in his capacity as Minister representing the Prime Minister&mdash;and, indeed, imminent Acting Prime Minister&mdash;a question without notice seeking details of the government's commitment to consider the introduction of a maternity allowance in next year's budget.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I provide the following answer to Senator Harradine's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing the Prime Minister has said on the Maternity Allowance limits the proposal only to women in the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is introducing this payment to assist families at the time of the birth of a baby, when families need assistance with extra costs. The allowance will be payable whether the mother was at home or in the paid workforce prior to maternity leave. It is proposed that the allowance will be paid through the Social Security system so that mothers can receive the payment directly into their bank accounts, as is the case with other family payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to family payments or tax relief for families after 12 weeks of maternity leave, the Government has an extensive package of payments aimed at ensuring adequate support for families with children, and it is important to see the Maternity Allowance in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family Payments assist almost 85% of families with the costs of raising children and are paid on a per child basis, with a higher rate for low income families (Additional Family Payment). The new Parenting Allowance and the Home Child Care Allowance will be payments for a partner who is caring for children. With the commencement of the Parenting Allowance in July 1995, these two payments will be combined into a single payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important shift in the Government's approach to family-related assistance has been the move to payments made directly to the primary carer, usually the mother, and away from payments through the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's record of assistance to families is a record we can be proud of. We are building on this record with the next historic step of a Maternity Allowance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why are the capital gains tax provisions necessary when there is already, within our complex tax system, extensive anti-avoidance measures?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general anti-avoidance provisions in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act are not the appropriate mechanism for dealing with undue tax advantages arising from the types of transactions addressed by the amendments (for example, value shifting and payment of rebatable dividends transactions). This is because Part IVA needs to be applied on a case-by-case basis. The capital gains tax provisions should automatically apply to the transactions addressed by the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a self assessment environment it is important to provide certainty in the law.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share value shifting provisions will make the raising of new capital by private companies extraordinarily timorous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share value shifting provisions will not apply to the raising of capital by companies where the capital is raised by the issue of new shares at or above market value. If the new shares are issued at less than market value to associates of the original shareholders such that the market value of those original shares decrease, the value shifting provisions will potentially apply to prevent any undue tax advantages arising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment (page 1522 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also have concerns about the cost of monitoring and complying with the share value shifting provisions on the corporate community. They will far outweigh the tax lost to those who innocently run into a shift of share values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of monitoring and complying with the share value shifting provisions will not outweigh the revenue protected by the provisions. Share value shifting transactions have the potential to significantly erode the capital gains tax base. For instance, in one case of which the ATO is aware a value shifting transaction had the potential to generate an artificial capital loss of over $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give an undertaking to examine this issue [the potential application of the value shifting provisions to public floats and employee share schemes] closely with a view to excluding such transactions and employee share plans from the operation of Division l9B?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of Division l9B is twofold. First it is designed to address situations where value shifting creates the effect of a disposal of a share without an actual disposal for capital gains tax purposes. Secondly it ensures that value shifting cannot be used to gain an undue tax advantage by either creating a capital loss or reducing a capital gain that would otherwise accrue on the disposal of shares. It does not matter by what means these undue tax advantages would be gained (for example, by a scheme entered into solely to shift value out of shares into other shares, or by the public float of a company or an employee share acquisition scheme).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share value shifting provisions do not contain specific exemptions. However, because the provisions only apply to the extent that a value shift results in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">material</EMPHASIS> reduction in value of shares, and because the value shift must be from shares held by the controller of a company or an associate to other shares held by that person or an associate, most genuine employee share acquisition schemes and public floats will not fall within Division l9B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government advise as to the policy behind excluding the operation of 160M(7) but not Part IVA? Will the Government advise why this is in the Explanatory Memorandum and not in the Bill itself?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 160M(7) is a residual provision which only operates where other provisions of Part IIIA do not. Therefore, the subsection will not operate where Division l9B would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part IVA of the Act applies to eliminate tax benefits obtained through the undertaking of a tax avoidance scheme. If, notwithstanding Division l9B, such benefits were obtained through a tax avoidance scheme involving share value shifting, it would be appropriate to apply Part IVA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above results arise as a matter of statutory interpretation. Subsection 160M(7) is stated to be `subject to the other provisions of this Part' (which would include Division l9B). Part IVA would continue to be applicable because it is not specifically or implicitly excluded by Division l9B or any other provision of the Act. The explanatory memorandum simply makes these points clear and does not seek to change the effect of the Bill or the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give a firm assurance that bonus shares will only be dealt with under Part IIIA?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As enacted, the Bill ensures that where the specific provisions of the bonus share provisions of the Act address the value shifting aspect of the issue of bonus shares, those provisions will apply to the exclusion of the general value shifting provisions of Division l9B. This is confirmed by the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division l9B does not offer rollover relief to corporate groups with respect to value shifting arrangements. I call on the Government to give further consideration to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has considered this matter and has decided that it would be inappropriate to allow roll-over relief for value shifts for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, to prevent abuse of the roll-over relief granted for transfers of assets within a company group, the capital gains tax provisions provide for a deemed disposal of an asset which has been rolled-over if the company holding the asset leaves the company group. If roll-over relief was extended to share value shifting transactions, a similar recapture provision would be required. This would make it necessary to keep track of all the shares involved in the value shift until they, or one of the companies involved in the shift, are disposed of outside the company group. This might be a long period of time. Thus compliance costs and record keeping requirements would be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the current rules governing transfers of assets within a corporate group where roll-over relief is claimed require the tracing of the value shifting effect of the transfer through chains of related entities. It would not be desirable to add further complexity to these rules by including roll-over relief for share value shifting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, there is no compelling reason why share value shifting, which is within the taxpayer's control, should occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the value shifting provisions be used to avoid tax in the situation where a non-resident shareholder shifts value into shares held by Australians to increase their cost base? How can a capital gains tax liability be enforced against such a non-resident shareholder if it is a resident of certain treaty partners, where the treaty limits Australia's taxing rights as to capital gains? How can any capital gains tax liability be enforced against such a non-resident shareholder in any case, if it has no assets in Australia and the shares from which value has been shifted are subsequently worthless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answers to these questions have been incorporated in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 8 June 1994 on page 1531 in a response to Senator Harradine's question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment (page 1523 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The materiality test only requires a shift in market value of more than the lesser of 5% in value or $100,000 which is not a very material for a large corporation. I urge the Government to give very serious consideration to revising the test to 10 or 15% or $0.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In principle, Division l9B should apply to all value shifting transactions. The test for what is a material shift in value (i.e. the lesser of 5% of the value of the shares and $100,000) has been determined having regard to potential compliance costs and the need to protect the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A shift in value may generate a capital loss of the amount of the shift (or reduce a capital gain by that amount). If the threshold were increased to, for instance, $500,000, this would enable shareholders with large shareholdings to generate considerable tax savings by entering into value shifting schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There does not appear to be any policy reason or logic for denying the beneficial effect of the proposed amendments to  reorganisations where a less than 100% interest in the sub-group is disposed of to an unrelated party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to section 160ZZOA provides an exemption from the section 160ZZOA deemed disposal and re-acquisition rule in relation to assets held within a subgroup. A pre-requisite for the exemption to apply is that all the shares held by a parent company group in the subgroup must be disposed of. It is necessary for the amendment to be restricted to situations where all the shares in the subgroup are disposed of since the full value of the asset which has been transferred within the subgroup will only be realised if all the shares are sold. If only some of the shares are sold the deemed disposal and re-acquisition rule currently provided by section 160ZZOA needs to apply to ensure any capital gain accrued on the asset cannot be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, if the amendment allowed the exemption to apply where only some of the shares in the subgroup were sold, this would represent a departure from the general principle in section 160ZZOA that the disposal of just one share is sufficient to trigger the deemed disposal and re-acquisition rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government will give further consideration to the implications of departing from the general principle referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 52 attempts to remedy this [certain problems with the existing provisions concerning the Commissioner's powers to issue an amended assessment in relation to capital gains] by removing all time limits on the Commissioner's powers to issue assessments where an asset has been disposed under a contract or as a result of compulsory acquisition. But in the process seems to give the Commissioner unrestricted time limits for issuing amended assessments in all cases. Did the Government intend to create this situation or does it concede that the result referred to is the result of poor drafting?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This question refers to clause 52 of the Bill. The clause to which the question relates is in fact clause 51.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 51 does not give the Commissioner unrestricted time limits for issuing amended assessments in respect of capital gains even where there has been no delay between the contract date and the disposal date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision proposes to insert new subsection 160U(10) in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS>. The scope of the new subsection is limited by the important words `to give effect to'. This means that the Commissioner may only amend an assessment for the purpose of making subsections 160U (3) and (8) effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This view is reinforced by the commentary in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments [to the transfer of group company loss provisions] create the result that the provisions are becoming incredibly complicated and corporate clients are not prepared to pay the record keeping expenses to their accountants to meet the requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which are concessional to taxpayers, are not particularly complicated. Moreover, they were sought by the taxation profession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has the Government taken into consideration that it would be unusual for companies paying dividends to turn their minds to whether or not they were paid out of pre-acquisition profits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of whether or not dividends have been paid out of pre-acquisition profits only arises if the disposal of shares results in a capital loss. Moreover, the amendment only affects corporate shareholders who control the company and their associates. The Government considers that such shareholders would clearly be in a position to determine whether dividends could be taken to be reasonably attributable to pre-acquisition profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Government advise why there is a different treatment of dividends paid out of asset revaluation reserves which are connected with a reduction in capital and those which are not connected with a reduction in capital?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dividends which represent a reduction in capital of a company effectively represent the return to the shareholder of the capital costs of the shares. Therefore, when those dividends are effectively untaxed under other provisions of the Act (because, for instance, they are rebatable and paid from a revaluation reserve), it is appropriate to reduce the cost base of the shares by that amount. This ensures that the cost of the shares which has been returned to the shareholder cannot be used to reduce a capital gain or create a capital loss on a subsequent disposal of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question (page 1524 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government undertake to make a clear statement confirming that a loss company which receives a distribution will not obtain a dividend rebate and will consequently not be subject to dividend rebate adjustments?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A loss company would not pay income tax. Therefore there would be no rebate of tax in respect of a dividend paid during the loss year. Therefore the Government confirms that a loss company which receives a distribution will not be subject to dividend rebate adjustments.</PARA>

<PARA>It gave me no pleasure to raise the matter of Singleton Air Services, trading as Yanda Airlines, under parliamentary privilege because of the potential adverse commercial impact that this matter might have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will know that last week the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called yet another talkfest to speak with industry and conservation groups on the matter of greenhouse gas emissions. This was despite the fact that several years ago the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology reported on the question of greenhouse gas emissions and included in its report a number of very specific suggestions which could be carried out at little cost to either government or society and which would provide many benefits. This was also despite the fact that the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, set up a series of ecologically sustainable development working groups, which also came forward several years ago with a number of suggestions which would allow this government to address the question of greenhouse with little or no cost to either government or society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute of Engineers put out a press release dated 1 June, which I have in front of me, noting that it has called on the federal government to prove that it is serious about its undertaking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. It warned that the government will be struggling to even stabilise emissions at their present level if poor leadership and apathy continue. The press release goes on to quote one of the engineering profession's foremost experts on greenhouse emissions, who claims that Australia's record of energy wastage&mdash;not usage&mdash;is so poor that the country need adopt only the most basic measures to achieve a dramatic cut in emissions. There are many ways in which this government can reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions which would not only not cost anything but also save money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that has been staring this government in the face for a long time is that of water heating. We have an industry which is very efficient in the method of manufacturing our solar water heaters. In South Australia we have a penetration of one per cent of solar water heaters in houses; in Western Australia we have about 25 per cent. By simply shifting the tariff structure in a very minor way, we can achieve an enormous improvement in the use of solar energy for water heating and space heating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of transport, in a revenue neutral way, as the Australian Democrats have suggested for a long time, we could shift the fixed costs of car ownership onto the running costs of car ownership. We could shift the costs of registration and third party insurance onto a fuel cost. So people would pay exactly the same on average, but it would be on car usage and not on car ownership. These sorts of measures would make a very substantial difference to the emission of greenhouse gases in the transport area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Panizza is looking at me. I point out very quickly, by way of qualification, that clearly we would also need to consider the fact that country people travel greater distances and would therefore require some support if such a measure were implemented. Recommendations have been repeatedly given to this government by a number of bodies, such as the Institute of Engineers and the ESD working groups, which have had represented on them members of both industry and conservation bodies. The government has also received recommendations from the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. If these recommendations were adopted, it would not only allow us to meet the stabilisation and then the 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005, but, as the Institute of Engineers points out, also result in a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. For the government to attempt to argue that it is somehow protecting the Australian industry by avoiding going down this road is ridiculous. If we do not go down this road, we will not have in place the industries which we will need in the 21st century. We will be a backward country. Instead of developing industries which we could then export to other countries, we will be left with a whole raft of industries which will fit in more with the 19th century, and not even with the 20th century. </PARA>

One thing that needs to be understood by the Senate and Senator Coulter&mdash;he might want to review his policy in the light of what I am about to say, although what I am about to explain may not bother him&mdash;is that one of the great problems Australia has in becoming an economically efficient nation is the massive inequities in the federal-state financial relationship. We have witnessed a massive centralisation of taxing powers in the hands of the Commonwealth. The greatest centralisation of power has taken place in the last 11 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot run an economically efficient nation unless we have sensible federal-state financial relations. One of the greatest backwards steps in federal-state financial relations was when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, tried to stab the then Prime Minister in the back. He got up at the National Press Club and basically derailed what was the best hope of any reform of federal-state financial relations. One of the best contributions to Australian national affairs was the federal-state financial reforms proposed by Mr Hawke and Mr Greiner in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter is saying that he would ensure that the states lost access to another source of revenue, state registration fees, by handing them over as another federal tax. We already have the worst vertical fiscal imbalance in the free world. There are only a few federations in the world that are worth talking about and they are the United States, Germany, Australia and Canada. Of those four federations, we have by far the worst vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the prerequisites for having a good environment&mdash;I agree with Senator Coulter on this principle&mdash;and an efficient economy is to ensure that the environmental costs are obvious and are paid by the people who impose the costs. I do not think the way Senator Coulter proposes to impose these taxes is particularly fair. This system has massive inequities for people who live in remote areas and have to travel long distances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to ask Senator Coulter, when he is looking at solutions to environmental problems, to consider some of the other problems that would be raised. The issue of vertical fiscal imbalance is crucial. I put it to Senator Coulter and the Senate that, unless we have a sensible balance of taxing and spending powers within the Australian federation, we will have an inefficient economy like we have at the moment. If we have an inefficient economy, we will not have efficient solutions to environmental problems which are crucial to future generations of Australians. </PARA>

They are very big on green issues in this term of parliament. In the last parliament they were making a huge push for the bush.

<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware that one of the issues in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 concerned the bringing forward of the collections of certain HECS fees. However, senators were also aware that, despite reservations on our side about certain critical matters in the legislation, the Liberal Party listened to the request from the three tiers of the higher education constituency, that is, the students, the tertiary education groups and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, for us to support the legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Watson,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We write regarding our concern which was raised by Senator Watson in the Senate on Wednesday 8 June. It relates primarily to the proposed introduction of a pro rata calculation for the repayment of the HECS debt, and was raised in discussions regarding the PAYE legislation, to which it is closely linked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposed legislation goes ahead unchecked, students whose weekly or fortnightly pay during the holiday period (or during semester, for that matter) is the equivalent of a yearly income of $26,852 will be forced to pay back an extra 3% of their pay packet (4% or 5% if they reach the subsequent threshold levels) which previously would have been paid back only once they had graduated and found full-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not only inequitable, but totally out of touch with the lifestyles of students forced to support themselves through tertiary study. Many students work furiously during holiday periods to save enough money to live on through the semester, and for this reason they will often earn high weekly wages which result in low yearly incomes. It is unfair that these students should be slugged with an added tax which will make it even more difficult to survive through the year&mdash;on the other hand, students whose income is consistent, but lower on a weekly basis, will not suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this legislation was announced we were assured that it would not affect holiday work, or part-time or casual work done during the course of study, but would apply only to those leaving full time study: it is now apparent that this assurance is worthless. The Government does not appear to be honouring this promise to exempt those still studying from repaying their HECS debt provisionally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that this is simply not good enough. Students are being attacked from all sides, and mere subsistence is becoming more difficult with every added piece of legislation. Once this legislation comes into effect, students could conceivably be repaying HECS from `day one' of their degree, and this is only one step away from upfront fees. Isn't the Labor Party opposed to such regressive and inequitable measures?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly urge you to stand up for the livelihood of students when the Senate discusses this legislation, to ensure that students are exempted from compulsorily repaying their HECS debt until the completion of their degree.</PARA>

<PARA>It may not be apparent to those on the Labor side, because they did not have the opportunity of seeing Senator Gareth Evans's face, but when he described Mr Keating as a `constitutional expert' the grin went from ear to ear. It was one of the funniest things I have heard on this side of the chamber for a long time. I do not propose to admonish Senator Evans for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his remarks, Senator Evans raised the very provocative issue of appeals to the Privy Council. Australia abolished appeals to the Privy Council in 1986. The abolition of those appeals was supported on both sides of the chamber. What concerns me is the provocative way this was raised. Senator Evans knows as well as I do that in 1990-91 the Hawke Government decided to open up appeals to UN committees to allow the UN Human Rights Committee to become involved in Australian domestic disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that action by the government overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act. I point out to Senator Evans that every time those on the government side talk about this Privy Council I will be getting up in this chamber and reminding the chamber and the public that it was this government that overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act and agreed to involve UN committees in Australian domestic activities. I think that was an appalling action, particularly as it was done without any reference to this parliament and despite the opposition of some of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess Australians want to know who is on these committees&mdash;it is a question which I have posed from time to time to Senator Evans&mdash;and the names of the people who will be making rulings on Australian domestic disputes. There are now three committees involved. There is the UN Human Rights Committee, which the Hawke government decided in September 1981 that Australians could take complaints to. Then the great republican Paul Keating decided just before the 1993 election that one UN committee was not sufficient, and that we had to have two more so that there may be another range of appeals by Australians that could be taken to the UN in Geneva. These were the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN Committee Against Torture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that many on these committees are the nominees of governments that do not themselves practise human rights and democracy as we know it in Australia. I have raised in this chamber the astonishing aspect that on one of the committees that Mr Keating decided should make rulings on Australian disputes there happens to be a nominee of Fidel Castro: Carlos Hevia. I raised this issue with Senator Evans before and Senator Evans was unable to tell me what particular expertise Castro's nominee can bring to human rights disputes in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only was Senator Kemp's contribution utterly irrelevant to the matter at issue in question time, but he was, as usual, talking absolutely through his hat on this particular subject for two reasons. In the first place, there is a huge difference between a court making an appellate decision binding every court in Australia, which was of course the case with the Privy Council appeals, and a body making a purely advisory or declaratory decision which does not amount to anything of binding force on anybody in this country. It is not a matter of the committee in question ruling over anybody in the sense of applying a rule to which others are subject. That difference needs to be stated every time Senator Kemp goes down this particular track.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very interesting to hear Senator Gareth Evans confirm to the Senate and the Australian people that the decision of the United Nations is only advisory. Why does he not tell that to the Tasmanian government and then butt out, instead of seeking to override the right of the Tasmanian parliament to legislate for and on behalf of the people of Tasmania as it deems appropriate and for which it will be responsible to the people of Tasmania at the next state election? Of course, Senator Evans wants to assert that the decision is a lot more than advisory, because when this matter undoubtedly goes before the High Court he will be seeking to assert that his government has some sort of international obligation to insist on this legislation being passed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very good constitutional structure. The Labor Party has been setting out to destroy that constitutional structure by its republican push. The wheels clearly are falling off the republican bandwagon. As a result, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in a desperate attempt to get the wagon back on the road, made the outrageous comments that my colleague and friend Senator Ferguson referred to, when he said that learning about the constitution apprises people of the fact that we have a constitution which was designed by the British Foreign Office. The British Foreign Office had no input whatsoever. The Colonial Office may have had a degree of input, but the British Foreign Office had no role whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a clear case of the Prime Minister seeking to rewrite history and the heritage of this great country and to belittle the efforts of our founding fathers who wrote the Australian constitution. It is a document of which we as Australians ought to be very proud. It has withstood the test of time, having now been in existence for well over 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the Prime Minister's recent comments to the French president&mdash;the president of the fifth republic of France. France has had five goes and has failed four times. We will wait and see when the fifth one collapses. Australia has had one constitutional monarchy&mdash;one constitution which has served us very well. The Australian Labor Party is seeking to destroy that by its move for a republic. It knows that the people of Australia do not want a republic, so Mr Keating now has to gild the lily and distort history to try to come up with some rationale as to why Australians should not feel proud of their constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what greater input there could have been than that made by the four important individuals who drafted, or assisted in drafting, the constitution. One came to Australia when he was aged nine and the other three were Australian born. Does Paul Keating think he is somehow more Australian than the three who were born in Australia some 100 or so years before we were born? Are they somehow less Australian or is he saying to the people of Australia, `If you happen to be an immigrant and came out here as a child at the age of nine, you should not be considered as an Australian?' Let him come clean on what he is actually saying about the founders of our constitution. All four&mdash;Samuel Griffith, Kingston, Clark and Edmund Barton&mdash;were great Australians of whom we as Australians ought to feel very proud. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A bill for an Act to amend the Flags Act 1953 to ensure that the Australian National Flag is not altered except with the approval of the Australian people voting in a referendum, that the Australian National Flag is not supplanted by the use of the powers under the Act, and that the appointment of other flags and ensigns is subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that this bill will pass the Senate once again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This time the Government must respond and ensure that the bill is debated and passed through the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no argument with the principle that the national symbols such as the flag belong to the people. The flag should not be changed without the approval of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, Mr Keating himself has conceded as much when he said that the flag cannot be changed without a very clear consensus in favour of change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A referendum is the fairest way to determine the attitudes of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed polls have shown that 80 per cent of Australians think there should be a national referendum before any change is made to the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is well known that the Labor Government is attempting in a number of areas to rewrite the history of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is no more evident than in the debate over the flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating has consistently attacked the significance of the flag in Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He ignores the fact that in 1901 the Prime Minister, Edmund Barton announced a competition for the design of the flag which attracted some 32,000 entries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the day the winners were announced by Prime Minister Barton, a large flag embodying the ideas of the winning design was flown over the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne. Photographs of the day showing it as having a design quite similar to that officially proclaimed later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1953 Flags Act, as Robert Menzies said in his second reading speech, was</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"very largely a formal measure which puts into legislative form what has become the established practice in Australia."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He reminded the House that at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia the attention of the Australian Government was directed to the necessity to adopt an Australian flag. Following the competition, the current flag (with minor modifications) was officially gazetted in 1903.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian flag can be traced back to an earlier period in Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1849 the Ladies of Launceston embroidered a flag for the Australasian Anti-Transportation League.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag had a blue field, it had a union jack and a southern cross in exactly the same positions as they are today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flag was the forerunner of both the Victorian flag and the eventually the Australian national flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my colleague Senator Newman said in a most interesting speech on June 25, 1992, "the push for independence that this league started in 1849 demonstrated an independence of spirit which has been part of our history since that time".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She continued "[the Australian national flag] is an integral part of our history. It is not something that suddenly became our flag in the national Flags Act in 1953; it has been with us in some form or other since 1849".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to demean its historical significance Mr Keating has claimed that Australians did not fight under the flag in the first world war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does he then say to General Monash's account published in his book "Victories in France, 1918", when he wrote about the historic moment when the Australians broke through German lines on 8 August 1918 and turned the tide of the war, it states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Australian flag hoisted over Harbonnieres at midday today. Should be glad if Chief would cable this to our Governor-General on behalf of Australian corps."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating was recently embarrassed in the House of Representatives when the Leader of the Opposition tabled a card sent from a digger on the Western front in 1916 to a Brisbane lady.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The card showed a digger holding the Australian national flag, it carried the title "Australia For Ever". </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An official publication of the Department of Administrative Services sums up the military history of the flag very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It states that the flag was carried into New Guinea at the outbreak of World War I by the naval and military force which captured the German colonies, by the cruiser Sydney in the first naval battle of the war, by the Anzacs who landed at Gallipoli and by the diggers who spearheaded the victories in France in 1917-18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was seen around the world again in World War II. When Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to fly was an Australian ensign made secretly in a prison camp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Frank Cayley in his book "Flag of Stars" tells the story:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The first allied flag raised in Singapore after the Japanese surrender in 1945 was an Australian ensign that had been  made in secret by Australian prisoners of war.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A small Union Jack, which had escaped discovery during the many searchers made by Japanese guards, was stretched onto the corner of some blue material "borrowed" from Japanese stores; handkerchiefs from Red Cross parcels provided the necessary white for the Commonwealth Star and the stars of the Southern Cross and the flag was in readiness when news was heard by secret radio that Japanese surrender was imminent. When surrender came, the flag was raised over `X3' Working Camp at Bukit Panjang and later over AIF headquarters at Changi."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1908 it has also been raised for medal winners at every Olympic Games. In 1956 it flew with pride of place as the flag of the host nation at Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Mr Keating treats Australian history with contempt he also has little regard for the traditions of his party. Listen to what Dr Evatt said in the debate on the Flags Bill 1953:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The flag that is now Australia's national flag, which is based on the Blue Ensign is a very beautiful flag. It is probably the most beautiful flag in the world."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arthur Calwell joined in the debate and said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is true that a flag is merely a piece of bunting, but it also true that it is something round which the whole nation can be rallied . . . a flag with a blue background was specially chosen by the men who made the famous stand at the Eureka stockade."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) interjected and Mr Calwell retorted.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating is bored with politics and would much rather concentrate on aesthetics. He'd better change his mind.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating should not worry about aesthetics; he should start to concentrate a little bit on getting his facts right on Australian history. As was pointed out in question time today, the disgraceful comment made by Mr Keating that the Australian constitution was written in the British Foreign Office was absolutely and totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that it be admitted that not all those on the other side of the chamber and not all Australian Labor Party people are enthusiastic supporters of Mr Keating's push to tear down the Australian national flag and to overturn the constitution of this country. Not all Australian Labor Party members of parliament and, particularly, not all Labor Party supporters are in favour of that. In fact, the word has come through to Mr Keating and the caucus that they should lay off the flag. After a week of blundering around overseas, as he regularly does, Mr Keating is hoping to take the Australian flag off the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have presented a Flags Amendment Bill to the parliament. That bill will ensure that if our national flag is to be changed it will not be changed by the edict of Mr Keating but will be changed by a vote of the Australian people. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, there is no sign at all amongst the Australian public, nor indeed in Labor Party research&mdash;if Senator Schacht does not believe me, he should believe Labor Party research&mdash;that there is a move to change the Australian flag. Indeed, traditional Labor Party supporters, and I am not speaking of the new lot which has come in in recent years, are as proud of the flag as are we in our party. They will not tolerate a change, and neither will I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating says that he wants to dump the constitution. When we reflect on what his aims are, I think it is important to think about the nature of the task he has ahead of him and of what this constitution means to Australia. If he wants to argue the case for a change in the constitution, I say that he should present his alternatives because the government has had three years to present its alternatives. Then we can weigh up what the Labor Party is proposing compared with the current constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think that Australia's constitution is one of the greatest achievements of Australian history. I sustain that by saying that there are few, if any, countries in the world that can claim a longer, continuous, democratic history than Australia. I say that because it was Australia which, just after the turn of the century, gave women the right to vote and the right to stand for parliament. There was only one other country in the world at that time which was prepared to give equivalent rights, and that was New Zealand. This long period of constitutional stability, this long history of a nation involved in nation building, war, peace and depression, has been one of the pillars which has provided the stability which this nation of ours enjoys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the Prime Minister's comments, I want to point out that this is truly a people's constitution. I sustain that by pointing out that the constitution was drafted in Australia by Australians and for Australians. In order for that drafting process to be carried out, Australians elected their representatives to be involved at the various constitutional conventions to undertake that drafting. When, towards the end of the last century, this great work had been completed, this constitution, drafted by the representatives of the people, was put to the Australian people in all the states in a referendum and, of course, was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect on this people's constitution compared with other great constitutions. The constitution of the United States of America was never put to the people in the US for their approval; neither, and nor could it be, was the largely unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom; nor was the constitution of New Zealand. None of those could be described as people's constitutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has acquired a great love for things French, and as he walked around the silver room where Napoleon resigned he discussed with the French, in one of the most demeaning performances of any political leader, his plans to make Australia a republic. He has not discussed them with us. When Senator Schacht stands up and starts talking about the republic he should tell us about the republic he wants; he should tell us precisely so that we can debate the government's constitution, when those opposite are prepared to put it down on paper. Of the first three French republics, none were put to the people in a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This constitution is truly a people's constitution. It is truly an Australian constitution. It is clearly a constitution which, by all the tests involved, has been a massive achievement for this country. Now Mr Keating wants to have this overturned. The question is why? Was there an upsurge of republican feeling amongst the public? No. The Labor Party at the Hobart conference ran out of puff. As Senator Schacht said, the Labor Party has to attempt to attract new ideas and maybe it should start to promote the republican movement. There was no upsurge of feeling or concern. This is why I say to Senator Schacht that this is a very divisive debate which has been launched by Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was well put by my colleague Senator Abetz, this was the constitution of the Australian people. If Mr Keating wants to change it, those opposite can put their views up but they should not attempt to denigrate or rewrite the history of this country. What is the point of demeaning this historic Australian document, which I believe is one of the great achievements of this nation, and demeaning the work of the founders of this constitution by pretending that it was somehow the draft of the British Foreign Office?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Chamberlain objected to Clause 74 of the proposed Constitution which prevented (except for the Queen's right to grant special leave by Royal prerogative, which in any case the Federal Parliament would be empowered to limit at its legislative discretion) appeals proceeding from the Federal High Court to the British Privy Council on matters involving interpretation of the Constitutions of the Commonwealth and any State, unless those matters involved the public interest of some part of the British Empire other than the Commonwealth or State. Despite its safeguards, this clause was regarded by the Colonial Office as a threat to imperial interests <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">inside</EMPHASIS> the new Commonwealth. To Chamberlain, these interests meant not only matters affecting Britain's foreign relations but also `the private interests of investors . . . a very large class . . . of British subjects interested in Australia.' Their interests might be affected by Constitutional cases, it was felt at Whitehall, and should therefore be protected by leave to appeal.</PARA>
<PARA>Souter goes on for the next couple of pages and explains why we did get the provision for leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and that the Privy Council could choose to hear whether there should be an appeal to itself over a non-constitutional matter. That was what was forced on the drafters of the constitution as an example of the British interest coming through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, one might not have found that objectionable because, at that time in history, we were in the high flux of the British Empire. But Senator Kemp should not go around saying that there were not influences by the British government on quite central issues relating to the drafting of the constitution. The people who were referred to who drafted the constitution&mdash;such as Deakin, Downer and others&mdash;had to concede those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans mentioned earlier today that Australia ended up with sections 58, 59 and 60, for example, in our constitution. Those sections state that if the Governor-General&mdash;who was then an appointed UK official&mdash;decided to reserve a bill for the Queen's pleasure, she had two years to approve it. More incredibly still, the Queen had the power to annul any Australian law within one year of its enactment, even if the Governor-General approved it. That was put in by the British Foreign Office; that was put in by the British Colonial Office.

He said that New Zealand was the only country to provide rights to women equivalent to ours, in 1894&mdash;the right to stand for parliament and to vote. The fact is that although New Zealand allowed women the right to vote in 1893, it would not, until 1919, grant women the right to stand for election. So he got it wrong, but the sky has not fallen in. I am not saying that history is not important; it is. But of all the matters which could constitute a matter of public importance to be discussed here today, when looking at this issue, why not talk about something more meaningful such as the long-term effects of global economies on national economies, the long-term effects of global economies on national borders and national symbols?

We cannot stop change; we cannot ignore it. But national symbols, important as they are, have to be symbols that embrace us all and reflect that change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start my contribution by reminding the Senate of exactly what we are debating today. Until two minutes before Senator Schacht got on his feet, he thought we were debating the flag. For the last eight minutes, Senator Kernot has told us that she thinks we are opposing all change for the sake of it. I wish to read the wording of this matter of public importance so that we can get everyone back on track. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's failure to acknowledge that the Australian Constitution was written in Australia by Australians and for Australians and his continuing distortion of Australian history in an attempt to advance his radical plans to tear up our national symbols and to overturn our constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are debating today. Senator Schacht has said that this is a joke and a political stunt. I could not agree with him more. That is how this Labor Party is treating this whole debate. He said that we were motivated out of hatred for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). All I can say is that at least that gives the whole of Australia something in common with 75 per cent of the Labor Party. The fact of the matter is that they do not trust this man; they will never trust this man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Labor Party member of the House of Representatives has said that the view the Prime Minister has of Australian history is a comic book version of Manning Clark's view. That did not come from us. That came from a Labor Party member of the House of Representatives. I am delighted that they share the same view as we do. It is an absolute and utter joke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that French President Mitterrand said to him, `I've never heard an Australian talk this way before.' I will bet he has not. Never before has an Australian Prime Minister gone offshore and tried to change Australian history while he has been offshore. For that matter, never has an Australian Prime Minister tried to change Australian history while he has been onshore! But the Prime Minister goes off and flaps his gums to President Mitterrand. He then comes back and sings his own praises, saying that the French President has never heard an Australian speak like that before. I wonder whether he also said, `Good day, scumbag.' The French President has probably never heard an Australian Prime Minister speak like that before either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that this Prime Minister is doing this country immense damage by continually wishing to change history. This whole government has continually wanted to change history in the area of multiculturalism. The area of multiculturalism is not some province that is exclusive to the Labor Party. It was the Liberal Party that instituted multiculturalism in this country in order to make the migrant communities welcome here. But if we listened to any member of the Labor Party, we would swear black and blue that the Liberal Party had nothing to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister came back here and said that the constitution was drawn up by `the British foreign office to look over the Australian government's shoulder'. It is just the same as this galah in the House of Representatives who said that the Union Jack was not on the flag in the First World War. He does not have the faintest idea of which way is up, let alone what our Australian history is. I think it is appalling that, day in and day out, in his quest to change Australia, without spelling out in what way he wishes to change Australia, the Prime Minister just goes out there and rewrites history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then starts to say the most patronising things, such as `our friendship for Britain would be all the stronger for our becoming a republic, as any friendship is stronger for being more mature'. Hear, hear! Why does not the Prime Minister get some maturity about him? Why does he not bring some maturity into this debate? Why does he not come before the Australian people and say, `This is my alternative'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has not the faintest idea what the alternative is. He wants change for change's sake and therein lies the problem. There are many people who are going to blindly follow this bloke without any consideration of whether it is in the best interests of Australia and Australians and what influence we have overseas. When the Prime Minister came back, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I explained to Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm affection felt towards her by the Australian people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>All except the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there was a growing feeling in Australia that constitutional changes should be made to allow the appointment of an Australian head of state."</PARA>
<PARA>Where is the growing feeling? Once again the Prime Minister goes overseas, flaps his gums and says something that is totally and utterly irrelevant to the people of Australia&mdash;and, I might say, Western Australia. The fact is that he goes overseas and says these things without any basis of fact whatsoever. The Prime Minister then said that other countries:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . have adopted a flag which now entirely and unambiguously represents that country.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any such debate here is characterised as preparing to tear down an Australian symbol, preparing to rip away at something. One question asked is why is the Prime Minister pushing the issue at this time? The answer is this; to make our way in the world and particularly this part of the world, we have to be entirely certain of who we are, what we are and what we wish to do."</PARA>

Yet people on the other side wish to tear that down, wish to destroy the fabric of Australian society. As the only Asian in this parliament I think I am in a better position to talk about what will cut the mustard in Asia than any of the rabble on the other side of the chamber. When I went to Singapore and Brunei they were all surprised that our head of state would denigrate our country overseas. They said that when their head of state went overseas he only promoted his country.

The French have had five goes at putting together a republic. These are the people whose first republic ended in a bloody tyranny and whose second republic replaced the restoration of the Bourbons. Then we had Napoleon's great-nephew who was appointed a dictator for 18 years until the Germans came in and gave the French republic another kick in the backside, another chance of life. Then we had the collapses under the Vichy government and now we have the fifth republic. Is this the sort of republic that these people on the other side of the chamber would have us have? Is this the sort of stable democracy that they want to see? Of course it is not the sort of stable democracy that we on this side of the chamber would like to see brought to fruition. We believe that we have a very stable and very proud democracy now. </PARA>

But we know not whether this would exist under a constitution which the other side would seek to foist on the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support one major contention of Senator O'Chee&mdash;that is, that the Liberal Party does support change to the constitution. That is one of my main purposes for speaking today. On this occasion, those opposite have chosen to adopt the traditional conservative position of wrapping themselves in the flag and referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a radical who wants to tear up our national symbols and our constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the debate on constitutional reform in Australia in recent years is that much of it has been led by the Liberal and National parties and other conservative forces. They are the ones who in recent times have been concerned about the interpretation of our constitution. Senator Kemp has been one of the loudest in his criticism of the lack of protection that Australia's constitution provides to Australian citizens for some of the basic fundamental democratic rights which he holds dear. In fact, Senator O'Chee, in seeking to talk about his Asian ancestry, failed to point out that for many years the constitution allowed legislation to exist which prevented Asians voting; that there exists no constitutional protection for their right to vote. I think that is an inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main tenet today&mdash;unfortunately, my speaking time is limited&mdash;is that the Prime Minister was quite correct in pointing out the British involvement in the development of our constitution. As a Western Australian, I am aware that in 1933 Western Australia sought to petition the British parliament in order to secede from the federation of Australia. So as late as 1933 there was an active attempt to get the British parliament to allow Western Australia to secede from the federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the criticisms of our current constitution do not come from the left of politics. They come from Richard Court; they come from Senator Kemp. They come from people who raise concerns about the increase in Commonwealth power, concerns about the influence of international treaties and the role of the UN on our sovereignty, and concerns about the High Court. The Western Australian President of the Liberal Party called the High Court racist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole range of concerns about constitutional developments in Australia are in fact raised by those on the conservative side of politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The amendments concern two separate topics. The first is age discrimination in setting junior rates. The second is termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Age discrimination</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would suspend for 3 years the age discrimination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act in relation to junior wage rates. This issue was foreshadowed in the Government's "Working Nation" white paper on employment and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions were included in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 as a result of amendments in the Senate in December last year. Although the Senate amendments required that junior wage rates be removed from all Federal awards as they are progressively reviewed under the Act by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, they did not allow for a transition period. These provisions are also creating difficulties for new agreements and awards, because some employers have not had sufficient time to adapt to the new requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has received representations suggesting that many parties, particularly those whose awards would be examined early in the first statutory review period, would not be able to adjust to the new requirements in time. The Government considers that an orderly change to competency based wages can be achieved within 3 years and regards this a reasonable transition period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that the existing requirements of the Act may create difficulties for that orderly transition, given that many parties appear to need more time to develop wage arrangements that pay workers on the basis of their skill and capacity rather than their age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will modify the effect of the four provisions in the Act that prevent age discrimination. They are to be suspended to the extent that they apply to discrimination because an employee has not reached a particular age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions concerned are for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to review all awards over a three year cycle beginning on 22 June 1994; for the Commission to certify agreements and to approve enterprise flexibility agreements; and a provision contained in the Act's principal object. The period of suspension in each case would correspond with the first 3 year cycle of award reviews under section 150A of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, this aspect of the age discrimination provisions would commence in relation to wage rates on 22 June 1997. All other grounds of award review would commence on 22 June 1994. This would result in the Commission's only applying the age discrimination element of section 150A in the second and subsequent 3-year cycles of award reviews. Similarly, agreements which contained wage rates that discriminated on the basis of age could not be approved or certified under the Act from 22 June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to the general policy of preventing and eliminating age discrimination. However, the Government has been persuaded that a suspension of the relevant provisions of the Act would facilitate the orderly introduction of more appropriate arrangements for junior rates. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Termination of employment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes provisions that relate to the termination of employment provisions of the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments, which were announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations on 30 May 1994, will change certain aspects of those provisions, namely:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">who is covered by the termination of employment provisions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the amounts of compensation that can be awarded by the Court; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where the onus of proof lies in proceedings before the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The termination of employment provisions are part of a safety net of statutory minimum entitlements for employees who do not have adequate alternative remedies. This protection is contained in Part VI A of the Industrial Relations Act which took effect on 30 March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly expressed, the existing termination of employment provisions of the Act have the following features.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Act, an employer must have a valid reason for dismissing an employee. That reason must be connected with the employee's conduct or capacity or the operational requirements of the employer's business. An employee must be allowed to respond to any alleged grounds of dismissal, except if the employer could not be reasonably expected to give that opportunity to the employee. Employees must be given specified periods of notice or pay in lieu of that notice, unless that is not reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act also prohibits dismissals on various discriminatory grounds. Some reasonable exceptions are allowed. There are also consultation and notification provisions in respect of redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If someone is sacked and wants to challenge the dismissal, the Industrial Relations Court can decide whether the dismissal was fair, unless there is an adequate alternative remedy available under other Federal or State laws. Conciliation occurs before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the usual case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If conciliation fails and the employer cannot justify the dismissal, under the current law the Court can order the employee's reinstatement or the payment of compensation or both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions are to be modified in the following ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will confine the termination provisions to employees who are either employed under a Federal or State award or whose base wage is no more than $60,000 per year. This amount is to be indexed annually by regulation to reflect increases in average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This restriction will not affect applications made to the Court before the bill is enacted. The exclusion of high income earners who are not covered by awards is intended to ensure that the Court's resources are fully available to address matters involving the lower paid and non-managerial employees who constitute the vast majority of the Australian workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a broader power to make regulations excluding categories of employees from the provisions about termination of employment, as allowed by the ILO Termination of Employment Convention. This will allow regulations to be made to exclude those cases where the application of the legislation is anomalous. An example is where the statutory notice provisions could apply in a way which is not consistent with employment arrangements for which special provision has already been made under an award.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be full consultation with interested parties before any regulations are made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed modifications will maintain the key objective of the current provisions, namely, to give employees protection against unfair dismissal. This is to be by reinstatement, or if that is not practicable, by fair compensation. The emphasis is on reinstatement in an unfairly dismissed employee's former position or one that has no less favourable terms. In such a case the Court will be able to make orders for the payment of any lost remuneration and to preserve the employee's continuity of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court will also be able to award compensation as an alternative, where reinstatement is impracticable. This condition is not meant to be narrowly construed. It is expected that the Court will have regard to the surrounding circumstances, such as the practical effect of reinstatement on the working relationship or the industrial consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation that is awarded instead of reinstatement is to be limited to an amount not exceeding six months' remuneration. For non-award employees, the compensation will be limited to an amount which does not exceed six months' remuneration or $30,000, whichever is the lower. This amount will also be indexed annually by regulation to reflect increases in average weekly earnings. This new limit on compensation will apply to all cases decided by the Court after this bill becomes law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus of proof in Court proceedings alleging unlawful dismissal is to be altered. The employer will only have the onus of establishing that the dismissal was for a valid reason. The applicant will have the onus of establishing any other elements of the case, including that a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers involved in proceedings before the Court about termination of employment will be given the right to be represented by any association of employers to which they belong. At present, only federally registered organisations of employers can represent their members in such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proceeding with these amendments in advance of a review of the practical operation of the Act scheduled for later this year. This action is being taken in direct response to some employers' views that the existing unfair dismissal provisions are an impediment to employment. The Government considers that the concerns expressed in some quarters about the legislation are exaggerated, particularly since the Court has yet to order compensation in any application under the existing provisions. Even so, it is not acceptable for the termination of employment provisions to be perceived as an impediment to the recovery of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also appears that a number of claims have been made in the Court in anticipation of more generous awards of compensation than have been available in other jurisdictions. This is not consistent with the purpose of these provisions which is to guarantee adequate forms of protection for people who do not otherwise have them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments should also assist in ensuring that proceedings before the Court are not delayed by unnecessary arguments about the adequacy of alternative remedies or arguments about the validity of extremely large claims for compensation. The Government considers that the amendments will ensure that the provisions operate fairly and effectively, particularly for ordinary Australian employees who require the protection of the law against the unfair termination of their employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Low-alcohol Wine) Amendment Bill 1994 is the last step in a nine-month process which finally moves us back to the sales tax position which low alcohol wine, cider and other products enjoyed on 17 August 1993. I remind the Senate that this bill is not about equity; it is just a correction of a poorly thought out money making measure which was part of the 1993 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, which implements a proposal announced in the 1994-95 budget, will reduce the rate of sales tax on low alcohol wine and similar low alcohol beverages from 12 per cent to the concessional rate of 11 per cent. Goods are taken to be low alcohol if they contain less than 1.15 per cent by volume alcohol. In addition, the bill will remove the 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1995 rate increases which sought to increase the rate to 14 per cent and then to 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The low alcohol beverages falling under the auspices of this bill are wine, cider and beverages similar to wine or cider, as well as mead, perry, sake and other fermented beverages, whether sourced from Australia or from overseas. They are targeted at the health and diet conscious and perhaps those of us who are very conscious about drink driving. All of us in this place should be strongly encouraging the consumption of low alcohol beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale given by the government for the reduction in the rate is to align the rate with that applying to carbonated beverages consisting wholly of Australian fruit or vegetable juice and to non-carbonated beverages consisting of at least 25 per cent Australian fruit or vegetable juice. If the government had not embarked upon its ridiculous campaign in 1993, hotly in pursuit of revenue, we would not be wasting our time here today dealing with this so-called realignment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the contribution made by one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), in bringing about this change. Following the 1993 budget, he brought to everybody's attention the massive sales tax hike on these products. I understand that his South Australian electorate is the one most affected by this bill and the acts that it amends. I commend my colleague Neil Andrew for the constructive role that he played in bringing about this realignment and drawing attention to the anomalies and the absurdities resulting from the 1993 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1993 budget, low alcohol wine products attracted sales tax at the rate of 10 per cent; that is, the same rate as their major competitors on the supermarket shelf. From 18 August 1993 the rate of sales tax on low alcohol wine, cider and other similar products jumped to 21 per cent, giving their competitors, who remained relatively unscathed by the budget&mdash;having attracted a sales tax of only one per cent&mdash;a distinct price advantage. Instead of encouraging demand, that measure could only be said to have torpedoed demand. We are all price sensitive consumers, no matter how health conscious we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation did not last long. There was intense coalition and industry pressure. Some sense was restored to the situation when in October last year the rate returned to the current rate of 12 per cent by virtue of the three acts this bill amends: the Sales Tax (Customs) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act 1993, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act 1993 and the Sales Tax (General) (Wine-Deficit Reduction) Act 1993. However, low alcohol wine and cider still faced distinctive sales tax advantage relative to the carbonated grape juice products with which they competed. The differential would have been aggravated by the projected sales tax increases over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are all aware, many of the 1993-94 budget measures met with public disapproval&mdash;so much so that we lost former Treasurer John Dawkins over the fiasco of it. The government sought not only to increase wine tax by 55 per cent but also to increase sales tax on de-alcoholised wines by 110 per cent. As Mr Andrew highlighted at the time, the 1993 budget paper proposals included lifting sales tax on low alcohol beverages from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no reservations about this&mdash;nor about any&mdash;tax decrease. However, we are highly critical of the government for failing to adequately address the repercussions of its budgetary measures. It is not clear whether the low alcohol wine fiasco was a deliberate government decision or an unintended consequence of a rushed and poorly prepared budget. I hope that it was the latter and that the government has learnt from its mistakes. Unfortunately, I am not confident that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year this government's wine taxes were inequitable and its taxation bills were thrown out of this place in need of overhauling. This year, instead, we have overly optimistic forecasts, which I believe could jeopardise Australia's future by exposing us to the high risk of high inflation and high interest rates through some absurdly over-optimistic figures, including investment estimates. I compliment Neil Andrew, my colleague from the other house, for his instrumental and constructive role in bringing about these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, this bill will not result in a huge loss to Commonwealth revenue. In fact, the loss to revenue in 1994-95 will be in the order of $400,000, which is peanuts compared to the sales tax revenue estimates for 1994 of $10.35 billion. Even taking into account the loss arising from the removal of the 1 July 1995 and 1 July 1996 rate increases, the loss to revenue over the next two years will be only $1.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill shows how the government pulled the wool over Australians' eyes during the election lead-up. Paul Keating's famous words, `There will be no new taxes. That is l-a-w, law,' will survive in the memory of all Australians as the biggest lie in the election lead-up. In that budget the Labor Party threw those promises to the wind and bludgeoned producers of low alcohol products about the head by saying that sales tax would increase from the existing level of 10 per cent to a massive 21 per cent. I remind the Senate that this tax decrease will be very short lived&mdash;in fact, from 11 May 1994 to 1 July 1995, when the rate will rise back to 12 per cent, in line with the scheduled increase in the sales tax rates which were budgeted previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by expressing my disgust at the fact that this bill has been largely a waste of the chamber's time. It should have been remedied a lot earlier. In fact, it should never have occurred in the first place. It is plainly and simply the result of the government's slapdash approach to taxation. I cannot condone this decrease in tax because this bill is not about equity in any shape or form; it is purely about helping to restore the status quo created by a tornado in the shape of the 1993 budget. However, the opposition will be supporting the measure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure has been warmly received by Australia's manufacturers of low alcohol wine, ciders and similar products. In particular, the management and staff of the Chateau Yaldara winery in South Australia are very relieved, as the company was severely disadvantaged by the sales tax situation that arose as a result of the budget decisions last year. Chateau Yaldara is one of Australia's largest producers of low alcohol beverages, including well-known products such as Grapella, Spumante and Lambrusco. Because many of Chateau Yaldara's low alcohol products are alcohol removed, they have been treated as wine for sales tax purposes. The wine tax changes that resulted from last year's budget had already seen sales tax on Chateau Yaldara's products jump to 12 per cent, with that rate scheduled to increase to 14 per cent on 1 July next year and 16 per cent in 1996. </PARA>

In fact, it has reported the loss of some of its market share because of this tax anomaly. Today's legislation rights that wrong. It returns low alcohol wine to the concessional tax rate of 11 per cent and removes the future increases that were to go up as far as 16 per cent by 1996. The bill means that competition for sales of low alcohol wine and cider in Australia returns to an equal footing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill 1994, as its title implies, abolishes the Automotive Industry Authority and, in doing so, implements yet another plank of the coalition's policies because the abolition of the authority was a part of the coalition's election policy proposals. The bill abolishes the authority for the very simple reason, with which the coalition obviously agrees, that the authority has outlived its usefulness. Indeed, one could question whether the authority should have been established in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the authority has now outlived the purpose for which it was established; namely, to guide the automotive industry through the changes imposed on it in the early 1980s by the government's car plan, which was a successor plan to several other car plans of the earlier Liberal-National Party governments going back to the 1960s. In 1984 the government made significant changes to the car plan and the Automotive Industry Authority was established for the purposes of guiding the industry through those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) said in his second reading speech, the focus of the car plan was on industry restructuring and the promotion of an internationally competitive automotive manufacturing industry. I will come back to that a little later. He went on to say in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reviews in 1988 and 1991 have maintained this approach through the continuation of a policy of reduced assistance complemented by various mechanisms to promote rationalisation and increased economies of scale from export production.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say for the record that the government's tariff policy towards the automotive industry is the same as the coalition's policy, so there is a bipartisan approach on that matter. There are other aspects of policy that involve directly&mdash;or more particularly indirectly&mdash;the automotive industry along with any other manufacturing industry on which we have some considerably different policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the authority does not appear any longer to provide a worthwhile, ongoing role which does not duplicate departmental responsibility or industry bodies. It makes sense that the proposed abolition of the authority include provisions for the ongoing functions of the authority that are worth while&mdash;and there are some&mdash;to be consolidated into relevant areas within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The abolition of the authority is going to lead to ongoing annual savings of approximately $600,000 a year, according to the government. The authority's budget this year of $1.1 million will be used for the costs of closing down the authority and related issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see the advances that have been made by the automotive industry in recent years. On behalf of the coalition, I take this opportunity to congratulate the industry on the significant achievements that it has made. The productivity performance has been notable in recent years. The report of the automotive industry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the State of the Automotive Industry 1993</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in the parliament just a couple of months ago, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 17 per cent improvement in productivity in 1993 . . . brings the improvement in the last two years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>1992 and 1993&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to 31 per cent, is a very strong performance and complements the quality improvement which became evident a couple of years ago.</PARA>
<PARA>The authority, in the report to which I have just referred&mdash;in fact in its preceding report&mdash;identified the industry's success in closing the quality gap between local and imported cars, as measured by owner-identified faults. It also reported at that time that the best of the Australian cars had achieved quality levels better than some imported Japanese vehicles, and that the quality measures for 1993 confirmed that improvement with the majority of local models showing further gains in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all very noteworthy developments so far as the industry is concerned&mdash;and the industry ought to be complimented on them. Not so favourable are some of the other developments that were pointed out by the Automotive Industry Authority in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the State of the Automotive Industry 1993</EMPHASIS>. In particular, it is a matter of concern to see the authority reporting that car affordability has declined and deteriorated progressively since 1984. In other words, it costs more in real terms for people to buy a car now than it did a decade ago. That has been a major contributor to the very static market that we have for vehicles in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take total sales into account, we have had virtually no increase in the passenger vehicle market for something like 20 years. The average age of vehicles in Australia is now one of the oldest in the world&mdash;the latest figures I have seen show an average vehicle age of the order of 15 to 17 years. With that sort of situation major problems are posed not only for consumers but also for the environment because many cars on Australian roads are running on leaded rather than unleaded petrol. There is little incentive in a static market for the capital investment that is needed if we are to see a vibrant local industry in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 report of the automotive industry pointed out again the poor profitability performance of the industry over the last decade and made the very important point that that poor performance has been caused by more than just cyclical variations. As the report points out, it is surprising that there has been the level of investment in the industry over the last decade, given the overall state of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely essential that we create in Australia&mdash;not just for the automotive industry but, because it is a significant part of our manufacturing sector, particularly for the automotive industry&mdash;the climate that will encourage an even more efficient and, in particular, internationally competitive industry than we have now. The industry has done a lot to lift its own game. I am sure&mdash;and having spoken to people in the industry, I know they would agree&mdash;that there is more the industry can do and wants to do, as well. But to a very important extent the onus is also on government to provide the conditions and environment, in terms of micro-economic reform, that will enable and encourage the industry&mdash;and give it the confidence necessary&mdash;to go ahead into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great concerns I have about the state of the Australian economy&mdash;and it is an economy-wide concern&mdash;is that this government has given every sign that it has gone to sleep on micro-economic reform and believes that there is no more it can do. There could be no more worrying sign of the complacency and arrogance of this government in terms of its policy performance than that. We will all rue the day very dearly if we do not make the necessary micro-economic reforms that are so patently and obviously needed. It is not just a matter of federal government reforms&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my concern extends to state governments as well as the federal government. There are some notable exceptions. Senator Schacht is a South Australian and he is starting to see the necessary changes there. But if he came to my state of Victoria and saw what the Kennett government has been doing by way of reform in Victoria, it would give him confidence that state governments, if they have the will and courage to bite the bullet, really can achieve major improvements through reforms which give investors and consumers confidence in the future of their economy. I congratulate the Victorian government in particular on what it has been doing there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the industry that is of concern&mdash;and again this is a combination of government and industry&mdash;is the fact that the industrial relations performance across the automotive sector has not been good in the last year or so, as reported in the industry authority's report on the industry for 1993. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time since 1989 the level of disputation in the automotive sector&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in 1993&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was greater than that for all of manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a great concern. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A continuation of the deterioration evident over the last two years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in industrial relations performance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>While there have been significant improvements in the industry over recent years&mdash;we congratulate all those concerned within the industry for those achievements&mdash;it is very important to note that there is still a long way to go on the part of the industry but, more particularly, on the part of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill. The purpose of the bill is to abolish the Automotive Industry Authority. In a broad sense, the functions of the authority will be picked up by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority was established in 1984 to oversee and monitor implementation of the car plan. The plan involved industry restructuring to achieve an `internationally competitive automotive manufacturing sector' and involved progressive reductions in tariff protection from 57.5 per cent to 30 per cent or thereabouts currently. By the year 2000 the tariff rate will be 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major elements of the car plan include a duty free allowance whereby imported components representing up to 15 per cent of the wholesale value of the final product of the car can be imported duty free. This is intended to encourage local car production. It also includes an export facilitation scheme whereby the value added component of automotive export earnings is calculated. This figure is then used to calculate a duty rebate which can be claimed by the exporter when importing automotive products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority's role has been the administration of these schemes, apart from those aspects which are handled through Customs, and to monitor industry competitiveness. It has provided commentary on a range of policy issues, the major example being the effects on the industry of the importation of second-hand cars and helping to deal with the Nissan plant closure, statistical services and, importantly, an annual `state of the industry report', which has been called a `bible' by industry representatives, and which has been of great use to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority was established with a sunset clause which was to take effect in 1992. However, the 1990 Industry Commission inquiry into the automotive industry found that the authority had played a very useful role in promoting achievement of the government's objectives for the industry and had encouraged cooperation between the various sectors of the industry. The commission concluded that the authority had served a useful purpose in providing independent information and advice when the government has had to consider representations from the industry, and that it could see merit in a body continuing to provide such information and advice for the duration of the post-1992 assistance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission recommended that for the duration of the post-1992 assistance arrangements&mdash;that is, until the year 2000&mdash;a body be established to provide independent information and advice on the industry and to undertake administrative functions in the export facilitation arrangement. As a result of this recommendation, the government passed legislation in the 1992 budget session, which was supported by the Australian Democrats but opposed by the opposition&mdash;that is, less than two years ago&mdash;to extend the life of the authority until the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no advance warning that the move to abolish the authority was afoot until it was announced in the white paper. The white paper also announced that there would be a further review of the car industry in 1996 regarding assistance arrangements to apply post-2000. It is estimated&mdash;and this is a significant point&mdash;that the abolition of the authority would save about $600,000 per year commencing in 1995-96. To save that amount, the government is prepared to withdraw a body which has provided, and is continuing to provide, useful, independent monitoring and research in the further development of the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from having talked to staff of the authority that only about three or four of the 10 or 11 staff have been offered positions in the department. The rest will have to be relocated somewhere else in the Public Service and their level of expertise and competence in matters related to the car industry will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point we should note that the car industry is not compartmentalised into just the activities that it is engaged in. Some 11 industries supply parts, components and various materials to this industry and it therefore occupies an extremely important strategic position in Australian manufacturing industry. This decision, which the government has made with such unseemly haste without consulting either the industry or the staff of the authority, must therefore be viewed with some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues are involved, the first being the one I started to deal with: that in neither the second reading speech nor the white paper was any lucid reason, any justification, given for the abolition of the authority. The relevant part of the second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key issue now is whether the industry is able to continue to improve its competitiveness within the existing policy framework and administrative arrangements under the Car Plan. Many of these factors that affect the industry's competitiveness cut across a number of Commonwealth Portfolios and may require a response at State level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that as a result of the reviews undertaken in 1988 and 1991, the policy and administrative structure itself has become progressively less complex. The direction for automotive policy is to work with the industry to not only monitor its response to existing policy but to also address the basic industry development and business environment issues which impact on its performance. The decision to repeal the Automotive Industry Authority Act reflects these changing demands.</PARA>
<PARA>This is gobbledegook. As far as I can tell, the real reasons for the abolition are: cost cutting; the department's obvious desire to take over the functions of the authority&mdash;in other words, bureaucratic infighting; and the view that the hard bits of the car implementation plan are done and that the task is therefore an administratively simpler one in that the industry grants program is over but the export facilitation scheme work load is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument obviously disregards the strategic importance of the industry and the fact that the world does not stand still, that there are new challenges ahead, that this industry is playing a very important part in Australia's manufacturing industries and that we could achieve much greater improvements and much greater advances in many directions in this industry&mdash;for instance, in the direction of achieving the manufacture of cars which are less damaging to the environment and which use less fuel. There are many things that could and should be done, and it is regrettable that we see here a retreat from what should be part of our industry policy&mdash;that is, the development of sector specific industry policy statements and plans. That cannot be stated often enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be said that it is obviously inefficient to have a car industry policy managed by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology which has very much a one-sided government view by definition and which is under the authority of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook. We might recall that only a couple of weeks ago the minister suggested that the staff of another statutory authority, the CSIRO, should be prevented from making statements to other political parliamentary representatives which could be critical of the government's operations. I wonder whether the minister's desire to control the development of a particular industry without any independent feedback, without any independent consultation and without any independent contribution to the development of that industry from within the industry, from the community, might not be a major factor in his having brought about this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other factor needs addressing, and that is the appalling way in which this decision has been made without consultation with the staff of the authority who have worked competently and loyally for many years. This is a factor that must be addressed irrespective of the rights and wrongs of the abolition of the authority. To all appearances, the staff of the authority have been treated like dirt. As I understand it, the consultation process consisted of the chief executive of the authority being told, after the decision had been made and a few days before it was announced in the white paper, that the authority was to be abolished. There was even new carpet for the office on order at the time the decision was made. The lease on the building had just been extended for five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority was not given a chance to put its position, and staff are understandably angry and upset. Some 10 or 11 staff are affected. This sort of happening is a good example of why the Public Service is thoroughly demoralised. We should remember that the federal government and federal government owned business enterprises have shed over 80,000 jobs over the last three years and have caused many more to be shed at state level. These 10 or 11 people are people with families and with career aspirations&mdash;in other words, people whose positions should have been taken into account and who should have been consulted before a decision was reached. Three or four of the staff are getting positions in the department, but the rest have to take pot luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We perhaps should put ourselves in the position of the staff. They have worked hard, and their work has been complimented by parliament, by the industry, and even by the Industry Commission&mdash;and that may come as a surprise given the record of the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission recommended that the authority be extended until the year 2000. In response, the government legislated so to extend it. The employees felt secure in their jobs and enjoyed their jobs. Perhaps they had even relocated their family home closer to work on the basis that they were going to be there for some time to come. They were interested in the car industry and had invested time and effort in becoming professionals in the car industry, in learning about it and in making contacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, out of the blue, they were told their jobs had been abolished. They did not know where they would be redeployed, and they will not know for some time. There is a good chance that redeployment will be into a job that is not suited to their capacity, dealing with subject matter they are not competent in, and about which they have no particular interest or expertise. It may even be in a distant suburb or in another city. Clearly, all of this would be stressful and demoralising for them, and they would certainly question whether there was any real appreciation of the hard work and loyalty they had shown. And this has been done by a Labor government&mdash;one which believes in industrial democracy and consultation with workers. The minister may as well be a conservative and sit on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect needs to be looked at. The bill represents a cutback in resources devoted to the car industry, and that will affect the quality of advice, the quality of research and the quality and level of knowledge available on the car industry on the basis of which strategic forward plans can be constructed. Very obviously the move will mean a reduction in the quality and quantity of research and monitoring in the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence I foreshadow the amendment that has already been circulated in the chamber which seeks to ensure that reports to parliament on the industry, in line with the report that was being produced on an annual basis by the authority, will be continued. The authority people know the industry better than the automotive branch of the department. There will be a loss of policy continuity, but let us at least make sure that the basic knowledge and the basic material on which decisions will have to be made in the future continue to be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to say that this is a rather bizarre decision given that the recommendations of previous inquiries have been that the industry authority should continue and that it would continue to provide useful services. One would have to question the government's continuing commitment to the car industry plan and, in particular, to the concept of sectoral planning. As I have already said, if we are to ensure that our industries remain competitive in the international marketplace we must look at each industry sector, we must assess what the opportunities are and we must develop an information base which enables us to advance these industries to produce innovative products and to achieve a position that is competitive based on quality, based on a type of product that in this particular area&mdash;the area of cars&mdash;takes account of environmental factors and that can take us to the forefront of development. From this point of view the decision that the government has made&mdash;the decision that is represented by this bill, which is, not surprisingly, supported by the opposition&mdash;is a retrograde step. </PARA>

It says we will simply serve international investors without inquiring what they will invest in.

If we have the chance, we should implement changes to ameliorate a situation which occurs. Because the automotive industry is of particular importance in the way in which we design our cities, in our levels of emissions, in our energy use and so on, we believe it is extremely important that there is a policy line and a means by which policy can be implemented in this area. </PARA>

I believe those exports are alone a testament to the success of the government's policies since 1983 in reducing unnecessary protection and tariffs, and encouraging industry to become export oriented and, therefore, to meet the quality requirements that are necessary to be an export oriented industry. The export enhancement program has been central to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that if one had said to people in South Australia in 1981-82 that we would be exporting fully made cars from South Australia to Europe, Japan and North America, they would have said that one should be taken away and locked up for a substantial amount of time. It was beyond the comprehension of Australians to believe we could beat or match the best in the world with regard to cars and car exports. We are now doing that with great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year there has been an announcement by Mitsubishi that it will spend $400 million to $500 million on upgrading its South Australian plants in order to build the next generation of the Magna and the Verada. General Motors Holden's has just commissioned a new paint plant at Elizabeth worth well in excess of $100 million to give the Commodores, et cetera, that they produce there a quality of paintwork which matches the best in the world. We are still waiting for an announcement&mdash;there has been some indication&mdash;that over the next year the Elizabeth plant of General Motors will become the major base for the export of cars to South-East Asia. Again, that is beyond what people would have thought possible only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very proud of the success of its policy in the car industry. Particular credit must be paid to former Senator Button, the former industry minister who proposed and developed this industry policy in conjunction with the industry&mdash;both the employers and the unions. There has been a sea change in attitude on both sides of the industry on issues of quality, industrial relations and training. There is a much more consensus oriented approach to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special tribute should be paid to the car industry unions which have accepted the challenge to become an export oriented industry, to become world best. They have accepted that tariffs should be reduced substantially. I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a former metal worker, that if one had said to you in the 1970s that Australian trade unions would accept reductions in tariffs and the protective level that then existed, you would probably have thought it was a very long shot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions have accepted that challenge. They have to be congratulated on the culture change that they have accepted. They now have an industry which they can be proud of. I visited the General Motors Fishermens Bend plant only a month or so ago when it celebrated the export of the two millionth engine from Australia. When I saw the hundreds and hundreds of workers showing great pride in what they had achieved, and the way they enjoyed the celebration of what is a remarkable achievement for the manufacturing industry in Australia, I realised that this industry does have a strong future in this country, a future which this government is dedicated to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler basically expressed a view that he did not support the repeal of the authority because there was still work to be done. The industry plan has been going for more than 10 years and there is a well-defined plan for the next few years. We know that there will be a review in 1997 of what tariffs should be post-2000, when we get to the 15 per cent level. But we believe that all of that can be done within the resources of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. It does not need the continuation of the Automotive Industry Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the initial cost of winding down the authority, we will achieve savings of around $600,000 per annum which will be available to the department for other programs. Of course, we will continue to ensure that, within the department, there are resources available to monitor, consult with the industry and advise the government accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Spindler, I pay tribute to those many officers in the authority who have ensured that the industry plan has been carried out with such great success over the last decade. I also pay tribute to those in the department for their work and their relationship with the industry. The government believes that we can wind down this authority without any diminution of the effectiveness of the government's policy. The authority can take considerable credit for the success of the government's policies over the last decade. Accordingly, the government asks the Senate to support the bill without the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>As I said during the second reading debate on the Automotive Industry Authority Repeal Bill, I believe this is an important industry. It is important that the industry, the government and this parliament receive independent advice based on knowledge and research. Frankly, I am not satisfied that we will receive independent advice through the department of a minister who has a record of trying to muzzle the staff of an authority which is also within the bailiwick of his particular responsibilities. If anything, that particular unhappy occurrence in relation to the CSIRO has demonstrated that we need relatively independent statutory authorities to provide unbiased advice and information to this parliament, the government and the industry. I commend the amendment to the chamber. </PARA>

Over the last few years, the authority has played an important role. The staff have done their job well and conscientiously. I hope that, from a staffing point of view, things work out for them. I know that some will be going to the department and that others will be going to other jobs. I want to add the coalition's voice of thanks to the staff of the authority over the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to put on the record that, whilst I understand the point that Senator Spindler is attempting to make with his amendment, the coalition will not be supporting the amendment. It seems to us that, if we were to agree to an amendment of this nature in relation to the automotive industry, why should we not have the same for every industry which either is subject to a sectoral plan or is not subject to a sectoral plan? There are alternative ways of reporting to the parliament on the state of the industry. We are in the process of upgrading the significance of annual reports. I note the minister's undertaking that the department will have a significant segment on the industry in its annual report. We think that is the appropriate way to go and for that reason, we will not be supporting the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up another point made by Senator Spindler. He said that this is an important industry and that therefore we need this type of amendment. The implication is that, if we do not support this amendment then we do not think the automotive industry is important. I have to categorically say that, from the coalition's point of view, that quite frankly does not make much sense. We have reiterated time and time again the importance of this industry. We regard it, as it quite patently is, as the most important manufacturing industry in Australia. We hope that it will thrive and become more internationally competitive in an environment that is provided for it to be healthy and a strong investor of both capital and jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In declining to support the Australian Democrats' amendment, the coalition again wants to put it on the record that we do regard the automotive industry as very important.

It even leaves Senator Schacht behind. Whilst sharing Senator Spindler's view, the fact is that the government has given an undertaking that a significant segment will be contained in the annual report of the department. That report is subject to the full scrutiny of the parliament. As we are all aware, it is expected that annual reports will play an increasingly important role in the estimates process, particularly the additional estimates process later in the year. So I think the minister will be held accountable in that sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked what we are going to do to help the industry. I can tell Senator Spindler a couple of things that I would do to help the industry. I would lower fuel taxes rather than increase them. I would lower the costs and imposts on business that are a core part of the Australian Democrats' economic policies, almost all of which have the effect, both directly and indirectly, of making the Australian economy and therefore major industries, such as the car industry, less able to compete, less able to become more productive, less able to provide jobs and investment, less able to export and less able to be able to compete with imports. In other words, they are less able to survive in the internationally competitive world which, whether the Democrats like it or not, we live in today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of reporting to parliament in the way proposed in the Democrats' amendment is totally irrelevant when weighed against the very damaging policies that the Democrats put forward.

The industry is well noted for its public profile.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Pooled Development Funds Act of 1992 in accordance with the changes announced in the government's white paper on 4 May. This bill complements similar changes that were recently enacted in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the government announced several changes in its white paper on 4 May. Firstly, it reduced the concessional tax rate from 25 to 15 per cent for investments in small to medium sized enterprises. Secondly, it removed the five per cent restriction on investment in start-up ventures. Thirdly, it raised the limits on investments in any one project from 20 to 30 per cent. Fourthly, it raised the limit on individual ownership of a pooled development fund from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. Fifthly, it granted the Pooled Development Fund Registration Board Authority to allow higher limits of ownership or project investment above the set 30 per cent, including the power to revoke permission where board proscribed conditions are not met by the Pooled Development Fund. Sixthly, it enabled the Pooled Development Fund to invest in companies with assets of up to $50 million, as opposed to the $30 million restriction contained in the existing act. Finally, it increased the proportion of funds which must be invested in small to medium sized companies from 50 per cent to 65 per cent to obtain the lower concessional tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those measures are to take effect from 1 July. The tax measures were included in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and they are estimated to cost up to $4 million in future years. The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill includes the operational and definitional changes to the pooled development fund scheme. As such, this bill is not estimated to have any financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pooled development fund scheme, the PDF scheme, was firstly proposed in the government's One Nation statement back in February 1992. It was established in June of that year. The proposal was intended as one way of overcoming perceived funds shortages for small to medium sized businesses. The scheme has been amended on more than one occasion since then. By any measure, the Pooled Development Fund proposal constitutes another quite abject failure by this government to implement its One Nation proposals of February 1992. They were rushed out at great speed, absolutely not thought through and were a panic measure in response to the coalition's policy document that had been released a couple of months earlier&mdash;the Fightback document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) admitted the failure of the pooled development fund scheme. Honourable senators may recall that the scheme was designed to encourage investment running into hundreds of millions of dollars. There were very great rhetorical proposals advocated in terms of the likely success of it and the government sailed into the 1993 election claiming that this was going to be a great success and that there were huge investment proposals in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know now that that was a total lie and that the PDF scheme has been an abject failure. The minister, in his second reading speech, admitted this when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds, as only $35 million has been raised by PDFs.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the minister, if he is listening, will in his response at the end of this debate be able to update the Senate on just how many PDFs there actually are. As of last year, I understand there were only three related green chip companies that had successfully listed on the stock market. Another three or four approved applications have not been able to get to the market yet, but perhaps we can get a full update when the minister replies. This scheme, like so many others in the hastily concocted, panic driven One Nation statement of a couple of years ago, has failed to live up to its exalted claims in a quite spectacular and abject way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, when he announced the One Nation package, made quite enormous and fanciful promises as to what was going to be achieved. It was going to be the statement to end all statements. It was going to solve all Australia's economic problems and lead us back onto the path of prosperity from which we had been very rudely thrown by the policy incompetence and failures of the government. As a result of those failures, the government had to engineer the recession, which proved to be the greatest recession of the last 60 years and which threw almost one million Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap. We should never forget that that was the result of the recession that we had to have. Of course it was not a recession that we had to have. The government and the Prime Minister, then Treasurer, used that as a blatant excuse to try to cover up the enormous policy failures that had led to that situation. He said that One Nation was going to do a huge range of things and solve all our problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at some of the absurd claims that were made in the One Nation Statement. I remind the Senate that it is not much more than a couple of years ago that these statements and assertions were made. Firstly, the budget was going to be in surplus by 1995-96. Secondly, there was going to be a $5 billion tax cut in the second tranche of tax cuts, and One Nation itself proposed tax cuts of approximately $8.3 billion in two tranches, the second of which was in excess of $5 billion and that was going to be delivered in 1995-96. There were going to be 800,000 new jobs by 1996. The unemployment rate was going to be down to 8.25 per cent by this year&mdash;by 1994. There was going to be an avalanche of new investment&mdash;it was claimed by the government that $130 billion was likely to result from the 10 per cent development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pooled development funds scheme that we are now amending was also going to provide huge benefits. We were going to have the sale of Qantas; increased aviation competition; a national electricity grid; foreign branch banking and the establishment of effective offshore banking units; so-called infrastructure bonds, which were never going to work anyway but we were going to have them; a national rail network, which is still struggling, and so on. In the One Nation statement a total of no less than $16.6 billion worth of new promises were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to compare that situation with what has resulted and where we are now. Now we have still got 10 per cent unemployment&mdash;900,000 people still unemployed. Far from tax cuts, we had massive tax hikes in last year's budget. Despite those massive tax hikes in last year's budget which are flowing through in this year's budget and resulting in huge increases in the government's revenue, we will still have in the year to come, 1994-95, a budget deficit of approximately $12 billion. We will have a projected Commonwealth debt of $95 billion within the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the second tranche of the personal income tax cuts literally abandoned&mdash;thrown out the window. They have been put back to 1998, and that is never-never land. Those tax cuts are never going to be delivered. We have seen virtually no increase in investment in this country in the last four years. The government claims that we will get a 14 1/2 per cent increase in investment in the coming year, and 18 per cent in plant and equipment. Those figures are very optimistic; I am not saying that they are totally unachievable but they are highly optimistic. The point is that even if those increases occurred, we would still be further behind than where we were four years ago and it would be a pale shadow of the increase in investment as we came out of the 1982-83 recession. The investment situation is still clouded and is certainly not one from which we can derive great hope and promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have today the lowest household savings rate of 3 1/2 per cent. Never in our statistically recorded history have we had a savings rate that low. If we do not have domestic savings in the economy we do not get investment and/or we get low investment and a huge increase in the foreign debt. That is precisely what this government has achieved. We now have a net foreign debt of $170,000 million, figures that are incomprehensible to the average Australian and figures which even five years ago, let alone 10 years ago, no Australian would have thought could possibly happen in this nation. It is the highest per capita foreign debt of any nation on earth, including the largest of the debtor Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment of the government's policies, and in particular the promises and the rhetoric of the One Nation statement of a little more than two years, is that it is what we said it was going to be at the time, and that is just another huge propaganda exercise that has done nothing whatsoever to assist Australians or Australia in bettering themselves and our nation. What we have seen instead is an increase in, and continuation of, the hardship that has plagued virtually all Australians, but not the really rich because the rich have got richer in this country whilst the poor have got poorer. What we have seen as a result of this government's policies is a divisiveness in our society for economic and other reasons that is very damaging to the whole social fabric of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a government which parades itself as a paragon of virtue in terms of its approach to social justice and access and equity, those words are monstrous hypocrisy. When you consider the harsh reality of what this government has achieved in its term of office, quite the opposite is the case. In Australia today for most Australians life is much harder and the prospects much less promising than they were a decade ago. We have to turn this country around. We have to give it hope and confidence so that we can save, so that we can invest, so that we can create more jobs and increase income and wealth, so that we have a national cake which can be shared so that all Australians are better off as a result. We will never get that under this government. That has been proved by 10 hard years of policy failure. It is well beyond time that this nation had a major change in policy direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill is just one very small part of the government's policy failures. The opposition will not be opposing the bill because the bill does make some changes which are pluses rather than minuses. But the bill, and the whole concept of pooled development funds, were never going to do what was claimed of them. The sooner the government comes up with sensible economic policies the better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is today discussing the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994. The bill gives effect to the changes to pooled development funds announced in the white paper, with the exception of the reduction in the concessional tax rate from 25 to 15 per cent, which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has stated will be introduced shortly in separate legislation. While I do not necessarily agree with every point made by Senator Short in the wide-ranging policy speech he has delivered, I certainly agree that this bill does not go far enough. The changes are minor. They are designed to free up the operational rules applying to PDFs, specifically to increase from $30 million to $50 million the total asset limit of companies in which a PDF may invest, to increase from 20 to 30 per cent the proportion of its capital that a PDF may invest in any one business, to remove the restriction that PDFs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises, to increase the limit on the level of ownership an investor may acquire in a PDF from 20 to 30 per cent&mdash;banks and life offices are excluded&mdash;and to increase from 50 per cent to 65 per cent the level of a PDF's funds that must be invested in eligible companies within a prescribed period of five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this bill is that in 1984 the Espie committee concluded, `Australia is doing very little to encourage the development of high growth potential, high technology knowledge enterprises,' noting that internationally most other OECD governments supported venture and development capital initiatives. The result was the management investment corporation scheme, which offered a 100 per cent tax deduction for `patient' capital&mdash;that is, longer than four-year investment&mdash;in designated companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme had problems but was successful in generating some $300 million-plus in risk capital through to the late 1980s. Even now some of the MICs are reporting success stories. The scheme was terminated in 1990. By that stage there was evidence that the venture and development capital market had contracted. Risk capital had developed a bad name through the 1987 crash, treasury successfully undermining the MIC tax concession for institutional investors with a bizarre ruling in late 1986 and through poor regulation of `second board' activities on the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;although it must be admitted that some rorts in that sector certainly took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 in the One Nation statement the government announced tax concessions for pooled development funds. Funds investing in eligible companies would be subject to only a 30 per cent tax rate and all capital gains on shareholding in the PDFs or on dividends would be tax free. It is to be noted that PDFs are development capital rather than venture capital funds. Most of the investment is through listed shares. Until these changes there was a limit of five per cent on the amount of its funds that a PDF could invest in start-up companies, a limitation that is difficult to understand. Certainly we welcome the removal of that regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years later only three PDFs have raised money. Total raisings are only $35 million. The tax concession was dropped from 30 per cent to 25 per cent some time ago. As I have said before, in the white paper it was announced that it would be dropped to 15 per cent. Apart from the rate not being concessional enough, the failure of the scheme to attract funds was attributed to rules which were too tight. Hence the changes in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues relating to this bill fall into two categories, those relating to the changes in the bill and those that have been foreshadowed, and those relating to the entire approach to venture and development capital. While it is not part of this bill, the new concessional rate which has been foreshadowed in the white paper is not concessional enough. Due to dividend imputation, superannuation funds pay effective tax rates of well under 15 per cent, so a concessional tax rate of 15 per cent is no concession at all and is unlikely to encourage superannuation funds to invest in PDFs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greenchip Management Pty Ltd, which runs two of the three active PDFs, argues that the size restriction for eligible investee companies should be based on market valuation rather than total assets. This is the basis on which the market makes investment decisions. By using total assets, some firms with total assets of more than $50 million but with market valuations of less than $50 million will still not be able to access capital. That is, major institutional investors do not look below $50 million market valuations, while PDFs are not able to service those above $50 million total assets. That means that some firms are in never-never land between the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PDFs also face restrictions on the buyback of shares. Issuants of rights and options are apparently not eligible for the zero tax concession and existing companies, including MICs, cannot qualify as PDFs. All of these limit the ability of PDFs to raise money themselves. The bill does nothing to address any of these problems, which clearly will require more attention in the future. On the whole, however, the various changes to PDF restrictions are at least moving in the right direction. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the industry and a couple of academics to whom I spoke agree that the PDF scheme, like the MIC scheme before it, was in some way designed to fail. Treasury sees such schemes as distortive. The scuttlebutt is that if Mr Bill Kelty had not stuck his oar in we would not have even got these changes to the PDF scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There really has not been any serious analysis of the market failure in the venture capital market. Treasury and the bureaucracy are just too neo-classical to take these issues on board. Even a more concessional rate probably is not addressing the root of the problem. It is amelioration of the downside risk which is more critical and this is why the idea of a venture capital fund where the government goes in on some sort of a dollar for dollar equity basis is certainly essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are biases in the system against venture and development capital. We know those. People are reluctant to invest in new ventures so the so-called efficient allocation of resources argument against support for venture and development capital simply does not hold water. Dividend imputation makes investment in companies which can return an immediate franked dividend much more attractive. They also tend to be blue chip companies of course. The biases toward superannuation, tax and compulsion tend to lead towards more blue-chip investment as well. The failure of the capital gains tax to distinguish between short-term speculative investment and long-term strategic investment is another problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan and Germany, among many others, require their superannuation funds to invest a percentage of their funds in venture and development capital. Despite the concerns expressed by our own super funds, which effectively scared the government off such an approach in the white paper lead-up, such schemes have not caused any major stress to retirees and prospective retirees in those countries and have not reduced the pensions that they draw on. Indeed, analysis would probably show that better returns on venture capital would probably lead to an improvement in funds' performance in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there is a market failure in the venture and development capital, a further question must be asked. Why is the government planning to sell the Australian Industry Development Corporation, getting a return which is not commensurate with its value and withdrawing yet another institution that could provide venture capital resources to Australian industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To repeat, PDFs primarily invest in listed securities. They are essentially development capital funds. Greenchip itself admits that with its own limitations on funds, even with the relaxed restrictions, it is not really in a position to support start-up initiatives. The problem in Australia is much less one of a shortage of development capital but more one of a shortage of venture capital. In this regard, examples abound. Only recently we saw a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of how an inventor of a waste treatment process worth billions of dollars is having to go offshore to get financing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Venture capital is the missing link in any plans that we might be developing for the future of Australian industries or for a strategy that enables us with innovative, high quality products, to establish a base in international markets. This bill is not going to achieve that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the coalition to support my colleague Senator Short. As he pointed out, we are not opposing this bill, which makes minor changes to the PDF scheme. I will not take much time of the Senate, but I would like to point out a couple of key things about this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this bill is changing the structure and broadening the size of the company that can be invested in and the proportion of funds that can be put into companies, which is fine, the fundamental thing is that it is really a tax incentive scheme. Even though the government has given notice that its tax incentive will be improved in legislation that is still to come through the chamber by reducing the tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, I make the point to the Senate that that still will not be very attractive to the main source of likely funds in the Australian industry&mdash;that is, the superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential reason is that superannuation funds already enjoy a nominal taxation rate of 15 per cent. In addition, they are able to claim imputation credits from income they derive. So for many superannuation funds there is an effective tax rate of substantially less than 15 per cent&mdash;sometimes as low as nine per cent and more commonly 11 and 12 per cent. Superannuation funds are unlikely to take the route of putting dollars into PDFs at a fixed 15 per cent rate when they can of their own volition invest and suffer an average tax rate of significantly less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that the superannuation funds prefer to invest through trusts where the income goes straight back to the fund and is subject to a lower tax rate, rather than in the PDF company where it must incur the 15 per cent rate. Even though the government has signalled that lower tax rate, we in the coalition do not believe it will work. The whole idea of the scheme was to encourage finance of small and medium sized businesses and, as Senator Spindler said, also venture capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the government has been missing in this scheme is something that has really been under its own control. As the Industry Commission in its report on the availability of capital pointed out, capital is available to match the risk that is associated with the investment, so special schemes are really not required providing there is sufficient capital available. One of the fundamental things that is wrong in the Australian economy and one of the fundamental things that this government has failed to address is the level of savings in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the FitzGerald report of last year pointing out that savings are at a very low level in Australia. Who is the main culprit for the low level of savings? It is in fact the Commonwealth government by running large deficits. In fact, if the government were running in surplus rather than in deficit, we would have a significantly improved savings regime in Australia. That is really what is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if there were a greater savings pool within this nation we would have people more willing to put a proportion of their savings into riskier ventures. That is the fundamental problem with small and medium sized businesses: they are riskier than many other businesses. If there were a larger savings pool then more and more persons, companies, superannuation funds, et cetera, would be willing to devote a proportion of those funds to riskier ventures. As I said before, the level of savings in Australia is at a record low and, as FitzGerald pointed out, the federal government is in fact the main culprit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really is required is a scheme from the government to encourage savings. If we had higher levels of savings there would be savings available to be invested across a whole range of investment opportunities, including risky small and medium sized businesses to which this pooled development fund is aimed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) support the changes to the pooled development funds contained in the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994. In principle, the pooled development funds are an excellent idea. We applaud the principle of supporting small and medium businesses. As the government knows, we put forward a number of ideas along these lines in our budget submission. While we support the pooled development funds in principle and have no problem with reducing taxes on investments and requiring more funds to be invested in small and medium enterprises, we feel that the way the government has set up the pooled development funds leaves much to be desired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I frequently speak on problems in the areas of international trade, workers, the environment and keeping any measure of influence on our economy. Development of a viable economy based on small and medium enterprises owned and controlled locally or within the region represents an answer to many of these problems. It is already well known that most of the employment gains occur through small and medium enterprises. Most people work in small and medium enterprises, and most self-employment is on a fairly small scale. These people live in their communities and so understand that what they do affects their communities. The health of their communities has a direct impact on them. Social interest and personal economic interest most closely coincide. If an enterprise abuses or exploits the community, the community is able to make its views and needs felt. In addition, this is where the famous economies of scope, the flexibility to meet specific needs, take over from economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying necessarily that all small enterprises are good in their labour practices; however, I am suggesting that they can be made to be more responsible for what they do within their local community. This can take the form of finding unique solutions to local problems, using local materials and skills to meet specific needs in innovative ways. As communities are not informationally or economically closed, they have the ability to communicate or market these innovations&mdash;an ability which is often lacking if one must compete on a global basis to gain entry to a market at all. Therefore, the local sphere is properly the ground where innovation which may be applicable more broadly is initially developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to have this happen, there must be a framework where small and possibly innovative enterprises can get access to capital. Ideally, this should be local, since it is a local framework which is needed for proper assessment of the potential of such an enterprise. If we leave it to the big money managers, they will stick with conventional approaches that emphasise safety in all cases and profit maximisation according to rules which see much of the money tied up in land speculation or big business. In many cases, this has meant that development funds, such as superannuation funds, have concentrated investment in a smaller and smaller number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For pooled development funds to work most effectively, they should be under the control of the local community and they should specifically encourage certain types of enterprises, such as those which replace imports to the region. It is ridiculous to have Darwin importing bricks from the Perth area. Clay is not a unique resource. Small businesses such as Broome Bricks have found such a lack of local sourcing that they now supply bricks from Karratha to Darwin. There is no reason why Darwin cannot have its own brickworks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is both environmentally and economically stupid to cart bricks halfway across the continent. Bricks are not light or of high value, and petroleum is an import. It does not make bricks in Darwin cheaper or benefit anyone except the brickmakers of Perth. This is just one example of poor regional development through poor local sourcing. Pooled development funds could be used to support sanity in development and to improve the situation for regions, creating jobs as they diversify the economy. It would also benefit the environment if transport were minimised and the consequences of actions taken for an area were felt within the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this and other amendment bills, the government has shown its willingness to address a number of problems with pooled development funds. We call upon the government to take a broader approach, to transform the pooled development funds into a truly creative tool and to support them to the extent that they have a real impact on regions around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994 will give effect to an announcement in the white paper on 4 May of changes to the pooled development fund scheme, including increasing the tax concessions applying to pooled development fund earnings from their investment in small to medium business enterprises and also modifying certain restrictions on investment in and by pooled development funds. The grave difficulties faced by small to medium sized businesses seeking development finance in Australia are well documented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government sought to address the issue with a pooled development fund program announced in the One Nation statement and commenced on 30 June 1992. The pooled development program was to provide a mechanism for channelling equity capital to small and medium sized businesses. The objective is commendable. But, like so many of the One Nation statement initiatives, the program has failed to live up to expectations and the pooled development funds have failed to attract institutional support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate my colleague Senator Gibson indicated that one of the problems, particularly from the perspective of superannuation funds, concerns the concessional rate that applies to superannuation fund earnings at 15 per cent, which after dividend imputation generally finishes up at about nine per cent. When we look at the Kelty report, we see that the then minister for industry, technology and regional development acknowledged that the program had not worked, with only two of the pooled development funds reaching the point of capital raising. Both had trouble reaching their minimum subscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelty report found that in the private sector the size and nature of the taxation benefit and the restrictions on what pooled development funds can invest in are blamed for the lack of success. Further, it states that private investors and money managers also complain that the taxation benefits offered are not significant and that the benefits are structured so that investors do not receive them until the pooled development funds begin earning money, which sometimes is five years or more after their establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the Senate another reason for this. Maybe the banks, which often are criticised in this area, have fulfilled an obligation in providing finance to a number of small businesses that otherwise perhaps would have sought access to this pooled development market. Maybe the banks have actually been fulfilling a purpose which may not have been recognised or appreciated. Maybe, in between all these other reasons for the lack of success of the pooled development funds, the banks have been lending to certain small businesses. We know that as a result of the recession a number of banks, such as the ANZ, blame the losses of small business during the recession for some of the problems of that bank in Victoria. Maybe we should be giving a bit more credit to some of the banks for lending to small businesses. They have been fulfilling this role. That could well be one of the reasons why the small venture capital market, seeking access to pooled development funds, has also failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, given the complaints about the scheme, I think it is not surprising that only $35 million was raised through the mechanism of pooled development funds. While the bill has now moved to address the tax rate and the restriction on the use of funds&mdash;weaknesses to which I have just referred&mdash;I am still not confident that these changes will be sufficient to make the program any more of a success than its predecessors. The changes to the program are designed to improve the incentive for investing in pooled development funds and the flexibility of operational rules for the pooled development funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incentives that this bill offers include the reduction of the tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits of such funds and their investments in SMEs. While I am not confident of the success of the scheme overall, some of the changes effected by this bill may stimulate further interest in pooled development schemes. That would be good. For example, the raising of the limit to $50 million means that the pooled development regime may open up to companies too small to raise equity capital by means of a public float. In addition, the requirement that pooled development funds invest no more than a total of five per cent of their capital in start-up companies has been abolished. This may encourage pooled developments in sunrise and other high-tech industries. That would also be good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, pooled development funds will now be entitled to invest up to 30 per cent of their capital in a particular investee company, whereas previously it was 20 per cent. Again, this is a move which would make the due diligence costs to pooled development funds prior to investment more efficient. Unfortunately, both the bill and the Working Nation statement do not address any of the central problems of the scheme. I remind the Senate that I raised these problems at the time of the debate when the Pooled Development Funds Bill 1992 was before us on 17 June 1992. At that time, I indicated that the coalition did not believe that the pooled development funds scheme was likely to work. I reflected on the similarities of the scheme to the very similar management investment company scheme which failed in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I remind the Senate what I said in 1992. What is needed to encourage investment of capital in small and medium sized companies is major tax reforms for the business sector and micro-economic reform across the spectrum. This bill is another example of tinkering at the edges of a program that has not met its objectives. The bill does not adopt all of the Kelty report recommendations. The report said that the government should consider a number of changes to the scheme including an up-front incentive for investment in pooled development funds; a reduction in the tax rate, which it has implemented, from 25 per cent to 15 per cent; an exemption from capital gains tax for pooled development funds selling shares in companies in which they have invested; and tax deductibility on losses suffered by investors selling shares in pooled development funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating my lack of confidence in the overall framework of the pooled development scheme. I am disappointed that the government has not picked up all the recommendations that have been offered in the advisory documents. Small and medium sized businesses, I believe, need real measures to get them started. Again, I ask the government to reconsider whether some of the banks have generally committed funds to many of these small ventures. I believe that a lot of the reasons for the major losses from these banks resulted from the failures of small business around Australia. Perhaps they should be given some credit for lending in an area where other people have perhaps been too frightened to move. I thank the Senate. I support the measure. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment to develop a North Australia Social Justice Strategy (NASJS) was announced by the Commonwealth Government in August 1991 as part of its overall approach to addressing locational disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of Northern Development was requested to coordinate the consultation phase to develop the NASJS following the release of the Interim NASJS Report in September 1992. This latter phase has involved gathering input from Government, non-Government and community representatives involved in service delivery, planning and policy development at selected locations throughout North Australia as well as facilitating a Workshop in each State and Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final report focuses on two key elements. One is the perceptions of those involved in direct service delivery, principally at the community level, gained during the consultation and Workshop phases and outlined in Section 3. The issues and strategies identified throughout the consultation phase consistently emphasise the inappropriateness of centrally controlled, urban based service delivery models for many areas throughout northern Australia. They also identify a range of specific issues which need to be considered by individual departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second element is the NASJS Task Force's own considerations based on the results of the consultative process and its overall consideration of impediments to service delivery in northern Australia. Section 4 of the report identifies a number of innovative models and approaches that have emerged in order to overcome various impediments to effective service delivery. These models and approaches are particularly adapted to the unique characteristics of North Australia. The report discusses the current role and future potential of these and addresses the policy implications of bringing a greater impetus to reforms that will assist in improving service delivery across North Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force believes the broader policy changes required by Government to effect improvements in service delivery throughout North Australia should include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a more integrated approach to service delivery across all spheres of government;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a re-assessment of the reliance on per capita based funding formulae;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the achievement of greater efficiencies through simplifying bureaucratic funding structures and programs;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">pooled funding arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the development of more regionally based inter-governmental planning bodies; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the increased development of more innovative models of service delivery appropriate to rural/ remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with such an approach, the Major Recommendations of the NASJS Report are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The development of a North Australia Social Justice Strategy requires a commitment by the three spheres of government to expedite reforms that ensure the provision of more innovative models of service delivery relevant to the needs of people resident in rural and remote areas. These reforms include the achievement of greater efficiencies by:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expanding the availability of relevant cost efficient and innovative service delivery models;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">promoting local compliance with access and equity measures; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">considering the scope for further negotiation of bilateral agreements between the States/Territories and the Commonwealth, specifying consultative, planning, coordination and funding requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.That pilot projects be established in selected regions of northern Australia for the purpose of progressing the development of a whole of government approach to the regional planning and delivery of services. The projects, to be implemented over a three year period, would involve the full participation of already locally established and representative regional organisations. Such organisations would provide the basis for local participation in the planning of service delivery needs across the region. The projects would commence in July 1995. Individual departments and agencies would have the ability to pool existing program funds, within and across identified functions, for planning and allocative purposes, from the commencement of the 1995/96 financial year. Relevant State, Territory and Local Government participation would be negotiated prior to the final establishment of the projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.That the projects be monitored and evaluated by a group including officers seconded from relevant government agencies, and community representatives, and be chaired by a suitably qualified and eminent independent person with a background in regional planning and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.That the Commonwealth Government calls for a cross portfolio submission to cabinet within the Budget context on the means of expediting and implementing the abovementioned recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.That the Commonwealth Government acknowledges the potential inequities that arise in service provision in rural and remote areas from an over reliance on fixed per capita based funding formulae, and agrees that departments will ensure such funding arrangements will in future take into account the increased costs associated with service delivery in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.That the Commonwealth Government reaffirms its commitment to the principles of fiscal equalisation, and recognises the need to ensure that appropriate compensatory arrangements are negotiated with relevant States and Territories, in the event of any substantial dilution of locational factors affecting North Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.The Commonwealth Government notes the issues and strategies raised during the consultations over the NASJS and agrees to refer these to relevant departments and spheres of government for their consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.The Commonwealth Government acknowledges the need to upgrade the quality and availability of social indicator data on North Australia and supports the current submission before the Australia Research Council to establish a Northern Australia Social Research Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.The Commonwealth Government supports the need for departments to exercise the necessary flexibility already available that enables incentives to be adopted that assist in the recruitment and retention of key staff in remote areas. It also agrees that future training of departmental and agency staff in North Australia will include an emphasis on cross-cultural communications, strategic planning, and the gaining of a fuller understanding of the historical and socio-economic profiles of the regions in which they work. Such training should be delivered on a cross-portfolio basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.That the Commonwealth Government investigate the establishment of negotiated minimum service and infrastructure standards for remote locations where current funding or quality control criteria prevent the establishment of required services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is most crucial; it demands our attention urgently. When we turn to the detailed report, look at it and take the time to read it, we see a dichotomy in the way it has been presented. I am going to compliment particular parts of it, some of the authorship and some of the issues that have been canvassed and addressed. My criticism that has to accompany it is the sleight of hand and the cunning process that has been adopted in the manner it has been released and&mdash;from the government's point of view&mdash;hopefully buried as a skeleton document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has only 10 specific recommendations&mdash;if the government would respond to them formally&mdash;seven of which impact on the Commonwealth government; the other three impact on all spheres of government. But when we go to the detail of the report and dig behind it, we see that what it does&mdash;that I can identify&mdash;is address 246 specific issues, most of them in the form of very trenchant criticism; and develops 172 specific strategies for the development of social justice in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is stepping back and saying it will not present it in a formal sense and will not respond to it in that way. Given this government's priority with social justice, I believe that is an insult to people living in north Australia. We have had other social justice statements made to this parliament; and very properly debated and canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also took a very keen interest in this report and the way it has been developed because its genesis goes back to the creation of the Office of Northern Development, in the then Department of the Prime Minister, in  August 1991. There was an interim report in September 1992 which flowed out of that and now, in March 1994, we get this very comprehensive final report, under the title `Final Report', which the government is attempting to camouflage and to hide it from the specific reactions it must get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that there is no acknowledgment of the prior work that was so very important in this issue. There was no mention made of the excellent work for over a decade of the North Australian Development Conference that was brought together with the participation of federal, Queensland, Western Australian and Northern Territory agencies. There were hundreds of people participating at all levels of government, from regional and local government, Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no mention whatsoever of the country task force of the Prime Minister, which preceded this work for a considerable time and which my Northern Territory colleague Mr Snowdon chaired for a number of years. There was no mention of its previous reports. There was no mention of the special north Australian development unit that was created within the then Department of Social Security prior to the Office of Northern Development; or of all of the fine work, papers and reports it presented on issues that needed to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I take offence because there were a number of documents that I prepared as shadow minister in 1990 that addressed the same issues. One was `Resource Development&mdash;Northern Australia, a summary of mineral and energy issues, committed projects, potential developments identified and areas of prospectivity'. Another one I prepared in 1990 was `Road, rail and sea transport issues&mdash;northern Australia'. I prepared another: `Export potential&mdash;northern Australia&mdash;a summary of primary and resource industries, tourism, horticulture, manufactured products and education/technology services'. There was another called `Social security/welfare issues, a summary of research undertaken by the North Australian Development Unit of the Department of Social Security'. I did another entitled `Poverty in northern Australia, a comprehensive study of the issues and statistics relating to social disadvantage in remote area towns/cities and Aboriginal communities'. I table these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made all that information available very early in the piece to the authors of this report. There is no mention of it whatsoever. I suppose that is not surprising, given the riding instructions they must have received from a Labor government. When we look at the fine work of the Northern Territory University, the Australian National University (North Australian Research Unit) and the James Cook University in North Queensland&mdash;all of it very specific work&mdash;we find scant regard for any of the work that was put together. We have only to look at the issues that flowed from the community discussions that were coordinated by this project across northern Australia and look specifically at the 246 issues and the 172 strategies to see why the government is now attempting to hide and camouflage this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 3 of the report breaks into a number of subsections. One is `Service issues and strategies', which covered housing, health, education, training, transport and communications, information and technology, law and order and local government. Some 152 issues were addressed and 111 strategies developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On all the issues relating to women, child care, youth, aged people with disabilities, ethnic people, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people there were 55 issues and 32 strategies and, surprisingly, only 18 issues and 9 strategies relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broad policy issue area, 41 issues and 29 strategies were put forward. What do we find at the end of the day? This is all drawn into a tight 10 recommendations, three in general terms and seven specific to the Commonwealth. Of course, if the government responded to them, we would end up with a series of pious words&mdash;and no action whatsoever. Let me put the government on notice: I am going to test out, through estimates committees and through debates in this place over the next six or 12 months, every one of the 248 issues and 172 strategies. This Labor government had better live up to the words of what it says is important in its `North Australia social justice strategy', because the crafting and authorship of this report&mdash;when we get behind the front pages&mdash;are quite an incredible indictment of a decade of neglect by Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is a blow to Labor's `we know best' attitude. The report goes on to suggest very broad policy changes, a more integrated approach to service delivery, a re-assessment of the reliance on per capita based funding formulae, simplifying bureaucratic funding structures and programs, pooled funding arrangements, the development of more regionally based inter-government planning bodies and more innovative models of service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to go to the specifics of this report; whether on issues relating to Aboriginal health, population change, Aboriginal CDEP, housing, health, education, employment, communications, training, transport and communications, information and technology, local government, or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander specifics, and look at the pages and pages of criticisms that the government is now trying to hide. It is no wonder that Mr Howe was not game to table this document in the parliament. I have now tabled it tonight: I want the Senate to address it; I want the House of Representatives to address it; I want the government to address every one of those 248 issues and 172 strategies that its own working party has put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also look very carefully at the working party that was put together. Its members are listed on page 127 of the report. There were 22 people from various government departments&mdash;no outside help, no bringing in a wider area. These people obviously crafted the report. These were 22 people from the bureaucracy and the public service representing north Australia. There was not one Aborigine. This is a Labor government, imbued with social justice&mdash;the entire report is focused on that&mdash;and there is not one person listed in that 22 person task force who was an Aborigine or drawn from that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am insulted on behalf of the people from the Northern Territory. This is a report that the government must address. I hope every journalist in the gallery gets a copy of it and goes through it. There will be article after article to be used in Sunday specials for the next six months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on record a matter that I have been pursuing for some two years through estimates and through questions on notice. The reason I put it on record is that I want to show the lengths that this government and the bureaucracy will go to to try to hide the truth; and try to hide the huge amount of taxpayers' money that has been expended on the law enforcement access network. I have to go back to 1 April 1992&mdash;April Fools' Day 1992&mdash;when I asked a question of the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate. I remember it very well. The question I asked at question time was regarding a press release from the world-wide privacy body, Privacy International, which raised concerns about privacy in relation to this law enforcement access network that was proposed to be set up in Australia. There were queries and questions raised by our Privacy Commissioner, Kevin O'Connor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the question, the first thing Senator Tate said was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition appears to be trying to hop on an hysterical bandwagon so far as this project is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Two years later this `hysterical bandwagon' has come home to roost. The fact is that cabinet decided a week or so ago to step back and walk away from this particular project, leaving the taxpayers of Australia over $3 million worse off. It is a disgrace!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are any victories in it, there is a victory for the Senate and its estimates committees. Honourable senators have the opportunity to ask questions even though bureaucrats are under instructions from their ministers and they try to hide the answers. If one is tenacious enough to ask questions over a long enough period of time, eventually one may get a bit of success and expose the waste and bad management that are going on in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This LEAN project, which turned out to be rather a fat one as far as wasting money was concerned, was set up and&mdash;Senator Panizza would remember this&mdash;a lot of concerns were raised about it at the time. This project involved the establishment of a central computer facility here in Canberra to keep a record of all land ownership and company records right across Australia. The idea was to get behind the corporate veil by using sophisticated analytical capabilities to check on contractors for fraud, to check client statements quickly and cheaply against a national database, to trace assets and, in particular, to ensure compliance with capital gains tax. That was the reason behind it and it was the result of a white paper handed down in 1987 on a review of systems dealing with fraud in the Commonwealth. Obviously, the ideas and intentions were good but that is where it finished. It has been an absolute disgrace from start to finish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said it would implement LEAN because it believed that it had a responsibility to protect the community from those who break the law and attempt to rip off taxpayers through welfare cheating, tax evasion and other fraudulent means. Those were very fine ideals but, in practice, the project has been an absolute disaster. The timetable was that the project started in 1991 and was scheduled to commence at the end of 1992. Of course, that did not happen. After raising the first question about it here, I followed it up the next day on 2 April 1992 with questions at the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not seem all that long ago but I can assure Senator Panizza this was two years ago. I remember very well quizzing the head of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Reaburn, who, rather reluctantly, did make some admissions. Mr Roberts, actually, from the department said it was a very good fraud control technique. I raised questions about this, and I think some of the Australian Democrats had concerns about the privacy aspects. Some of the more flamboyant remarks by opposition members at the time were that this would be another Australia card operation. The Australian Taxation Office was looking at connecting some 6,000 terminals to this computer giant and the Taxation Office was to be one of the major users of the facility. By the time the opposition had finished raising questions, the number of terminals had reached 10,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on to ask more questions. If I remember correctly, at the time the Privacy Commissioner was on record as saying that LEAN was: `A doomsday book of all the assets of all Australians.' He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that LEAN carries implications which are deserving of wider discussion than has occurred to date.</PARA>
<PARA>The government was very secretive about this whole matter. No matter how many questions I asked, it was like drawing teeth&mdash;the government would not come forward with any answers. The government stonewalled, and this was in September 1992. Every time I asked questions in estimates, the government was very reluctant to answer questions. The government did admit that it had engaged a company, not an Australian company, but an overseas company called Admiral Computing, which received $242,000 to act as consultants. The reason the government gave was that it thought that if it used any computer experts from Australia there may have been a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised the matter at the time, Admiral Computing walked away with $242,000 for a very short engagement. I remember at the time, in September, Senator Vanstone asking questions and quoting from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that it worked out that three people were involved in this selective tender awarded to Admiral Computing and they received about $2,500 a day. Having said that and flagged the fact that it was likely to be a large waste of money, the opposition started querying the government on when it could let us know when it would let the tenders for the particular computer system. On 10 September 1992, Senator Vanstone asked Mr Reaburn whether the tender would be let `this year' and he replied, `Yes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are in 1994 and the matter has just been cleaned up. I asked again on 11 May 1993. Again, the government stonewalled. Senator Bolkus was the minister and I asked questions, saying that I understood the sensitivity of the matter, that tenders were being called and the like. Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>

<PARA>The answer was yes. My question continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the recommendations of that report was that the need for the LEAN facility be reviewed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I asked about the outcomes of the analysis and what would happen and was told that cabinet had decided that the development of LEAN should cease. There were no answers or reasons except:</PARA>
