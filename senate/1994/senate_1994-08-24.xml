<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for an increase in the funds appropriated under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1988 to support tertiary education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. The funds concerned are to be transferred from the Higher Education Funding Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funds concerned will be made available under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program. This program was introduced in 1990 and underpins the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP). Funding for this program is presently appropriated on a triennial basis with the second triennium covering the years 1993 to 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth remains committed to the AEP which addresses the inequality of educational opportunities and outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1993 the Commonwealth government, with the agreement of all State and Territory governments, commenced a National Review of Education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People. The National Review has been asked to examine whether or not the strategies developed over the first three years of the AEP have been effective and to suggest some new strategic directions where these might be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A National Reference Group to oversee the Review was appointed in October 1993. The ten members of the Reference Group, chaired by Mandawuy Yunupingu, issued a Discussion Paper in February 1994. The second stage of the Review, which will take account of the views put forward in submissions and in the responses to the Discussion Paper, will culminate in a final report and recommendations to be presented in September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this National Review, the April 1994 meeting  of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, considered a discussion paper presented by the Commonwealth in relation to developing a national strategy for the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Council agreed to establish a group to provide advice to Ministers within three months on the terms of reference, membership, term and financial arrangements for the development of a national strategy. Following acceptance of the terms of reference by Ministers, a national strategy working party, chaired by the Commonwealth, will be established. The working party will provide a progress report for consideration by the Ministerial Council at its October/November 1994 meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth looks forward to responding positively to both the recommendations of the National Review and the report of the national strategy working party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for a small increase in Commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program for 1995 and 1996 to support tertiary education provision in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the appropriation of $84.131 million in 1995 and $256,000 in 1996. The 1995 funding level represents an increase of $212,000 on the amount currently specified in the Principal Act. The amount appropriated for 1996 reflects the amount of funds to be transferred from the Higher Education Funding Act. Legislation will be introduced at a later stage to increase that amount to reflect the appropriate base level of funding which should apply in 1986 and later years.</PARA>

<PARA>I say at the outset that these are proposals of the Procedure Committee. There is no government ownership in any of this, but just for the procedural convenience of the chamber it is usually the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) who presides. But, as he is watching Australia win gold medals, it has fallen to me to move these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose these reforms arose out of the view of the opposition&mdash;I think shared by the minority parties in the Senate&mdash;that it would like to see a change in the Senate committee system, especially that the chairs of committees would more accurately represent the numbers in the chamber. I am not sure of the reason for this&mdash;whether it is philosophically based or otherwise. If it is philosophically based, it is purely quarantined to the national parliament. Where the Liberal Party has a majority anywhere else in Australia this sort of bonhomie has not emerged. Nevertheless, it has to be said that often the federal parliament leads and the states follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I might make some general comments. Even if I may be somewhat dubious about all the motives involved here, one of the good things about bringing in some reforms in the Senate is that more often than not a lot of good things emerge out of it. I hope that the combination of reference and legislation committees, and the concentration of resources there, will very much enhance the Senate committee system. Even if we carry this today, we have some remaining problems to resolve, but certainly we would be seeking that the remuneration tribunal establish a regime that is fair. One would hope that this parliament's select committees would be somewhat restricted. The difficulty of government numbers bottling up a reference in a standing committee is one of the reasons why select committees have emerged. That need no longer occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say one other thing. This probably is not the perfect system because it involves compromise; it involves some sort of compact between the opposition and the government where we say, `Is there enough turkey on each other's plate to make this place work?' Hence, some of the changes are really based on that compromise. I have no doubt that some amendments will emerge today. I am hopeful that those amendments will not amount to a substantive or dramatic change from what was thrashed out and agreed at the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the proposals in standing order 25 lists the eight committees. It basically says that there will be a government chair and majority on the legislation side to deal with legislation, estimates and annual reports. On the reference committees there will be a non-government majority and a non-government chair, with the sharing of chairs between the opposition and the Democrats. There are procedures in place basically saying that the opposition will take six and the Democrats or minor parties will take two. If it cannot be sorted out, it will come back to this chamber to be sorted out. In one instance I guess the government is fairly empowered with its numbers to make a decision. I do not think I need say much more; the matter has been fairly well canvassed. I think we will see some very interesting changes come out of this particular proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could make a few general comments in response to the minister's motion which, of course, arises out of the recommendations of the Procedure Committee, which is a committee comprising representatives of all major parties in this place. The committee system of the Senate is vitally important to its effective operation. In many ways the committee system is what distinguishes the legislative function of this place from that of the House of Representatives. There is no doubt that the community expects of a house of review, and in particular the Australian Senate, an extra responsibility in relation to both the scrutiny of the government's legislative program and the scrutiny of the government's appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, one can say that those responsibilities have been well accepted by this chamber. In fact, in some areas of scrutiny the Australian Senate is regarded by academics as having led the world. I think this is so particularly in relation to the scrutiny of subordinate legislation through the setting up of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and then later, in relation to certain aspects of the legislative process to protect civil rights, in particular, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the appropriations, I think it is also generally accepted that the Senate estimates committee system has fulfilled a useful function. It is really the parliament's only opportunity to examine, in effect line by line, the government's appropriations through each of the departments. Senators have the opportunity not only to question the minister responsible for that department or, in some instances, the minister representing the minister responsible for that department in this place, but also to question the relevant departmental officers. That is an important function, and the mechanism is in place whereby it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had many debates as to whether the estimates process might be improved. Not surprisingly, some government ministers have found it a frustrating process. There will always be some who believe that the concentration has been on the wrong issues of the day. Nevertheless, what is important is that the facility is there. We can all point to many instances where it has worked most effectively, as a result of which the accountability of the government in financial matters has been effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effectiveness of the legislative scrutiny, however, is more open to debate. The functions of the Senate in that regard, one might say, have really been divided into two roles: on the one hand, to scrutinise legislation through the committee system as a more in-depth examination than simply a debate at the committee stage in this place; and also to take references, I guess, from a more policy oriented, public interest stance, on issues that are important to the community and to explore, with the opportunity of community input, whether or not this Senate should, in effect, advise that certain policy responses should follow from government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these references into matters of public interest, I think the record of the Senate is good. Certainly it is not an inexpensive process. But in matters of national interest it does give, as I said, the community an opportunity to participate and have their views put on the public record. That extension of democracy, I think, is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the scrutiny of the government's legislative program, however, I think there is reason for debate as to whether that has been most effectively done through this committee system. As you will be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Senate amended the mechanisms to enable that scrutiny of legislation to provide for short term inquiries, what we referred to as `the Friday inquiries', to provide a greater level of scrutiny than would occur in this chamber but to do it in a way that is reasonably restrained, both financially and from a time point of view, and, therefore, not unduly disruptive to the government's program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly supported that reform, because I do not think in many ways the committee stage debate in this place works well. It is a strained debate, with ministers more often than not needing to seek advice from officials as the debate progresses. There is no direct opportunity to question those officials. There is no opportunity for any outside input into the debate, for any specialist input or input from interest groups. It always struck me that some mechanism&mdash;albeit in a reasonably efficient way that could overcome those shortcomings of the committee stage debate in this place&mdash;would be a reform that was in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a short time that Friday committee mechanism, I thought, worked reasonably well. Certainly there were difficulties, particularly in relation to often the very short time available for advising potential witnesses of inquiries&mdash;in other words, bringing them to public attention. There were arguments about who the appropriate witnesses to call were in an inquiry that was clearly going to be very limited in time. Nevertheless, I think it improved the legislative process&mdash;I can point to examples if I have to&mdash;and therefore the Senate was doing its job better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that reform was introduced, a normal sitting day of the Senate was set aside for the Senate to break into those legislative and general purpose committees to examine bills in that way. That in effect became for a short time the way in with the Senate functioned on that day. In a normal sitting week of four days, the Senate sat in the chamber on three days and on one day in the various legislative committees, which sat elsewhere in this building and carried out their business in that distinctive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with the change in sitting times of this place, which was basically against our position, at least one week in every two sitting weeks was extended to four days. Not surprisingly, there was resistance from senators, who, as we all know, have pressures back in their electorates and so need to spend at least one day a week serving their constituents rather than being here. The capacity to serve those committees in the way that was originally envisaged started to be lost. It is my observation that that Friday committee system has now very much broken down. That is disappointing because, as I have just argued, I think it was a very useful reform in the legislative process of this nation and that capacity has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms that have been put before the chamber today will not totally resolve that. Nevertheless, drawing together what was the estimates committee system with what I have described as the Friday examination of bills system may well lead to committees that are stronger, that have more of a continuity, and that perhaps will encourage senators towards having greater specialisation, which is something that I have also always argued for. Although it is difficult to specialise because everyone in this place wants to be an expert on everything, I have always thought the Senate as a whole would be strengthened if senators specialised more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that starts to flow from the amalgamation of the estimates committees with the Friday committee system, I think the process of accountability in relation to legislation might again be strengthened. But until adequate time is protected within the system for the meetings of those committees, I fear that they will still never do the job as well as I would like them to. That is a part of this restructuring that is worth a try. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part will involve what is left; that is, the function of the committees to examine longer term references in the public interest. What will change is that, basically, those committees will be chaired by non-government senators. There can be varied opinions about that issue as well, but I tend to think that that will add a new driving influence to those committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our experiences is that the committee does better when chairmen are introduced who have a vested interest in ensuring that the committee does well. The new opportunities that will come out of the restructuring&mdash;for example, backbench senators taking a lead in the development of public policy&mdash;will, I am confident, result in an even better performance from the committees in that important function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that it has been a practice for some time that government senators should control these committees. Senator Ray mused as to why we would want to see change in that regard. These committees, particularly in this area, are not committees of the government; they are committees of the Senate. There is no logical reason why they should not reflect the numbers in the Senate, rather than who might hold the numbers in the other place. It is not an unusual practice. I hesitate to go back as far as Westminster, but I understand that there are not the same constraints of practice there that there have been in this place. I suspect that the practice in this place arose at a time when the government of the day controlled the numbers in this place.</PARA>

What we are really interested in today is looking to the ongoing responsibility of the Senate as a chamber to maximise its capability of having the best quality accountability.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have broken from that practice in recent times in relation to select committees, with opposition senators chairing them. There have been some examples to demonstrate how well that can make the system work. I use the example of Senator Watson's chairing of the superannuation select committee. I think that all in this chamber would agree that his leadership of that committee has enhanced it and that that committee has done a great deal of very worthwhile work in the public interest under that leadership. </PARA>

There will always be that political argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate committee system as it now stands is, as we all know, somewhat uncoordinated. It is essentially a product of a completely different Senate of the 1970s. When I proposed this reference to the Senate, the idea behind it was to update the committee system to respond to the 1990s. I believe that to a large extent that is what the Procedure Committee has done in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wanted a system of coordinated committees with expertise in different areas. So we would have two different committees&mdash;one in the legislative area and one in the policy or reference area&mdash;that could be used by committee members, and by the staff as well, to better effect than they are at the moment in studying policy areas, in studying legislation and in studying estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also taken the estimates committees out of the framework that they are in at the moment and have put them into our overall framework. The people on the legislative committees looking at the estimates will have far more expertise. This should make the system more efficient. There should be a shorter time frame for looking at estimates and the result should be something that is more of interest to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reforms the Democrats in particular wanted to get up&mdash;I believe the Independents and the Greens also wanted this&mdash;is the inclusion of participating members on committees. Under such a proposal, any senator would be able to go to any committee for the duration of any reference. Senators would be able to go to the hearings on that reference and question witnesses. They would be able to go to the private meetings on that reference, and would then be able to have a lot of input into the report of that committee. So we would be able either to be a part of the majority report or, if we felt it incumbent upon us, write our own minority reports and have them considered when the Senate considers the report. I think that is a very important reform. I think it is one that is going to make representation on these committees a lot more even. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Robert Ray congratulated the Senate on the coordination between the government and the opposition.

But I point out that this was in fact a Democrat reference and that the main proposals discussed in the Procedure Committee were Democrat proposals. The Democrats did have a lot to do with this. We were considered and we were a part of the whole process. I congratulate the government and the opposition on their agreement; I congratulate the Democrats on our agreement; and I congratulate the Independents and the Greens on their agreement. Everybody in the Senate was involved in this report. One of the best things about this report is that everybody was involved and everybody has agreed in the end on what it should be. </PARA>

It will still not be perfect in about a year, but I hope we will be able to look at it in six months or 12 months and, if there are glaring changes that have to be made, we will know by then what they are and will be able to make them. Putting it into standing orders now is a sensible move. It is just as easy to change standing orders when we know what the difference is and what we have to change. I am looking forward to having a completely new, very coordinated and, I hope, much more streamlined committee system. It will be different because the government has given up many things. The opposition has given up a couple of things. We have all gained things out of this too, though. Every one of us will gain something out of this new committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the chair of committees is very interesting. There is an argument that the government of the day needs the chair of the legislative system of committees because there is an opportunity for manipulation.

It is something I brought up in the Procedure Committee that I would like to see as part of the system: any participating member would have to go to a certain number of the hearings and the private meetings to be included in the final stage. I do not think this would happen, but there is the possibility under this system for somebody to turn up to the last meeting and to be included in the writing of the report, not having heard witnesses, not having questioned witnesses and not having the same background as everybody else. I do not think that is particularly fair. I hope we all keep in mind that, if we include ourselves in a reference, we do it seriously.

When I put in our first proposals, one senator said to me, `This is a very radical change and therefore we are not sure if we like it very much.' It is a bit of a radical change, but it is not terribly different to what we do now. It will improve and streamline the committee system as we have it. I am looking forward to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the concepts in this structure are a little similar to some of the ideas in the 1989 report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I am referring particularly to having the responsibility for the performance of departments and agencies over the longer term linked to an examination of the estimates process. I have thought for a long time that that biannual blockbuster operation of all-night sittings and the pressure, both on the committees and on the Public Service, was not the best way of operating. Some parts of the performance accountability area need not be squashed into those couple of nights twice a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have got out of this Procedure Committee reference is not so much a collapsing of the estimates and performance examination processes with the general committee structure but a double stream system whereby we have references committees to deal with issues&mdash;I would suspect that most of these would be over a longer term; they would not usually be very rapid references&mdash;and, on the other hand, the stream of legislation committees. These would look at bills, including the appropriation bills, that is, the estimates process, and would have the continuous responsibility, as clause 2(b) of the proposed standing orders says, of `Annual reports in accordance with the reference of such reports to them and the performance of departments and agencies allocated to them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of that extra function beyond bills and estimates that I kept wanting to come up with a better name than just legislation committees for this stream of committees because it is a narrower title than is the reality of the functions of these committees. However, I have to accept that the various suggestions that I came up with, such as performance and legislation committees, were not accepted by other people on the Procedure Committee who wanted, above all, a one-word name for these committees. So I have to accept that we have references committees on the one hand and legislation committees on the other; but all I would ask is that senators remember that the function of the legislation committees is not only bills and estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggested performance and legislation committees; but I do not want to start moving amendments and upsetting the agreement. All I want to do is emphasise that, even though they have this name, they have the broader function. The Senate will recall that several years ago the responsibility for annual reports was beefed up in relation to the responsibilities of committees. This again arose out of a recommendation of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration but it was taken up by former Senator Hamer in moving a motion to ensure a regularised method of referring annual reports to committees. This set of proposals incorporates that system into the responsibility of the legislation committees and suitably simplifies it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference of annual reports has had a mixed response from committees. I suspect most committees and their staffs have seen it as a bit of a chore&mdash;something that has to be done twice a year when there are so many other things to be considered. I hope that the specific responsibility for annual reports being given to the legislation committees will see that task given a little more importance, especially with the way in which under the new budget system the annual reports will effectively be the agenda for the additional estimates meetings of legislation committees in, I think, November. So I suspect that with departments and budget dependent agencies the examination of annual reports will be done in relation to the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always the opportunity at other times of the year for committees to review annual reports of departments and agencies in a calm and considered way and not have to do it only at the time of estimates hearings. One of the negatives in the past about the estimates process has been the pressure on government members not to participate any more than they feel they have to in the questioning of departments and budget dependent agencies at estimates hearings because of the pressure of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received criticism from the opposition that government senators do not take the estimates seriously. I think there ought to be an opportunity for us to take them more seriously and for us to focus not only on some of the negatives that are raised by government senators but also on good performance by departments and agencies which should be brought to the attention of estimates committees and other hearings of the legislation committees at other times of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would help in the relationship between the parliament and the Public Service if just occasionally, instead of public servants being brought before committees only when there is some administrative foul-up, they were brought in for a pat on the back&mdash;that is, for a committee to decide to examine a particular section of a department's performance as an ongoing review of that department and to provide the opportunity for an example of good performance to be brought to attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know time is always a problem in these matters and, therefore, priority is given to concentrating on the negatives and reviewing the occasional foul-up that does occur in administration, but I ask committees to keep in mind the opportunity for ongoing monitoring of the performance of departments and other agencies and for that to be done by the legislation committees in their distinctly different tasks from those of the references committees, which have the responsibility of looking at issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support Senator Bourne in her drawing attention to the possibility of having participating members of both streams of committees. The concept for this came out of the knots that the opposition tended to get itself tied in by substituting people for particular departments at estimates because there were a lot more opposition members available to serve on committees than there were positions. The introduction of the term `participating member' allows for all senators, but particularly opposition senators and those from the minority parties, to almost self-nominate to be a participant in a committee because they are interested in that subject and not just because they are needed to be one of their party's numbers in the prescribed full membership of the various committees. There is no reason why government senators might not occasionally take advantage of this opportunity as well, but I do recognise that it is more likely to occur in relation to non-government senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Panizza had listened to me a moment ago, he would have heard me explaining one of the reasons why the pressure is on government senators to get the process over with and not to participate as much as they might like to on some occasions. I suggest that this is a benefit to most people in the chamber. It might reduce the pressure to be elected a member of a committee if there is the opportunity, for a particular inquiry or a particular part of a legislation committee's function, to have participating membership, which can be listed with the formal listing of a committee. For those who want recognition back in their states that they have a relevance to a particular inquiry, it can be recorded that they are a participating member and not just a visitor to a particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to clause 8 of this proposed standing order about the appointment of subcommittees, which once again has not been used as much in the past as it might have been. What this allows is also relevant to the participating member concept; that is, there might be a subcommittee of a committee of the bare three members as prescribed here but on which there might be two, three or four participating members as well because that is their particular interest. There is no need to change the membership of the committee in order to allow for their involvement. The formal subcommittee is there for the formal process but there can be quite a large number of participating members if that is what senators want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing about emphasising this subcommittee operation and the relevance of participating members is that that should reduce the need for so many select committees to be appointed. We have had ideas for select committees partly because of those proposing them wanting to have the chair of them and to have the main carriage of the process. Now that it is proposed that the chairing be shared and that there be emphasis on subcommittees and participating members, the need for there to be a separate select committee should be reduced. I think every time there is a suggestion that a particular issue be referred to a select committee, the proposer should think carefully. If there is a specific committee of the Senate already in existence with the responsibility for that portfolio, and if there is someone with a particular interest in it who can be added to that committee as a participating member, that process should be followed, rather than clogging up the system with yet another select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final matter is the question of the secretariats. The proposal is that the secretariats, as they currently stand, jointly service both the references and legislation streams of committees so that the expertise that exists in those committees can be fully used. Some members of those secretariats are particularly keen on, and expert in, administration, in making sure that things work smoothly and liaising with departments, such as in the estimates process. If it is their wish to specialise in that area, they can do so and be of more service to the legislation stream than to the references stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others are more suited to research and writing. They would tend to specialise more in the references committee of that area. As well, it allows for a variety of work for those who should be given experience in both areas. I hope that the proposed system is welcomed by the various committee secretariats. I suspect that it should be easier for the Senate administration overall in not having so much to re-shuffle resources amongst committees as workloads vary because the workload of the combined references and legislation committee of each set of portfolios should be of a similar order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, has moved a very important motion, one which translates the recommendations of the Senate Procedure Committee and takes on board all the advice of the Clerk of the Senate in terms of the vocabulary required by the standing orders.

Indeed, it is an enhancement of the effectiveness of the Senate and the parliament of Australia. Certainly, this will not mean any diminution, any taking away of powers, of the estimates committees, the legislation committees&mdash;sometimes referred to as Friday committees&mdash;or references committees, the national inquiries that have been so effective over the last 25 years, carried out by seven, sometimes eight, standing committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will not diminish the review by committees of annual reports. It will not diminish the scrutiny committees or, indeed, the house committees of the Senate. The motion that is before us provides a strengthening and maturing of the Senate committee system in all of these respects that we have come to know over the last 25 years. Not all parliaments in the world have a committee system. Some parliaments operate in such a way that all of their business is transacted by the chamber as a whole. But it is a more sophisticated and much more effective way for a parliament to operate when even up to half of its business is conducted by small sections of the members of the chamber as a whole. We call those small sections committees. So the development of a committee system whereby many activities can be undertaken at the same time, where the committees are given their work by the chamber as a whole and where the committees report back to the chamber as a whole is a sophisticated way for a parliament to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian parliament has, I believe, an unsurpassed committee system. In terms of the two chambers, the Senate has the most developed committee system of all. What we are doing by proposing this motion today, which I hope will be passed today&mdash;and I will curtail my general remarks to that end&mdash;is to make it very clear that this Senate is in the business of being at the front edge of effective parliaments in the world and of ensuring that we are refining a very, very good instrument that has been developed in the last 25 years. In referring to the last 25 years, let me quote from the authoritative book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> that was written by Mr Odgers. I quote from page 728:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new era in Australian parliamentary history began in 1970 with the introduction of a wide-ranging system of Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees and Estimates Committees.</PARA>
<PARA>They did not exist before 1970. I draw attention to the sixth provision of the first standing orders that were adopted at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each Standing Committee shall elect a Government member as Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA>What we are moving on from is an endorsement of the legislative and general purpose standing committees and estimates committees that were established 25 years ago and modifying that provision which stated that each committee was to be chaired by a government member. At the time when this was introduced my party happened to be in the majority in the Senate. It was during the Menzies era and its successors, when the Liberal and National parties were in the majority for most of that time, not only in the House of Representatives but in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument for specialisation, for enhancing the work of parliament through committees, was proposed from all sides&mdash;by the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party and the independent party at that time, the Democratic Labor Party. But when they came to set up a powerful committee system, it was obviously understood by government members&mdash;my colleagues in the Liberal and National party&mdash;that whereas in the chamber there was a majority of government members at any time, these committees might do critical work that would provide a block or cause some damage or delay to government legislation and government decisions. Therefore, the Liberal and National party majority only agreed to the creation of this committee system if it were controlled at every point by a government member. Whatever the numbers were in the Senate in the future, there was an undertaking that the government of the day would have control. Therefore, all committees were to be chaired by government members and the government member chairman would have a casting vote in any decision. So in any crunch situation the government would always have a majority and would therefore have control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are moving to now is the kind of maturity which Australia is ready for, whereby the control of the Senate committee system is by the Senate itself, but where the chairmanship of particular committees is in the hands of senators in a manner which is directly proportional to the composition of the Senate as elected by the Australian people. No longer will there be a predominance of government members. Accordingly, out of the 40 committees that have existed to this time, there will be a distribution of chairmanships as nearly as possible proportional to the numbers of government, opposition, independent and minority party senators. That is one of the major steps forward in sophistication and maturity that we are now putting in place through the motion moved by Senator Ray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senate committees achieve the least if there is confrontation, if there is a use of numbers to determine either the procedure or outcome of a committee report. Those committees that work best&mdash;and that is the great majority of committees&mdash;are those which have recourse to the merit of the argument, where there is a genuine, mature acceptance of bipartisanship, where there is agreement that we are all working for the benefit of the Australian people; whether we are Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat or Independent, we are listening to the submissions of the people of Australia and properly reflecting findings and recommendations that we bring to this chamber in a representative way, on the merits of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this sense of responsibility which will continue to enhance the committee system, whether a particular committee is chaired by a government member, an opposition member or an independent party member. It is because of our sense of being the representatives of the Senate as a whole that we will see the Senate committee system working at its best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to one other element of the beginnings of the committee system in 1969-70, when Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson was Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Lionel Murphy was Leader of the Opposition and Senator Gair was the leader of the independent party at the time, the Democratic Labor Party. The Clerk of the Senate at the time, Mr Odgers, was asked by the Senate to bring in a full report on how a Senate committee system should be set up and to take into account the experiences of other countries, such as the UK and Canada. The Odgers report is discussed on pages 734 and 735 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. I do not have time to go into the detail of that, but I bring to bear all of the history of these last 25 years when we take this next historic step to positively improve the Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Procedure Committee of this chamber worked effectively together.

There was an agreement on the principle that is embodied in this motion. Some careful work was done by a smaller group that included Senator Robert Ray, Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Bourne.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note the changes particularly to the legislation committees. The functions of those committees are really functions of the Senate as a whole&mdash;for example, on estimates committees. The debate in the committee of the whole is now assisted by the work of the estimates committees. Those estimates committees examine the estimates which are proposed by the various government departments for the purposes of the legislation currently before us. That aspect of the legislation committee, of course, assists the functions of the Senate committee of the whole. Again, the function of the consideration of any bills, including draft bills, to be referred to the legislation committees is also a function of the Senate as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, it is desirable to ensure that individual senators are able to attend and participate in the operation of those particular committees. The way that this motion is drawn up, however, says that participating members may be appointed to the committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few brief remarks on the report of the Procedure Committee. Senator Harradine asked about senators who wish to participate in the new committee structure. The general intention of the changes, as I understand it&mdash;and I believe it has been well fulfilled&mdash;is to make it easier for senators to take part. As a result, we have the changing nature of quorums and the ability of the committees to sit while the Senate is sitting. A number of changes make it easier for senators to take part in the hearings of the committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to pre-empt anything that Senator Bourne might say, but I think she was referring to the desire to avoid the capricious dissenting report by someone who has not bothered to attend any of the hearings, or who has just flashed in and flashed out, but nonetheless wants to big-note himself or herself by appending a dissenting report to an otherwise unanimous report of the committee. It would be a matter of great concern if that happened. A fair reading of the changes shows that it will be easier for senators to take part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fundamental reform of the Senate committee system. I suspect that it is arguably the most far-reaching reform that has taken place since the system was originally established some quarter of a century ago. There is a need for further changes in the system. For a variety of reasons&mdash;some of which were touched on by my colleague Senator Hill&mdash;aspects of the committee system are not working particularly well at the moment and there is a need to look at arrangements to reinvigorate the system. At the same time, the Senate has shown a willingness to have a close look at its procedures to see how they can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the changes have not gone as far as I would have hoped, but I think a fair assessment over the last four years shows that some very important changes have taken place in the way that the Senate operates. The reference of bills committee procedure has been a very important change. We have seen attempts to tighten up question time. I do not think they have gone quite as far as I would have wanted, but nonetheless there has been a willingness to try to put pressure on the government to take question time more seriously and give more answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a greater use of select committees. These changes have been important. One of the things that has an influence on me&mdash;and maybe on others&mdash;is that the executive dominance of the House of Representatives has become greater and greater. An important change that has occurred in this parliament is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) no longer sees it necessary to attend every question time. That is an important change which I do not think has applied to any other parliament in the history of this nation. There is a mood among the public that parliament has to function more effectively. While the other place is reeling under the ruthless use of numbers by the executive it is not surprising that the system changes elsewhere to try to encourage a greater accountability by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray was quite right to raise the point that we are leading the charge in the Senate. Maybe the example of this chamber will spread elsewhere. It is in part a response to changes in the other place where the government is becoming less and less accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this a radical change? With the changes in the chairs of committees, the balance of incentives has been altered. We do not want to think ill of our opponents, but if one is a government chair of a committee it is not in the interests of the government or the Senate to pursue with great vigour a contentious issue which may cause embarrassment to ones colleagues and the government. I do not say that that has happened, but on the incentives basis there is not that need or desire to get out and investigate issues which may well cause some difficulty to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, as non-government senators will now be chairing committees there is more incentive for those people to show their spurs and to show what an effective committee system can do. This will cause a reinvigoration of the Senate committee system and a reassertion of what most people would understand to be the role of the parliament. We will act more effectively as a parliament. When we look back on this after a decade I will be surprised if we do not see this as radical reform&mdash;reform which will have major effects. It will cause problems to this government and to subsequent governments. Any change in the parliamentary system which requires governments to be more accountable has that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not now propose to move an amendment in relation to treaties. I congratulate Senator Harradine for reminding us that he has been one of the driving forces on the need for the Senate to look more closely at treaties. He has had a notice of motion to this effect in this place for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine would know that I am a strong supporter of that particular view that he holds. Senator Harradine's particular approach has much merit; that is, that the Senate look closely at what the executive is doing in relation to treaties. I have had discussions with Senator Bourne. She has said that, while she does not feel able to support the amendment I was about to move, nonetheless she has great sympathy with what I am trying to do and will discuss this issue very constructively with me over the next couple of days to see whether we cannot settle an arrangement which would achieve the objective of the Harradine motion of 10 years standing. I look forward to those discussions with Senator Bourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will leave my remarks there. This system, of course, can be looked at from a number of angles. Some senators will see the problems in the system; in other words, some will see the bottle as being half empty and others will see it as being half full. I am one of those who see the bottle as being probably two-thirds full. There are further changes and improvements that I would wish to make. Nonetheless, I think experience will show how this system operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in the Senate has shown that the committee system in this place by and large, with one overriding exception&mdash;and I am reminded of that one exception because Senator Schacht is now in the chamber&mdash;has worked pretty well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on two matters that have been raised and one that has not been raised. Senator Coulter spoke earlier about the composition and allocation of portfolios to the various committees and the naming of the committees. In reading through the report, I can see that the allocation of portfolios and departments particularly suits estimates committees and legislation references because, to a certain degree, they are virtually categorised under the various ministers as they represent those various portfolios. I can understand the reasoning behind that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when it comes to those same committees dealing with references, I can see some of those committees being overburdened with references as they refer to specific departments which tend to have more matters referred in relation to the areas that they represent. I can see, in some cases, some of the reference committees being asked to look at a number of inquiries but, in other cases, some of the others, as the departments are allocated by portfolio, tending to get far fewer references in general sent to them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that subcommittees can be used. But also, with the way they are set up, there has been a division of some of the existing committees, particularly where some long-term references are already under way. I just have some reservations about the allocation of portfolios to the reference committees, although I can understand, by way of legislation and estimates, why they have been allocated in that manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is one which was raised by Senator Coulter, with regard to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. He and I both happen to be on that committee whilst it deals with a particular reference. That committee, particularly, receives many references. It is to be subsumed with an economics committee which deals with treasury matters and industrial relations, which I do not believe are necessarily closely related matters. At some stage in the future there may be some need to look at whether the best allocation of portfolios and departments has been made in relation to the distribution of general references to committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third and last point has been mentioned already by Senator Kemp. In relation to reference committees, where there is generally by the end of the day a good deal of agreement and a report is printed which is generally agreed to by all members taking part in that committee, I think it would be a pity if a number of participating members or any one particular senator should choose to use participating membership of the committee to do a bit of kite flying which is in direct contradiction to the views of the participating nominated members of that committee who have been able to produce a unanimous report. I think that is another instance where it will be necessary to look carefully at the way committees are functioning, once these changes have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in general terms, I am in favour of the whole idea of having reference committees separate from other committees. In most cases, the reference committees are looking at matters which are of general concern and on which normally, at the end of the day, there is a great deal of consensus. I hope that those sorts of reports can be used to the benefit of the Senate and the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few points have been raised, the last one being about the allocation of portfolios and committees. I am sure that Senator Ferguson would understand just how difficult this is, especially getting a Senate estimates pattern. We have tried to allocate one minister to each estimates committee, for consistency's sake. That does not entirely replicate who that minister represents in this chamber on behalf of the other chamber either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really up to the committees to try to sort out, rather than in a territorial way, where there is an existing reference and how it continues on. That will require goodwill, as six of the reference committees will be controlled by the opposition and two by the Democrats. I am sure there will be no disagreement amongst those opposite in the power sharing with the division of these particular references! But if they cannot agree, we will use our numbers and sort it out for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, before I depart and before I get ruled out of order, I would like to give a procedural highlight. We have another eight items to consider. When we conclude this item and I leave the chamber, Senator Schacht will move them in toto. I understand that there are two amendments which have been circulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has listened to Senator Harradine's amendment; this is the one to delete the reference. We are not signed up for it. Senator Bourne may move it on Senator Harradine's behalf or he himself may move it. We do not see the necessity for it, but we certainly would not divide over it. We can see some merit in it, some against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is an opposition amendment about, really, the government responding to minority reports and/or all others. We have never been keen about this. We again will not divide on it. However, I want to put down for the record that, if this is carried, we will try to abide by it. But if it is totally abused, if 15 participating members all turn up and put in their own individual dissenting reports, we will only respond to each of those with no comment and we then would have formally met the request. Obviously, we will not do it in terms of genuine minority reports because, let us face it, I suspect that on a lot of these reference committees the minority reports will be by my good colleagues over here. We would want to also perhaps commend them for the hard work they have done. For the record, the government will attempt to abide by this particular item, unless it is abused&mdash;and then we will give it lip service.

<PARA>I want to draw attention to only one matter, and that is the starting date of 10 October 1994. The Procedure Committee, with its great concentration on all the other issues, did not actually agree on a date.

This is not a date that has been intruded by the government. The fact is that we have not given it a lot of thought, so we will accept this one.

I do not think that that is what estimates committees are for in any event. But if that thought had occurred to anybody, the fact that the government has the majority on those committees will obviously ensure that that will not take place. Indeed, I do not think it would take place anyhow because of the responsible attitude that other members of those committees have. I agree with the point made that ultimately it is the minister who has the responsibility. The minister&mdash;not the public servant&mdash;is the person with ministerial responsibility, answerable to the parliament, and should act appropriately.

As I understand it, going way back to when the estimates committees were first established, it was clear that, firstly, the government would have a majority on estimates committees and, secondly, ministers were there to answer the questions. That is the way it should be. If we take Senator Hill's view that officers can answer questions of their own volition and they get it wrong, who is responsible?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the basic tenets of the Australian Democrats' proposal to change the committee system is that this option be available to participating members.

I said that I did not want to see the occasion arise&mdash;and the possibility is there&mdash;of a participating or indeed a full member of any committee turning up with a dissenting or minority report, not having participated in the hearings by questioning witnesses, not having attended public and private committee meetings or perhaps having attended only one meeting.

Any member of this Senate who feels strongly about several issues would find it almost impossible to be on more than one committee. I know&mdash;I have tried and I am still trying. As all senators know, it is very difficult to be on a great many committees. It is okay for the government, the opposition and the Democrats because we have enough members to go around and can go to most of these committees and be full members of the committees. We will get our point of view across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However,  Senator  Harradine,  Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts do not have enough members to be on every one of these committees&mdash;and they feel strongly about more than one issue. If any one of us is prepared to be a full participating member in respect of any reference to a committee, and to put in the work on that reference, we should have every right of a full member of that committee. At the moment, the opposition can swap members of committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Bourne's position on this matter. It is one of the matters that was agreed to by the Procedure Committee as part of the package. On that basis, I ask Senator Hill to reconsider pressing this matter at this stage. One needs to envisage how things might happen in a real situation. If there is a unanimous report from members of the committee, it would be clear that one participating member attaching a minority comment would be in the minority. The relative weight of the attachment would be regarded appropriately by the Senate and the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a minority report and a majority report and one of the participating members says, `I happen to agree with the minority report,' that again is an indication to those looking at the report of relative interests. Senators may recall that I suggested we actually do away with the terms `majority' and `minority' reports and just call them reports of the committee&mdash;report A, report B or whatever&mdash;and let people judge their weight by the numbers of people signing them. I did not get my way on that, so I accept the agreement that there be the ability to have majority and dissenting reports and the ability for participating members, whether they be from the minor or major parties, to be associated with the majority or minority reports or to put in their own particular comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This all arose because of Senator Bourne's drawing attention to the possibility of participating members being abused. What she is saying is: rather than make a change to that now, let us see how it works out and if there is abuse by people putting themselves in as participating members but not really participating, maybe in the future we will change it to overcome that abuse. If there is an abuse by participating members who are there very nominally and just want to attach their own comments for the record, then that will be regarded appropriately in that light. If it happens too much, then we can come back here and fix it up to overcome the difficulty. </PARA>

Let us just accept that and see how it works, recognising that the Democrats, the Independents and Greens saw this as an important part of the package. I do not think it is a big problem.

It is theoretically possible to seek to have one's name substituted for that of another senator but, as the committees are comprised, the committees have only one senator who is not from the government or the opposition; that is, one senator from the Democrats or the Greens, or me.

There is the possibility that that government majority may well not cover matters that demand answers from the government; therefore, in many ways, the minority report might be the part that requires answers rather than the majority report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to mention two other matters that flow from the changes that are about to be made and this is the only opportunity to do so. The first concerns the transition and how existing references will be dealt with. I want to put on the record how I think they should be dealt with. Obviously there are some major inquiries that are part heard. We will now have new committees in some instances covering a different mix of portfolios. No doubt, there will be changes in the composition of the committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes we are about to make will require a new committee to continue with a reference that had been given to what is described as a predecessor committee. It becomes obvious that, if there are inquiries that are not concluded after 10 October, the new committees will take on where the old committees left off. However, it would obviously be unwise if it were the new members that took on that responsibility because they would not have heard the evidence that had been put. I presume, therefore, that as a matter of practice we will adopt the facility that will be provided to appoint substitutes for any particular matter before a committee. The substitutes in this instance would be those who constituted the committee that had been taking evidence under the old system. That is certainly how I envisage we would adapt to the transition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these inquiries are obviously very important. There is the inquiry into the CSIRO which particularly interests me. It is taking a lot of complex evidence and it would be a nonsense if a new committee composed of new people had to try to pick up where the old committee had left off. I am not sure whether that was intended by the draughtsman of these changes, but certainly that is the way I interpret that they should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is that the number of chairs has been approximately determined on a basis to better reflect the number of parties and independents within this chamber. Reference to the `Leader of the Government' determining those numbers refers to the government of the day&mdash;that is, the ALP. In the event of what we anticipate will happen at the next election&mdash;that the government changes&mdash;we are likely not only to be in government but also to have a significantly larger number of senators than the ALP opposition at that time. </PARA>

In many ways that is an inappropriate thing to write into a standing order. I presume that is why there has not been an attempt to do so. But, because it is inappropriate to write it into the standing orders, the basis upon which these numbers have been determined should nevertheless be put on the record so that after the next election, and subsequent elections, when there must then be a renegotiation according to the numbers in the chamber, those who then conduct that renegotiation will be aware of the basis upon which these changes were made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(11.48 a.m.)&mdash;I support the remarks of Senator Hill with regard to the need in this debate to make quite clear the rationale for the determination of the composition of committees and the determination of the chairs of committees. It is quite unequivocal that the Procedure Committee sought a distribution of chairs that was reflective of the composition of this Senate and that that would be a principle we would expect to see happen, whoever was in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the numbers in the two main kinds of committees in each of the eight areas&mdash;that is, eight members for the references committees and six members for the estimates and legislation committees&mdash;there is a composition whereby the government provides three members out of the eight members for a reference committee, the opposition provides four members out of the eight, and the minority parties and others provide one member. With regard to the six members of an estimates or legislation committee, the government provides three members, the opposition provides two members, and the others provide one member. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wanted to be pedantic, one way to refine that to be more exact would be to allow in five of the eight committees four members and in three of the eight committees three members and such other complicated proportions that would have more directly reflected the exact mathematics of the distribution in the chamber. But, of course, we did not become pedantic; we did not go to that degree of detail in the matter that is just about to be resolved by the Senate. Rather, we took the broad principle that we were seeking a committee structure which would, overall, reflect the composition of the Senate through the distribution of chairs of committees. That principle must be acknowledged. In the future we will seek to uphold that principle, whatever the outcome of subsequent elections to the Senate and whatever the composition of the Senate.

I hope they get at least one, and I look forward to seeing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that the percentage of seats in the Senate&mdash;this will not add up to 100 per cent because it is 0.05 per cent in a couple of them&mdash;is 40 per cent Australian Labor Party, 40 per cent Liberal Party, eight per cent National Party of Australia, nine per cent Australian Democrats and four per cent others. The percentage of chairs of all of these is: 47 per cent ALP; 47 per cent Liberal and National&mdash;so they are both over their representation&mdash;seven per cent Democrat, so we are under our representation; and none for others, so they are well and truly under their representation. </PARA>

I have a little worry about the mere fact of Senator Hill having raised this, despite having agreed that we were putting this matter into the standing orders to ensure that it applied after the next election. He also wants to cover his bets on it. Although the basic proposal of sharing the chairs was not initially supported by the government, we recognised that as the package was pulled together we could get agreement on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support the amendments. Although Senator Spindler has an objective in mind, what he is proposing may have a number of unintended consequences. My advice is that the Service and Execution of Process Act does provide for interstate service of process issued by state and territory courts and tribunals but that it constitutes a very small proportion of process served in Australia. It does not, for instance, include process issued by federal courts or state or territory process that is served within the jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that aside, there are many drafting problems with the amendments about which I have been informed. For instance, the words in the amendment `process to which this act applies' are not defined under SEPA. As a consequence, it could mean any process issued by a state or territory court or tribunal, since SEPA allows such process to be served. I am not sure that Senator Spindler wants to go that far. Even if he does, the reference to SEPA may have been used in this way to provide a constitutional nexus, and I am not so sure that that is something we should be going into without a broader consideration of all the issues involved. There are those sorts of unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, those words cannot refer to a process which has been served under SEPA because the amendment purports to prescribe alternative services, and so on. The other definitional problem relates to the words `process in relation to debt'. Those words are very broad and in fact would include subpoenas. However, from the related amendment it seems that the amendment is probably not intended to apply to cases where the protected person is sought as a witness. We have that confusion about the role of subpoenas. If the amendment is intended to apply to subpoenas, it is difficult to see why the words of this amendment are limited to a narrow range of proceedings. There are all sorts of unintended consequences which flow from amendment No. 6 in combination with amendments Nos 10 and 11. Because of that, the government does not support these three amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the government has further amendments to 26A. I wonder whether Senator Spindler might like to consider, on the run, adding to 28A(1)(a), after `the general operations performance and effectiveness of the national witness protection program', either these words or words to this effect: `and in particular the exercise of the commissioner's powers under clause 26A', which, of course, would mean that the commissioner would have to report to the minister on the exercise of the powers under 26A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the powers, as Senator Spindler is probably aware, that enable the commissioner to decide the circumstances under which he will make known to a court and to defence counsel information on the record of a protected witness giving evidence in a subsequent and further matter. I will not rehash the debate completely, but this matter has very serious consequences for an innocent citizen, if we are talking only about criminal matters, and for all citizens if we are talking about civil matters where the reliability of the witness concerned might be crucial to the conviction of a party or crucial to the success or loss of a civil claim with a financial consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reliability of the witness might be crucial. It is all very well for us to sit here and say, `That would not happen very often, so that would be fine.' All I am suggesting is that the commissioner would have to report to the minister. Senator Spindler's proposed new subclause 28A(2) would mean that, in consultation with the commissioner, the minister would have to give some indication to parliament as to what had happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that we will all find that the reports would indicate that nothing much happened, for quite a few years. It is quite a rare circumstance that we are talking about whereby someone who has been a protected witness in some criminal proceedings later becomes a non-protected witness under that person's new identity in other proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is short shrift to say to someone involved in those later proceedings, `Bad luck, you didn't get to test the veracity of a witness; that has cost you something because years ago we decided to have this witness protection program.' I do not think it will happen very often. Therefore, the reporting would hardly be onerous. It would probably be once every five or six years that the commissioner will have to make this decision. But I, for one, think the parliament ought to be interested when he or she does make that decision in later days and have an opportunity to see whether that power has been appropriately exercised. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That memorandum stated that there could well be incriminating material which could be used unfairly against the witness; the theme in that regard being that if people were to assist the court in giving evidence there would be no need for people to put their necks on the line and disclose a lot of other incriminating information.

A national program for the protection of witnesses has been long overdue, especially with the escalation of organised crime that we have seen in recent years. Whilst the majority of protected witnesses might involve organised crime, there are the odd occasions where a witness might need protection.

Furthermore, there may be a case where a person wants protection but is not taken onto the program. Whilst not having a public avenue of appeal, I think perhaps the government could keep an eye on how that is done and how that aspect of refusal is looked at. I appreciate the need for security there but, nonetheless, I think that is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 26A, which has now been inserted, goes some way to allaying the fears that I and others who appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had, and that was that a participant in this program could subsequently appear in another proceeding and have shielded from the court his or her criminal record. I think the amendment proposed by Senator Vanstone in relation to the Democrats' amendment was a sensible one that provides some sort of ongoing review of how this discretion is exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I put this warning to the Senate that if the commissioner decides that a record should not be released or made available then, of course, the exercise of that discretion will subsequently be made known to the ombudsman and the commissioner would report to the minister. That could be closing the gate after the horse has bolted and that could well be perhaps too late for a party to the previous proceedings who could well have used that record in a quite useful manner. I dare say if that did come to light that could be a ground of appeal for a retrial and I trust that is how it would be looked at. They are my concerns in relation to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also ask the government to keep an eye on the removal of witnesses from the program. It is only going to induce people to give this crucial evidence if it can tell them that they are not going to be left in the cold, that they are not going to be removed without good cause or reason. Therefore, I add another caveat to my address on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994, it is probably pertinent to go back to sometime earlier this year, or perhaps even late last year, when amendments were made by the minister to the burden of proof in police complaints and disciplinary matters. We were very concerned that that was an inappropriate change to make at that time. The burden of proof was lowered; that is, someone who wanted to be successful against a police officer had to show less in order to be successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police felt somewhat at risk by that change, and they particularly felt at risk when they did not have a number of protections that they felt they needed: for example, protection from people making false complaints or giving false information. It is one of the easiest tricks in the book for people of criminal mind to make false complaints and unsettle a police officer and have him or her taken off an investigation. Apart from the cost, time and effort involved, it has an enormous impact on the officer and the investigation that he or she is undertaking at the time. I understand that the minister at the time indicated that appropriate changes would be made and that those protections would be put in place. Finally, we are very pleased to see a bill that does that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill extends its coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff, who are therefore no longer excluded from the complaints regime. The bill creates new offences of making a false complaint or giving false information, and victimisation of a complainant or a person assisting in the investigation of a complaint. The bill provides for investigations by the ombudsman's own motion, which is a good thing. The bill also provides that evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation is admissible in disciplinary hearings. The bill also abolishes the requirement that hearings of complaint based disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. There is an option of a tribunal hearing if it happens to be in the public interest. There are other minor amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supportive of the bill, but we have some concerns and, for that reason, we would like the bill to be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The concerns were raised with us by the Law Council of Australia, and they are basically four in number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first concern is that yes, evidence taken before an ombudsman should be admissible, but there should be a corresponding obligation on the prosecution of disclosure of such material in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern is that the complaint and any statement made by the complainant should be privileged from production in proceedings relating to separate criminal charges against the complainant, except, of course, if they are clause 6 charges, namely, making a false complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale there is that police are entitled to do only what the legislation entitles them to do, and they are not entitled to go beyond that; and citizens should be not only entitled but encouraged to complain when those boundaries are overstepped. However, if in order to make that complaint people had to put themselves at risk by some activity they had undertaken, that would be a disincentive for them. We are not sure of the arguments on both sides. Therefore, we believe that it should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so that the whole chamber can hear both sides of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council also raises the interesting point that, with this new offence of making a false complaint or giving false information, it might be appropriate to say that before such a conviction can be sustained some of the material should be corroborated. The Law Council puts the view that, in a sense, this is very similar to a charge of perjury, which requires corroboration, and the policy considerations justifying independent confirmation of the allegations are the same. We have not made a decision on that, but it is an interesting point with respect to which we would like to hear the arguments on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is a little concern about the ability of the AFP to launch prosecutions under clause 6, that is, false complaint. We understand that there is a requirement to consult the ombudsman with respect to such prosecutions, but there is absolutely no obligation to take the ombudsman's advice. It may be that we should be saying that a prosecution of false complaint cannot be launched by the AFP unless the ombudsman has positively agreed that such a prosecution should be launched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This works both ways. Just as someone with a poor motive can make a false complaint against a genuinely decent police officer, so a police officer who has in one way or another overstepped the mark and who simply believes that it cannot be proved might for reasons of malice or vindictiveness&mdash;perhaps sending a message to people who want to make complaints against the police&mdash;launch a prosecution against that person. There is an interest on both sides to do the wrong thing, if you like, where there are people of bad faith. We do not think it is fair to assume necessarily that people of bad faith are only those who make the complaint; nor to assume that the people of good faith are only ever found in the AFP. Unfortunately, people of bad faith are found everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think the arguments in favour of requiring the consent of the ombudsman before a prosecution should be launched are quite attractive, but I would like to hear the opposing arguments as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we indicate that we are supportive of this bill and the changes it is making. We think the Law Council has raised some sensible concerns and we want the matter referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for report on these matters. If, prior to the legal and constitutional affairs committee having a hearing on these matters, the government responds to these concerns in such a way that it satisfies ourselves and other parties interested in these concerns, we would be happy to cancel such a hearing and accept the changes. That might require a private meeting of the committee prior to public hearings to listen to what the government is prepared to offer&mdash;if the government is interested in approaching it on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, which governs the handling of complaints made by the public or by AFP members, including disciplinary measures consequent upon a complaint, and also disciplinary appeals. On the point raised by Senator Vanstone and the issues raised by the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Democrats also look forward to the government's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the bill arise out of an interdepartmental working group established in 1991. The working group produced a series of amendments that do not so much alter the policy principles of the act as eliminate certain anomalies and meet practical concerns arising out of the operation of the act since its commencement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the major amendments is to extend the act's coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff. This is necessary, given the increasing interrelationship of the duties of members and staff members. It is understood, however, that complaints are always likely to be more common in relation to those exercising police powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the major amendments concerns the creation of two new offences. The first offence is that of providing what the offender knows to be materially false information to an AFP appointee in relation to a complaint or action taken by an AFP appointee. The second offence relates to the victimisation of a complainant or a person assisting in the investigation of a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment gives the ombudsman the capacity to investigate on his or her own motion action by a member or staff member of the AFP. Currently, under the Ombudsman's Act 1976, the ombudsman can initiate investigations of administrative actions on his or her own motion. However, the principal act does not make the equivalent provision for the investigation of complaints against AFP members. This amendment will rectify this anomaly and is particularly welcomed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might refer briefly to the events which gave rise to the working party and which produced, amongst others, this particular amendment. Those events consisted of the complaints against police behaviour at the AIDEX demonstration. I had occasion to channel those complaints to the ombudsman. I place on record my appreciation for the constructive process of consultation that has been carried out since then between the AFP and the ombudsman's office with the result that these amendments are now in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth of the major amendments makes evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation admissible in disciplinary hearings. The proposed amendment will put the ombudsman on the level with the investigative division in this regard by removing a restriction on admissibility of evidence which undermines the position of the ombudsman as the investigator of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final of the major amendments abolishes the requirement that hearings of complaint based disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. In the working group process the AFP proposed that section 67(1) of the principal act should be amended to allow the AFP commissioner to determine cases arising from complaints where an AFP member pleads guilty. The AFP argued that the present procedures, which require that disciplinary proceedings arising from complaints be referred to the tribunal for rehearing, even where the accused pleads guilty, involve unnecessary delays and waste the time of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department, while accepting that there were problems with delay, argued that the present procedures had been consciously adopted in the legislation to ensure that the results of complaints investigations were sufficiently publicised and that the `concept of police judging police in complaints matters has been criticised by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody so that any attempt to expand the police role would be politically inopportune at present'. The working group therefore recommended that the principal act not be amended as proposed by the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I note that in clause 16 the government has chosen to accept the AFP's arguments to the extent that it is a matter to be determined by the AFP commissioner as to whether the commissioner may deal with the matter or refer the undisputed charge to the tribunal. Significantly, however, in this situation, if the ombudsman does not consent in writing to the commissioner's decision the Attorney-General is required to direct how the proceeding will be dealt with. While we do not intend to oppose this provision, we note for the record the need to monitor its practical effectiveness and that it should be reviewed at some point in the future, if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the Australian Democrats, in general, welcome these amendments and will support the bill, subject to investigation of the matters raised by the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address certain elements in the media who are incapable of grasping the debate over Tasmania's criminal code. It is more to do with our federalist system of government and states rights and Australia's sovereignty as opposed to what two people may or may not want to do in the privacy of their own bedroom. In particular, I refer to Margo Kingston's commentary in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> which was under the heading `The Senator might like to reconsider'. I took up her invitation to reconsider. All it has done is confirm that the views expressed by me were appropriate; the arguments that she sought to throw up against me were incapable of damaging the argument that I had put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second paragraph of her commentary makes the bold assertion that the Tasmanian laws allegedly deal with oral sex. Clearly they do not; there is a decided case in the Tasmanian Supreme Court&mdash;a decision of Mr Justice Underwood&mdash;which clearly says they do not. Yet for some reason best known to herself she makes that assertion. I know that assertion has been pedalled by certain other elements but clearly it is incorrect. If somebody ought to be reconsidering, possibly it ought to be Ms Kingston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What follows after that glaring error is, with respect, an erudite summary of mainstream thought on this issue. In case colleagues do not realise, what she did was quote my media release in full and for that I thank her. After quoting my release, she continues her commentary. With her assertive heading asking me to reconsider, I read with interest that there was no basis for me to reconsider and simply confirmed that the opposition to the views expressed was bereft of principle or logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She attempts slight sarcasm by referring to me as a man `skilled in legal reasoning' who may be willing to reconsider some errors in his release. Let us consider them. She says the law of incest is completely untouched by the reform. I simply ask: how does she draw that conclusion? The Attorney-General's media release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will introduce a Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill to ensure that the privacy of sexual conduct between consenting adults is protected from unreasonable legal interference.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not say that the Attorney-General and the Labor government are specifically going to exclude incest. If we are going to rely on this overriding right to privacy, surely incest must be allowed as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where I have got one over Ms Kingston is in the capacity to think laterally and to interpret and consider the consequences flowing from changes to law or annunciations of a so-called unfettered right. It is interesting to note by implication that Margo Kingston would also continue to outlaw incest. On that, she and I are in agreement. The question arises, and I pose it: if there is this inalienable right to privacy, surely incest and drug taking in private ought to be decriminalised as well? There needs to be a consistency in the reasoning. What we need to comprehend is that the law is based on moral codes and principles. Because of that, there are obviously going to be disagreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises: who is best suited to determine the moral code of Tasmanians? Who is best suited to make the decisions as to how Australians or Tasmanians or people in the various states ought to live? Is it the champagne charlies of the United Nations? Is it the unelected people on the human rights commission or ought it be the people of Tasmania? I declare unashamedly my commitment and bias towards democracy as opposed to the thought police of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of criticism is that poll after poll has shown that the majority of Tasmanians support the repeal of the state's unnatural sex ban. Let us examine Ms Kingston's assertion that poll after poll has shown that the majority of Tasmanians support a change in the law. There are no polls that show such a support for change other than polls commissioned by the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group. Its latest poll has shown a five per cent decrease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Green senator interjects and says, `How awful.' Let us talk about a truly independent and authoritative poll. The ABC and the University of Tasmania commissioned a poll recently. We could hardly call either of those bodies hotbeds of homophobics or states rightists. Those bodies commissioned the poll on a professional basis. It was a very illuminating poll. The questions asked included:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you believe the current Tasmanian laws relating to homosexual acts are fair or unfair?</PARA>
<PARA>The poll shows that 49.2 per cent believed they were fair, 46.1 per cent argued they were unfair and 4.7 per cent were unable to comment. The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think these laws should be changed?</PARA>
<PARA>The poll shows that 50.7 per cent said no. Those who said that the laws ought to be changed were then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How should they be changed? Toughened or liberalised?</PARA>
<PARA>Some of those who sought support for a change to the law were arguing that the laws ought to be toughened up. When that percentage is taken into account, 54 per cent of Tasmanians want the law to remain as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fundamental question, and this is the point that I have been addressing time and time again, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you believe the Commonwealth government should enforce the UN resolution on gay law reform if the Tasmanian government does not act?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer here was overwhelmingly against the federal government becoming involved at a ratio of more than two to one&mdash;that is, two-thirds of Tasmanians oppose federal intervention. I have quoted my source. I challenge Ms Kingston to quote her source. She of course conveniently does not do that in her article; she simply makes the bold assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Kingston then deals with the question of Tasmanian democracy. She says that twice in the 1990s the Tasmanian lower house introduced and passed a repeal law that was then knocked back by the Tasmanian upper house. That is what happens with a bicameral system of parliament: that is the process of democracy. However, she failed to tell her readers that the government that introduced that legislation in Tasmania was swept from office by a landslide victory to the Liberal government which went to the people on a policy of retaining the current law. At the end of the day, that is democracy; is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to believe that the people of Australia made a huge mistake at the last election by re-electing the Labor government, but I accept that. I did not run off and squeal to some international court saying, `I don't like the democratic process in Australia. I don't happen to agree with the result and I want you to overturn it.' This is a very real threat to our democracy. When the will of the people is overturned by an unelected group not responsible or accountable to the people, it provides fuel to the fire for those radical elements within our community who would like to see the overthrow of democracy, and who can point to issues such as this and say that they voted for a government that supports this type of legislation. Be it right, wrong or indifferent, they have elected this government but the democratic process has been subverted and therefore democracy has been undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some fundamental tenets of democracy. First, when the people make their decision collectively in an election, they are allowed to make the wrong decision. As I pointed out, the people of Australia made the wrong decision by re-electing the Labor government federally but we are stuck with it until the next election. The second fundamental tenet of democracy is that the people can change their parliament, their government. They can elect a new government to change the laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, by February 1996 they will have had the opportunity to elect a new government on a policy of repealing these laws if that is what the people of Tasmania want. The third fundamental point of a democracy is that if a judiciary makes a ruling with which people disagree, then it can be overturned by legislation or referendum; but now, with the United Nations and its rulings, we in Australia can have 1,000 elections, we can have 2,000 referenda, and still not overturn the United Nations decision. According to international lawyers we cannot change the UN ruling and covenant without the consent of the world body. That is why I said it is an affront to an Australian democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, let us listen to Gough Whitlam. What did Gough Whitlam say in arguing against appeals to the Privy Council? Gough Whitlam said it was entirely anomalous and archaic for Australian citizens to litigate their differences in another country before judges appointed by the government of that other country. I ask the senators opposite, the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party: what is the difference between the United Nations and foreign countries in being unelected and unresponsive to the people of Australia? There is absolutely no difference. We would hardly call Gough Whitlam a homophobe or a states rightist, would we?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor decision is also representative of the breathtaking arrogance of Labor in its attitude that all wisdom resides in Canberra and in the United Nations committees. I unreservedly say that wisdom lies with the people. At the end of the day I suppose I will be condemned for being an old-fashioned type of guy with an outmoded view because I believe in democracy and its processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third comment of Ms Kingston was that the proposed law does not override Tasmania's law. I am sure that would come as a shock to the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party. Everybody would acknowledge that the law will override Tasmania's law. If it did not, why on earth introduce it? Yet for some reason that completely escapes me, that assertion is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commentary then deals with the right to privacy. I simply say that an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS> is well worth reading today. In relation to privacy it is simply a question of where we draw the line. There will be argument and debate over that, that is fine. But the question is: who should resolve that conflict and draw the line? I unashamedly say it ought to be the people. In a country that professes multiculturalism and cultural diversity, Tasmanians are not allowed to have laws that meet their needs and requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Kingston's final paragraph is particularly distasteful. In political debate one always accepts that one will be attacked, vilified and criticised. That is what politics is. But I say to her and to every journalist in this country: leave my family and children out of it. For the record, I say that my children will always have my unconditional love, no matter what; but what my newly born son has got to do with this issue is absolutely beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I do hope, Madam Acting Deputy President, is that my children will inherit an Australia where if they want to they can change the democratic laws of their country or their state through its own sovereign and democratic processes, and not be thwarted by the thought police of the United Nations.

It has certainly been in an active form since the oil price shock of 1974 and the energy crisis when OPEC raised prices. Suddenly the industrial world had to come to terms with just how dependent we are on energy, and specifically on oil. Today we are more dependent than ever, and with far fewer options for new supply since the minor oilfields discovered after OPEC, including Bass Strait, have nearly all gone into decline. For many reasons, oil is priced at levels similar to those before OPEC was formed.</PARA></TALK.START>

In Australia it accounts for 37 per cent of total energy use and 49 per cent of energy end use. We are petroleum dependent. Our transport&mdash;land, sea and air&mdash;is virtually completely dependent on petroleum and uses over 30 per cent of end use energy. Our agriculture is highly mechanised and virtually totally dependent on petroleum products. Mining is almost entirely petroleum dependent. One reason that so much energy is used in transport is that production is heavily centralised and almost all our goods are transported over long distances. Our imports and exports are dependent, in terms of cost and competitiveness, on both energy content and transport costs. Petroleum also forms an important input in the production of fertilisers and plastics. </PARA>

In it he outlines the fact that the major issue of sustainability of oil supply is not whether it will run out, but whether supply factors will make it far more expensive.

This is mainly because of strong demand for currency in the Middle East in connection with the Gulf War, and the continued seller push on oil from the ex-Comecon nations. But many of the oilfields found since the energy crisis, such as the North Sea and Indonesian fields, are now running out. In addition, the low price of oil has meant that many oilfields have not had the investment which would allow the technical extension of their lifespan and production capabilities. This is likely to result in a situation where demand exceeds supply in the near future, and where any attempt to increase supply is likely to have a relatively high cost. As a consequence, the cost of oil itself is virtually certain to rise substantially over the next decade, due to market forces and the need for higher levels of investment in capital intensive technologies to extend the life of existing fields and develop more difficult fields such as those offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Fleay's paper outlines the situation and notes the technical, economic and political factors that will lead to an inevitable, substantial and sustained rise in average oil prices. Such a situation would be devastating to the Australian economy unless we act with urgency to change the structural use of oil. While there are alternatives to oil, such alternatives for uses are few and are technologically undeveloped. The liquefaction of coal is not near being an economically viable alternative. The frequently promoted use of ethanol runs into major problems in trying to extend it to actual replacement of petroleum. It is great as an additive to substitute for lead, or even as an extender of petroleum, but the more ethanol that is needed, the more plant biomass is required. Attempts at large scale production run into problems with the use of arable land&mdash;the use of mechanised farming and the long transport chains&mdash;and ultimately leads to soil depletion as nutrients leave the farm with plant resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, if people are going to grow fuel they have all the problems that exist in relation to agriculture. They would be less able to grow other crops. The long transport lines and dispersal of goods, as in agriculture and forestry, mean nutrients are transferred from the area of growing to the area of consumption, and are generally not returned. Australia continues to structure its cities, its transport systems and its economy on the basis of cheap transport, often privately owned. We are already experiencing problems with the high cost of infrastructure per capita due to the consequent urban sprawl. This is a micro-economic issue which consistently drives up rates and taxes, while making many alternatives such as recycling or public transport difficult. The high cost of roads and parking facilities to cope with private transport is another issue. This includes not only the cost of construction but the cost of maintenance year after year, and replacement and upgrading within 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Fleay's grim report outlines the problem in physical and engineering terms. It notes the economic consequences, but it does not attempt to present any solutions or link the situation strongly to patterns of use. Patterns of use are the other side of the equation. Australia is an extremely high user of oil per capita and per dollar produced. It has done almost nothing to improve efficiency at a time when most developed nations have made major efforts in this regard. We are constantly among the highest per capita producers of greenhouse emissions in the world; but it was economics, not greenhouse, that motivated other nations to take energy efficiency on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first oil shock, and subsequent ones, stimulated a move to increase energy efficiency and reduce oil dependency that has carried through until today. Concerns on price and balance of trade have been extended to concerns on pollution from various energy sources, especially cars. Cars have become far more efficient, but urban sprawl and industry have meant that they now go further than ever on a daily basis and need more roads. Massive centralisation of industry and agriculture has meant that agriculture is more dependent than ever on fuel. We have had the ridiculous situation where vegies grown on the Ord Basin are shipped by road to Perth and individually wrapped in plastic on styrofoam trays&mdash;all of which are petroleum products&mdash;and then sent back on trucks to the stores in Broome and Derby. We have a situation where bricks are carted from Perth and Geraldton to Darwin, because the Northern Territory brickworks was closed down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With lead in petrol, we have now seen how long it takes to make even simple changes to the structures in place. Nearly 10 years after leaded petrol engines were banned in new cars, over half of the car fleet still uses leaded petrol. This is a simple technological change. To change to an entirely different fuel, especially if this requires the development of an entirely different technology, will take much longer. There is lag time in any response. On the other hand, we have seen how quickly oil prices can change. They can double overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had 20 years grace to understand the problems and take some action. Other nations have used this time, but we have not. We have not substantially improved our consumption pattern. We have not changed our attitude to transport. We have not done anything to change the structure of our cities, even though that would improve many micro-economic parameters relating to cost and delivery of infrastructure services. We have not done anything to reduce the need for roads. We have not done anything to improve the efficiency of energy production or use. I will not address these at length, since much of that is related to non-petroleum fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done nothing. Other nations have worked on developing alternatives and changing the structures of energy use, although some of the impetus from this has slackened due to the artificially low current cost of oil. We have failed to do this. We are now talking about going to the climate change convention and calling for a special dispensation because we are such heavy users. In essence, we are going to say, `We didn't do anything, so we use a lot; so we should be allowed to keep using it or be compensated for our irresponsibility'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not done anything. We keep insisting that not enough is known and that it will cost too much. We might play these games in respect of climate change measures, but economics will get us in the end. The original push for energy efficiency was economic, and it will become economic again. If we are not ready to respond to the challenge, no-one is going to have any sympathy. The impact of a drastic rise in oil price will be crushing. We will be able to kiss any hope of economic recovery goodbye for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To become ready requires advance work. There is a lag time of at least 10 to 15 years. It is probably already too late to position ourselves well for a drastic rise, but we can at least reduce the impact and the effect of this lag. To do this means taking energy efficiency seriously now. It means doing something to reduce the structural demand for oil, and doing it now. It means specifically finding ways of equitably reducing the use of private vehicles&mdash;ways that will enhance our quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is possible, but not if we ignore it. The longer we wait, the faster we will be forced to change later. The further we go the wrong way, the harder and more expensive the change will be. We can make a strong commitment now and use our current economic recovery and the time available to develop alternatives, to make an easier transition, and to find equitable and life enhancing ways to make the change. If we wait until we are forced to act by economic disaster, many of these options will simply not be open to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of the situation presented in Brian Fleay's report are serious considerations for Australia. The changes he outlines are liable to have major effects: a balance of trade outflow of several billion dollars per year, a real loss in competitive position on a number of areas in trade, perhaps even problems with food self-sufficiency. We are probably late already, but there is still some time to act if we are quick and resolute. I feel this report is of vital importance today, so I seek leave to table it at this time. </PARA>

The fires have had an appalling effect on the area. I must say they have called into question the merit of the large volume of pine plantations that the Turkish government, for very sound reasons, had put in that area. Nonetheless, I want to say that my visit to Gallipoli was arranged by the Turkish authorities and I am very grateful to them for having done that. That visit took place in January and the hospitality was astounding. I am assured that all Australians who visit the area receive outstanding hospitality from the Turks. They regard the area as very important to their own history because it was as a result of Kemal Ataturk's successes there against the Allied forces that he was able to get the status to become the most outstanding Turkish leader of modern times, and to revolutionise that nation and bring it forward so dramatically into the 20th century.

Mr Graham Lee is at the local university there. His encyclopedic knowledge of that campaign made him an outstanding guide. We became good friends, such good friends that he has written me a day by day account of the fires. I think it is important and I would like to read it into the record because it seems to me that not enough is known in Australia about those fires and their devastating impact on this enormously important part of Australia's heritage. Graham Lee's account reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mon 25/7/94 (late evening)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody paid much attention this afternoon when smoke from a small field fire appeared on the hills over the Dardanelles. Only last week another stubble-clearing operation by a local farmer had got out of hand and resulted in an area of farmland on the plateau behind the village and fortress of Kilit Bahir being burnt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As day turned into night however, crowds strolling along the seafront at Canakkale, the main town in the area, stared over the water as a huge conflagration ranged out of control along a 20 km front on the far side of the Gallipoli peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole horizon glowed red under a dense black cloud as fire consumed the heavily forested hills and valleys interspersed with recently harvested wheat fields and olive groves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A surreal atmosphere prevailed; people continued buying icecream and chatting along the sea front cafes, speculating about the villages, the farms, the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Towards midnight as the inferno caught groups of tall trees the sky lit up brightly and through the dense smoke red gashes of heat were seen at intervals crawling their way upwards towards the ridge on which stands the New Zealand Memorial, a testament to the bravery of the men who fought to their last drop of blood on that parched crest during the vital and decisive battle of 6-10 August, 1915.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This summer temperatures were high, as normal, and the humidity above average and the winds sweeping south down the Dardanelles fiercer than for a few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pushed by the wind the fire surged down the peninsula, away from the town of Eceabat and towards the sea on the other side, the Gulf of Saros, where the Anzacs landed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the evening streams of empty trucks from the naval base at Canakkale raced along the seafront to be shuttled over to the other side of the Straits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Titbits of information began filtering over. The Director of the National Park had been killed. Villages were being evacuated. Eight soldiers had been killed. Crowds began gathering near the ferry turnstiles awaiting relatives fleeing from the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the indistinct confusion of hills that criss-cross the peninsula it was impossible to discern which villages were at risk and which might already have been engulfed by the flames. Most endangered were Kocadere and Bigali. Here was based in 1915 the reserve division under the command of Mustafa Kemal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Kemal Ataturk&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As news came in of landings in the early hours of April 25, Mustafa Kemal quickly mobilised his troops up to the ridge to confront the Anzacs advancing on the other side, hindered by the steep dead-end gulleys and thick prickly scrub.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now covered with pine forests planted after the area was declared a national park in the 1950's, locals were well aware that once the trees were alight the red-hot pine cones would shoot like a fireball distances of 50 metres or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the whole horizon alight to the northernmost extent of the Gallipoli National Park it seemed possible that the roaring winds would drive the fire southwards all the way to the tip of the peninsula 30 km away where further cemeteries and memorials commemorated the losses of the British and French.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tues 26/7/94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With morning the scene appeared calm, smoke arising from only one distant hill but by afternoon the inexhaustible wind had picked up the fire once again and white smoke was billowing into the air along a front at least seven km long, further away this time, somewhere near Anzac Cove.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newspapers were devoid of any mention of the fire but local and national television gave extensive coverage, bemoaning the fact that the April 5 economic measures prevented planes from being used in the firefighting. The emergency services were totally reliant on fire tenders, and bulldozers. Over one thousand soldiers had been sent over to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the day came clarification and more rumours. It was the Director of Forests, not the National Park, who had died the previous night, overcome by smoke as he was directing operations. The missing soldiers had been found but over 250 people were unaccounted for. Generally the fire had been contained but the danger was far from over. Attention focused on the Kabatepe headland, ironically the original intended landing place for the Anzacs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous evening hundreds of campers at the official forest camp site at Kabatepe had hurriedly abandoned their belongings in panic and been directed to head south, in a convoy of vehicles on a roundabout route that would bring them round to the safety of the other side of the peninsula. Today some of them returned, three university students luckily finding their tent untouched but reporting many others burnt to the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kabatepe Museum, where Anzac and Turkish veterans had met once again in emotional reunions on the recent anniversary celebrations, was either untouched or a burnt out shell, opinions differed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only remaining danger was at Kumkamp, a campsite and cluster of beach huts and summer houses about eight km south of Kabatepe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wed 27/7/94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A day of mourning and reflection. The funeral of the Forests Director attended by hundreds of people. There were no other confirmed deaths, but four or five others were still lost unaccounted for, almost certainly overcome by the flames in the chaos of the first evening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fire was reported to have destroyed three quarters of the trees in the Gallipoli Peninsula National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lesson had been learnt, the hard way, and from now on it is likely that the less combustible oak will be planted in reforestation programmes in place of the pine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even while the fire at Gallipoli was in its dying stages, other forest fires had broken out elsewhere, a particularly one at Balikesir just a few hundred kilometres away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The source of the fire, personally witnessed though not officially confirmed, was the stubble burning, most likely without the official sanction that is required and certainly against logic given the strength of the winds that day, by a previous `muhtar' (village headman) at the village of Yalova, north of Anzac.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tours of Anzac were resumed today and backpacking Aussies and Kiwis were at last able to confirm the true extent of the damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kabatepe Museum was intact but closed. The Anzac cemeteries and memorials at Ari Burnu, Anzac Cove and Beach, where John Simpson is buried, were largely unscathed but the bushes on the surrounding hillsides were now ashes. Shrapnel Valley, the main supply route up to the front line from which Simpson and his donkey ceaselessly ferried the wounded back to the shoreline, was completely gutted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lone Pine tree itself was miraculously saved from the inferno but the trees all around the Australian Memorial were devastated and the grass right up to the steps of the memorial itself were singed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All along the ridge it was the same&mdash;cemeteries at Quinn's Post, Courtney's Post and the recently-erected spectacular monument to the Turkish 57th Regiment unaffected&mdash;while the once-green valleys on either side now black and lifeless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No hunting for souvenirs today. Aussies and Kiwis on previous visits had often been able to find shell cases, shrapnel and even live bullets by poking around in the topsoil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might say I was fortunate enough to have done that with my wife when I visited the area in January. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too risky today. One of the hazards the firemen faced had been explosions going off all over the Anzac area as 79-year-old bullets and shells lying just beneath the surface ignited in the intense heat.</PARA>

Five soldiers and three fire watchmen are still unaccounted for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia and New Zealand too the event touches a nerve in the national consciousness, with memories of the Sydney fire still vivid in people's memories as the Gallipoli National Park is a resting place of thousands of Anzacs who lost their lives amongst the scrub-covered ridges and valleys during that ill-fated misadventure of 1915.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the day following the outbreak of the fire (26/7) the staff of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, responsible for the upkeep of memorials on the peninsula, raced over to try and save the Anzac complex, as they call it, consisting of wooden hut accommodation for visiting dignitaries, nurseries and a stonemason's yard. There they battled all day alongside the soldiers to save the complex from the flames advancing on it from three directions. As the fire neared they were forced to put on stonemasons' face masks and take refuge from the smoke in the sea just a few metres away. When it was clear the huts were out of danger the Commission staff, headed by Englishman John Price, who had only just taken over the post of Local Supervisor in April, made their way further north up the coastal road to inquire about the safety of the residents of several summer houses near the water's edge. They appeared safe but combustible household items were dragged into the sea as a precaution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So unpredictable was the fire however that, advancing from several different directions at the same time, some of those same houses were later engulfed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possibly some of the worst damage to Anzac memorials occurred in this area where a cluster of cemeteries marked the northern limit of what is known as `Old Anzac', manned in particular by the New Zealanders until the landings in Suvla Bay on August 6 1915 when the Anzac front line was extended to incorporate that area. `Canterbury', `No. 2 Outpost' and `New Zealand No. 2 Outpost' were all burnt though there was no structural damage. Throughout nearly the whole of Anzac however the robust stone walls (ha ha walls) and gulleys to channel away rainwater seemed to have minimalised damage to the cemeteries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout that Tuesday, nothing was certain. 40 dozers, 80 fire engines, 60 graders and more than 100 various other vehicles joined in trying to prevent the flames spreading as the fire advanced on many fronts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates of the area burnt in the previous week in the Kilit Bahir fires vary between 200 and 350 hectares.</PARA>

By 1998-99 tourism in the territory is expected to employ more than 12,000 people, generate more than $790 million, and attract some 1 1/4 million visitors a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the new five-year <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory Tourism Development Masterplan</EMPHASIS> comes at an important time in the development of territory tourism. The masterplan, which was launched by the Northern Territory Minister for Tourism, Mr Barry Coulter, in May of this year, establishes a framework for government and industry decision making through to the year 1999. It sets directions for the development of facilities and services and lays the foundation for a more vigorous and diverse industry that will extend its benefits throughout the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the foreword, Minister Coulter describes the release of the masterplan as heralding an important stage in, and maturing of, the Northern Territory tourism industry. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document establishes that the Territory must capitalise on its natural assets, represented through an extensive National Parks network, and its rich heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It puts forward plans to cater for increasing numbers of visitors seeking an exposure to nature and keen to experience the character of the outback.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so, it encourages industry investment in developing both new and higher quality amenities, to a product and services in concert with Government initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The masterplan calls on the territory to capitalise on its natural resources and, not surprisingly, it highlights the importance of parks and reserves to territory tourism. It goes a step further, recommending that Kakadu and Uluru national parks be brought under territory control, to `ensure a coordinated approach to management, marketing, planning and expansion.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly attracted to the section of the masterplan document entitled `Aboriginal cultural tourism'. This sets out a number of very important aspects and issues that affect Aboriginal people, in particular the aims of Aboriginal cultural tourism. They are to encourage Aboriginal people to become involved with tourism in the Northern Territory by sharing their vibrant culture with interested visitors; to ensure that Aboriginal people enter the tourism market at their own pace and survive in the market; to ensure high quality experiences for people interested in Aboriginal cultural tourism; and to capitalise on the growing global interest in indigenous cultures. </PARA>

The tyranny of distance, for example, means a greater role for government in transport development. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory Tourism Development Masterplan</EMPHASIS> is evidence of the successful partnership between government and the private sector in the territory.

The difference between what is coming in communications in the future and what is there now is akin to an old, two-lane country road being compared to one of the LA freeways I was driving on with about 12 lanes of traffic in different directions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential of the roll-out in Australia of the optic fibre network is enormous. Currently we have our two major communication companies, Telecom and Optus, rolling this out at a very rapid rate. We will have much more information in this country available as a result. We will have better computer links within the country and with countries overseas, particularly into the system known as Internet. This is the interconnection in America of 30,000 different computer networks. Australia is now linked into that and is the fourth largest user in the world of that system. So we are well placed, not only for computers, but for more faxes, TV signals, radio signals and interactive television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are industries and products that exist at the moment. The great thing about what is coming with the information superhighway is the way in which it opens up a whole range of new services and the construction of a new set of industries. Given the level of unemployment in this country at this time, it opens up new hope for the development of new businesses and new employment, provided Australia is properly placed to take advantage of this new age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as interactive television where people can participate in game shows for entertainment, we will be able to do our shopping from home. We will be able to bank from home. Another application which will generate enormous interest in the city of Los Angeles where people are clogged up on the expressways is telecommuting. With this new technology, people can actually do a lot of their work from home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just think of the implications if, all of a sudden, people can stay at home in the suburbs and do their work. If they are in rural and regional Australia, they would not have to move to the cities to work, they could work by telecommuting from home. This has enormous implications for the structure of society, for the way we develop our cities and the way we develop our roads and expressways. Just think of the implications also for things like less pollution and less congestion and the improvement in the efficiency of the economy overall. With telecommuting, the location of businesses is no longer as important. It is a chance for Australia to get rid of what was coined by Geoffrey Blainey and called `the tyranny of distance'. It gives regions the chance to attract new business without the old disadvantage of distance being such a great problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most revolutionary change this coming new information age will bring to Australia is what can happen in the home. At the moment, we have got a copper wire going into our homes and this will bring in computing services and telephones. We can actually do some low level television with copper wire, particularly with the new ABSL technology. With the new system which combines optic fibre and coaxial cable, one can have a situation where the husband is watching football on cable television, his wife might be working on an office related task, the son could be a participant in an interactive video game and the daughter might be downloading research material from a major library to do an assignment. Another family member could be calling up a video on demand. This gets rid of going to the local video store; people can actually call up the particular video they want at the time they want with this technology. This is all on one cable. This is not very far away in Australia. What I am talking about will be here in the next five to 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great opportunity of going to America to look at what they were doing was really an opportunity to look at the way they are structuring it and, indeed, to learn some of the lessons. One of the things that struck me about America in the information age is the way in which the issues that come out of the information superhighway are a matters of very high level debate. They discuss matters such as privacy; they discuss the intellectual property rights of people. A whole series of issues about the creation of new businesses, and the proper regulatory framework to bring that about, are not yet being discussed at any great length in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, the person who is taking the lead on this in the United States, the man who is the guru of the information superhighway, is Al Gore, the Vice-President. He goes on chat shows and to all sorts of places to sell the message that there is great news for America in the development of the information superhighway and great opportunities for American business. I do not hear our own Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, saying anything like this. I do not think he is even aware of the information superhighway&mdash;and certainly Al Gore he ain't!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be much more debate in this country about this matter and a lot more pro-active involvement of government in the development of the information superhighway. In America, they are changing the regulatory structure to take into account the converging technologies in this area. What we now know as radio, as television, as a computing industry will all start to merge into one industry. What we know as a telephone, a television and a computer screen will all merge into flat screen technology. There will be the one instrument in the house, or a number of those, that will do all those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Americans are putting money into research. The government is supporting research into the development of these new products. It is setting up a series of what it calls `research test beds' across the United States to try out the applications of this technology. They are wiring up whole towns and cities just to see how people are going to use this technology. I was in Silicon Valley and one section of Silicon Valley, called Smart Valley, is being wired up. Over the other side of the country in Florida they are wiring up the whole city of Tampa. Are people going to shop from home? Are they going to demand video to the level that we think? Will they bank from home? Will they telecommute? There are billions of dollars involved in investments here. How is the market going to react? America is very advanced in having a look at how it will react. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at Australia's position in relation to this, we are very well placed. We are not debating the issues that we should be at this point, and I hope what I am saying today is one small contribution to the kick-off and continuation of that debate. But we do have a position in this country that places us well in terms of the development of the structure of this industry. The Americans are very tied up in a regulatory web that covers not only the federal level but also all states which have a say in the communication industries. We do not have the problem. We have one set of federal laws so it makes it simple. They have an enormously complex industrial structure for rolling out this information superhighway. We have Telecom and Optus that are doing this at a very rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we are well placed to build the information superhighway, we have to be sure that in the end we do not have an information superhighway that has no Australian traffic on it, that it could be all American traffic. If that is the case, they will make a lot of money out of it and we will not. That has all sorts of implications for our economic growth, for our jobs and for our foreign exchange. The potential is there for Australia to create a whole range of new industries to put on the information superhighway. I can give you one example: home publishing. If you have ever published a book, you will find 90 per cent of the profit goes to the publishing company. The information superhighway provides the opportunities for you to set up and publish books from home, put it on the information superhighway. For someone ordering your book, it can be actually downloaded in the store, printed in the store. To give you an example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gone with the Wind</EMPHASIS> can be printed in 10 minutes under this system, bound and handed to you. But that is only just one industry; there is a whole range of industries. </PARA>

Could the minister explain how an organisation such as ANL has lost up to $290 million in value in the last 12 months?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that at this point any such assumption as the one that has just been made in that question can be made. The fact is&mdash;and the Senate has been advised of this over the last few years and, I might also add, has been in receipt of the audited accounts&mdash;that the financial results of ANL have not been good. That piece of information has been available not only to me but to every other senator in this chamber. It is a fact as evidenced by the losses that have been accurately published in the press. Those losses have been properly reflected in the company's audited annual accounts that are public documents&mdash;accounts, I might add, that are audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suppose that Senator Gibson reads the trade papers but, as well as that public information in the company's accounts disclosing those losses, there has been widespread publicity in the maritime trade papers over a period of years now about the difficult performance of ANL. What should be pointed out to Senator Gibson and what he should be aware of is that when the government inherited this company in 1982 and Mr Morris became the minister&mdash;this is also a matter on the public record&mdash;the company was then in a hopeless financial position. It was hundreds of millions of dollars on the wrong side of the ledger. In addition, it had a fleet of 33 decrepit ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of a decade the government installed a new board, which drastically restructured the company, and downsized and re-equipped its fleet from the 33 ships that existed in 1982. In 1982 the company was hopelessly bankrupt. As I advised the Senate, not just yesterday but on many previous occasions, in shipping terms there was not a recession internationally but a depression in the 1990s in world shipping. Because of the downturn in trade, shipping, as I advised the Senate at the time, was one of the industries that copped the downturn first. In the core trades in which ANL has been operating&mdash;that is, the European trade and the North East Asian and South East Asian trades&mdash;the competition has been fierce. The margins have not just simply been low but there have been no margins in terms of the freight rates that are being offered because of the significant surplus of shipping internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the restructuring of the company that this government engaged upon&mdash;we wanted to see a future for both it and its employees, as distinct from what the opposition wanted&mdash;that period in the 1990s was in fact an internationally depressed time for the entire international shipping industry, and those losses continued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I advised the Senate yesterday, those losses have escalated sharply in the last 12 months. Indeed, $18 million of the projected $25 million loss for this financial year has occurred in the last six months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Prime Minister travelled to Dubbo today and took the opportunity to announce this government's ongoing commitment to landcare. Despite the derisory comments of the opposition, I add that the rural community appreciates this, even if Senator Panizza does not. I believe the announcement demonstrates the importance we place on this vital program. An all-out effort to halt and reverse the degradation of our land and water resources remains one of the key tenets of Labor's rural and environmental policy strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's overall landcare funding from my portfolio and Senator Faulkner's is in excess of $110 million for 1994-95.

These moneys include funding of $72.95 million for new and continuing projects under the land and water elements of the national landcare program. Funding to meet the growth in community landcare groups remains a priority. Allocations to the community component of the program total $15.3 million. The number of community-based landcare groups in both rural and urban areas has grown from 75 in 1985 to more than 2,200 today. This represents a clear commitment from the community to tackle natural resource degradation.</PARA>

Why in 1990 did the minister claim that ANL `continues to perform as a profit-making, tax and dividend paying business. It is indicative of the hard-nosed, commercial approach that the Government has been promoting'? Is it not a fact that during the four years that Senator Collins was the minister for shipping and the minister for transport, ANL's performance dramatically declined? In fact, over the last two years, when he was minister for three-quarters of that period, the value of ANL declined by up to $290 million. Why was it not Senator Collins instead of Mr Brereton who had to get out and warn of the catastrophic deterioration in the shipping line, and why did he not implement the type of drastic action that the government has now been belatedly forced to take after the horse has bolted?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Alston wants a history lesson, which he has just embarked upon, he might like to have a look at the full history of this company. In 1982 this government inherited a shipping line which had 33 decrepit ships&mdash;Senator Alston is talking about deteriorating performance&mdash;and was hopelessly bankrupt; its financial position was hopeless. This government embarked simultaneously on not simply a total restructuring of the company and a drastic downsizing and re-equipping of the fleet from the decrepit condition in which Senator Alston's predecessors left it, but a very ambitious and, I might add, successful program of both shipping and waterfront reform in which ANL played a key role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been acknowledged in this chamber by me and Senator Cook that ANL was an absolute key reform implementer in both shipping and waterfront reform over that very difficult period. Under the stewardship of this government, the company dramatically improved the position it was in, hoping that it would be well positioned in the 1990s, with a pick-up in the international economy, to profit from those radical restructurings. I might add that not only were the ships downsized but simultaneously there was a drastic reduction in the crew sizes on those ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably&mdash;and this is a matter of public record in the Senate and everywhere else&mdash;because of what was an international depression in terms of the downturn in trade, one of the industries that copped it hardest, for obvious reasons, was the shipping industry. As I told the Senate yesterday, and as I have previously advised the Senate, ANL was far from being alone in this. The international liner trade provides 70 per cent of the core business of ANL. Almost every shipping company in the world far larger than ANL was copping significant losses over the same period. But those companies were in a better position to sustain those losses than was a small company like ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the company's losses are a matter of record in its audited accounts. Senator Alston has access to them. The fact that the company has been operating poorly is a matter of some regret, but it is wrong to say that nothing was done over that period&mdash;quite the reverse, as the record will show. Government announcements from 1991 until now have indicated the progressive changes that have been made to ANL by this government in the hope that the international shipping situation would have improved sufficiently for the company, restructured as it has been, to take advantage of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of public record. I was responsible for negotiating the changes to provide for a 49 per cent sell down in 1991 and we have progressively moved to the position of a 100 per cent sell down now. The scoping study that was implemented as a result of that responsible government decision has resulted in the position that we now have with the appointment of a new board and the six-month plan to restructure this company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the record. It has been one of careful and responsible stewardship by this government in an attempt to maintain a viable industry. Regrettably, not only has that situation not improved but also the assessment that has been made in the last month or so is that the prospects are not going to improve in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most senators&mdash;certainly Senator Chris Evans and government senators&mdash;would know that EMDG and ITES are central components of government-funded assistance measures targeted at the business sector and, with regard to EMDG, most particularly to the small to medium sized business sector. They have been reviewed consistently, and consistently been found to be efficient and effective. Each time they are reviewed there are suggestions about how the administration might be tidied up in minor ways and those things are done, as they will be again as a result of this review, but overall they continue to say that the schemes are worthy of continuation and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent evaluation was an independent evaluation conducted by, amongst others, Price Waterhouse with the assistance of Professor Bulley, econometrician and head of the Department of Economics at the University of New South Wales. They concluded that the schemes are effective in assisting Australian businesses&mdash;and, in the case of EMDG, as I said, particularly small to medium businesses&mdash;to export. That is important for those businesses. It is important for jobs that are created in those businesses and for the flow-on effect to our balance of payments and to other employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of EMDG, over 70 per cent of the 3,000-plus claimants in 1993-94 were small to medium businesses. The report assessed that, of those claimants, those who are mature exporters generate 15 to 25 times the grants paid in export income as a result of the grant. That is certainly good news in terms of the balance of payments and, most importantly, jobs. In relation to those claimants, on the basis of this assessment it can be established that exporting activity accounts for 50 per cent of their jobs and 50 per cent of their investment. It seems on that basis to be a niche that needs to be filled and a role that deserves to be played.</PARA>

In particular, I draw attention to the reported remarks of Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister Sir Julius Chan regarding the possibility of renewed discussions with the Bougainvillean interlocutors.

Does Australia remain firmly committed to a resolution through peace talks and a political settlement?</PARA></TALK.START>

To date, there has been no significant challenge to their presence, although that cannot be assumed to continue to be the case in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that the PNGDF has a legitimate and useful role to play on Bougainville, a point that was acknowledged in the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which, under Senator Loosley's chairmanship, visited Bougainville in April this year.

It is our hope that this action by the PNGDF will not stall the process of dialogue that is now under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to believe that it will stall that process. Prime Minister Wingti, with whom I discussed the matter at the South Pacific Forum in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago, said that he remained firmly committed to pursuing a process of dialogue with Bougainvilleans. In a recent press statement following the Panguna operation, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Chan reiterated this position by stating that the Bougainville crisis could not be solved by military means alone. He said that the government was still fully committed to ending the suffering and destruction on Bougainville through the concerted process which began in June for a peace settlement between all concerned Bougainvillean groups and the national government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Formal discussions between the Papua New Guinea government and the Bougainvillean groups have not taken place since the end of June. Nonetheless, informal discussions have continued between various Bougainvillean factions and PNG officials. Senior BRA members have not so far responded to PNG government overtures for talks. We believe it is now imperative that the BRA join the PNG government in establishing a framework for the resolution of the conflict, hopefully perhaps, involving some assistance from the government in Honiara, as was suggested in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is axiomatic that responsibility for ending this conflict does rest ultimately with the parties themselves. There are some useful and appropriate ways in which Papua New Guinea's friends can assist in this context. We do believe, for example, that the visit of the parliamentary delegation&mdash;to which I have referred&mdash;has assisted in bringing about a climate in which a process of dialogue has at least been able to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also welcome the evidence that the Papua New Guinea government has taken up a couple of specific recommendations of that report. Prime Minister Wingti visited Bougainville, as had been recommended, on 26 July and subsequently pledged additional reconstruction funds. He also announced a decision more recently to establish a human rights commission. Flowing from that, a workshop has been organised for later this year with the assistance of the UN Development Program and Centre for Human Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain ready as an Australian government to play a supportive role in facilitating a peaceful resolution there, provided that all parties agree that Australia's assistance would be helpful. To this end, for example, we recently provided the Solomon Islands government with a small cash assistance to enable it to facilitate peace talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have indicated that we may be prepared to assist a peacekeeping operation on Bougainville&mdash;that is a Pacific Island formed peacekeeping operation&mdash;provided there is sufficient progress in the PNG government's dialogue with its Bougainvillean interlocutors. Any such operation would need to be of a limited duration and have a clear and tightly defined mission&mdash;for example, to provide security for a peace and reconciliation conference. We certainly would not envisage, as I have said publicly before, the deployment of significant Australian Defence Force elements on the ground in any such operation. No specific request has been put to us, however, at this stage.</PARA>

We have examined it and we, as a government, will make a response to it announcing what we propose to do, in view of its recommendations, probably in September.</PARA>

Across the whole range of state-provided services consumers stand to gain a huge amount, but the states have performed, I think, in a less than adequate way in that inquiry. That is a big area of savings too in addition to this area.</PARA>

<PARA>Throughout the past 10 years ANL has been a disaster. Despite the fact that there has been a significant board shake-up in earlier years and a capital injection by the taxpayer of $160 million, it has failed to be competitive. ANL has never been internationally competitive, and it has accumulated enormous losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the accounts of ANL which show that in 1991-92 there were losses of $9 million; in 1992-93 there were losses of $8 million, and paper reports indicate that the indicative losses for this last year will be $24 million. We believe that ANL management has forecast losses of more than $50 million for the next three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you; I will be pleased to receive it. But let me point out to the Senate that on 30 June last year, just over 12 months ago, the balance sheet indicated the value of ANL was $158 million. Yet, according to the Salomon Brothers-Price Waterhouse report ANL has a current net worth of minus $75 million to minus $118 million. So in just over 12 months we have had a deterioration in the net value of up to $276 million. That is an enormous change&mdash;an absolutely enormous, disgraceful change&mdash;in just over 12 months, and this parliament deserves a detailed explanation as to how this could possibly have taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the reason for this enormous decline in value is obviously sheeted home to the government. It was reported in April this year that ANL management had written to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) outlining a number of concerns it had about the way in which the government's asset sales task force was handling the sale conditions. One of the  concerns was that the board was forced to scrap the business rationalisation plans and that the government's interference was having a detrimental impact on ANL's relationship with its financiers. It is obvious that the minister did nothing to allay the fears of the previous board. Parliament deserves a full explanation of this appalling fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really points out that ANL has not been internationally competitive. The government should go on to explain not only how this mess came about but also what it is going to do about the shipping industry. The starting point for that is the recommendations recently given to the minister by the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. The virtual destruction of ANL, which we have had demonstrated to us this week, proves that governments cannot and should not get involved in businesses.

I think the audit was conducted in September or October last year and the government received a letter from the Auditor-General clearing the accounts of ANL&mdash;an unqualified clearance of the accounts&mdash;as being a true and accurate record of the financial position of the company. Those accounts disclose, as Senator Alston correctly said, a net asset value of $157.6 million. This is an accounting book value and has been noted in the due diligence evaluation by Price Waterhouse. These accounting based values bear no resemblance at all to an estimate of the market sale value assessed by the due diligence process. </PARA>

Those figures were audited by the Australian National Audit Office, and the Auditor-General provided the government with a completely unqualified audit clearance in December last year. So that is the reason for that difference in the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That scoping study commissioned in 1992, which was part of the progressive movement that the government made on ANL over the last three years because of the deteriorating position of the company, did have a very wide ambit of values from both positive to significantly negative. The reason, quite simply, was that it was based on a whole range of different assumptions that could be made on a potential sale. The ANL company, like most other shipping companies, has a complex arrangement of joint ventures on particular trades, and stevedoring as well. The assumptions made on sale are based on the possible permutations of variations of that sale or sell-off, whichever is decided upon in the end, or a combination of both. And Senator Alston is quite correct when he says that the scoping study provided a very wide range of positive to negative values in 1992; but his claim that the company lost $290 million is just absolutely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That figure takes the high value of the 1992 scoping study valuation range and compares it with the low value of the much more precise 1994 due diligence process. It is simply an absolutely flawed way of comparing the figures. The more precise 1994 due diligence valuation falls within the range of the 1992 scoping study. It is in large measure, as I have already advised the Senate, the result of the dramatic deterioration in ANL shipping trade since January 1994, which in the consultant's opinion&mdash;and the minister has made this clear&mdash;made any sale of ANL at that time unrealistic and necessitated a valuation based on a market value sale of the assets, which the government has determined it will at this time not do. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Yet at the same time, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has sacked the board responsible. Why? Was it because something was wrong? Did it take the minister four years to work out something was wrong? Or was it due to totally outside factors such as an investigation by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers that eventually brought it to the attention of this dynamic, alert, intelligent minister, who has his finger on every button but is pressing `off' instead of `on'? This enormously energetic minister did not know the problems. He thought everything was wonderful.

<PARA>It is trite and often said that the noisier and the more belittling the response the more one can be assured that one's opponent has no logical principle on his side when trying to engage in debate. The very interesting point made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) in his answer was that the UN decision in relation to Tasmania's criminal laws was of only an advisory nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, I defy the government to go to the High Court of this country and assert that it does not have an international obligation to implement that decision because it is only advisory. Let the government say that to the High Court of Australia. Under the external affairs power that the government is seeking to rely on, it should really be asserting that it has an international obligation. But the interesting thing is that the Labor Party is now walking away from the comments of its former guru and leader, Gough Whitlam, who said it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . entirely anomalous and archaic for Australian citizens to litigate their differences in another country before judges appointed by the government of that other country.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Government in the Senate asserted that this was somehow different, that this was not real litigation. It was not real litigation in respect of the way that the United Nations conducted the hearing because every fundamental of natural justice was absolutely and utterly denied. There were hearings in private, with no right to cross-examination, and the Tasmanian point of view was not able to be put. The important point in this debate is summarised by another ex-Labor minister, Peter Walsh, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not and never have been a monarchist, but I find it ironic that so many contemporary Australians, determined to protect us from the non-existent threat of English tyranny, fall over each other in a scramble to surrender Australian sovereignty to a ragtag and bobtail of unrepresentative United Nations committees accountable to nobody.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Tasmanian laws, the question is not whether the laws are right, wrong or indifferent, the question is: who ought to make that decision? What we are in fact debating is a question of morality. It is just as much a question of morality to impose a law as it is to repeal a law because we have got to make a moral judgment. When we have got to make a moral judgment&mdash;and the Democrats seem to be having difficulty in dealing with the question of moral judgment&mdash;there will always be a conflicting point of view presented within the community. There will be those in favour of repeal and those against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question has to be asked: who is to make the final decision in relation to that moral judgment? I make no apology for saying that it is the people of each individual state who ought to make that determination through the ballot box, through the democratic processes. The Australian Democrats are chirping away, as they always do. The simple fact is they cannot come to grips with a fundamental issue&mdash;that is, whether or not they believe in democracy as to whether or not the people of Australia are going to be the final determiners of their laws and the rules that apply. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if we were to have asked the question when the first state repealed certain laws, that state was out of step with much of the rest of the world and with every other state in Australia. We should not have had federal intervention then. If it is perceived that Tasmania is out of step, I say: so what? Let the people of Tasmania determine that through their democratic processes. Whilst the Labor government continues to apologise to the United Nations and people like Gough Whitlam and Peter Walsh can be quoted against it, I am sure the people of Australia more and more will support the principled stand taken by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to maintain the named three mine policy with respect to uranium mining.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want any person listening to this debate to be misled into thinking that the Australian Democrats support uranium mining or any part of the nuclear fuel or nuclear weapons cycles. We do not support any of these things. However, we have in Australia a three-mine policy relating to specific mines. That is government policy as well as being the policy of the governing party. This motion is urgent because pressure is building in some quarters to change that policy to allow more mines or to have a totally open slather on uranium mining. Clearly, if one supports a no mines policy as we do, one would prefer a three mines policy to a six or 10 mines policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why the Democrats have always opposed all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle are as valid or more valid today as they were when our policy on uranium mining was first adopted in 1977. There remain unresolved problems in the handling of nuclear waste and related problems in decommissioning nuclear power stations. Both Britain and France have shut nuclear power stations, and the general thinking is that these decommissioned stations will remain untouched for between 50 and 100 years before the process of dismantling begins. This is to allow the short half-life and very intense radioactivity to decay to a point at which the dismantling can begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the world some 60 nuclear power stations will achieve the end of their 30-year life by or before the year 2000. The costs of this dismantling have been put at between 50 and 100 per cent of the initial construction costs. This was probably one of the reasons why, when the CEGB in Great Britain attempted to sell power stations in that country, there was no interest in the privatisation of nuclear power plants and they remain in government ownership. It may also explain why in the US, the home of free and market driven economics, there is little interest from the electricity utilities in building more nuclear power stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the claims of nuclear safeguards, it is clear that diversion into weapons and to criminal elements cannot be prevented. We have seen examples in Iraq and North Korea where both countries were able to successfully thumb their noses at the international safeguard mechanisms. Indeed, the Middle East war would almost certainly have been nuclear if Iran had not fallen to Islamic fundamentalism some years earlier and, in doing so, cut itself off from French and German help in building nuclear reactors and reprocessors in that country. We have avoided some nuclear wars as much by good luck as by good safeguard management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days we have heard authenticated accounts of attempts to sell highly enriched uranium and plutonium from former USSR countries on the black market. It does not require very much imagination to foresee the consequences to a city like Sydney or any other major city in the world of either an actual and real nuclear threat from a criminal group or even a credible threat from such a group. It is not a matter of whether such a threat will eventuate but simply when. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the threat of nuclear accidents. I have referred previously in this chamber to the article by the Deputy Director of Nuclear Safety with the International Atomic Energy Agency in which, several months before the Chernobyl accident, he praised the inherent safety of the RBMK 1000 reactor saying that it was impossible that such an accident as that meltdown could occur. Reputable estimates of the number of extra cancers which will eventuate throughout Europe as a consequence of the Chernobyl accident puts that number at one million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For all these reasons of global and individual safety, the Democrats hold a strong position of opposition to the nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons industries. But there are other powerful economic arguments as to why we should not expand the mining of uranium; namely, that it would not be profitable to Australia to expand its uranium mines. The opposition will almost certainly argue that that decision should be left to market forces. But these decisions involve the investment of billions of dollars, dollars which will come by some route or other from ordinary Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A failed mine therefore represents a diversion of large amounts of capital that could have been used for other purposes. For example, Western Mining is contemplating the expansion of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia at a cost of $1 billion; 300 extra jobs will be created, it is claimed. These jobs will cost $3 million each. That is no solution to the problem of one million unemployed in Australia. Governments do have a responsibility in these matters but, as I will show in a moment, the sale price of uranium at present and in the foreseeable future is lower than the cost of production in Australia, and uranium mines around the world, almost without exception, are working at partial capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible&mdash;and this is a very important point&mdash;to insist on stringent safeguards in a strong buyers market. The more uranium Australia makes available, the lower the unit price and the more we will help to maintain that buyers market. Therefore, we will be tending to undermine any safeguards assurance. Buyers will go elsewhere where the safeguards are less stringent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry in Australia, in which producers have competed in limited markets, has seen lower and lower effective unit prices. The Ranger inquiry in 1977 set out the reasons for sequential development of mines. Its arguments were at the time accepted by the then government, and those reasons remain valid today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuclear industry has been consistently over-optimistic in its prediction of nuclear power expansion and the opportunities for the sale of more Australian uranium at a higher price. These predictions have been shown repeatedly to be wrong. At the start of mining in Australia, we set a floor price of $30 per pound. After a number of years that floor price had to be scrapped. The government had to scrap that floor price. In June 1994 the spot price was $9.20 to $9.30 per pound for non-communist uranium and $7 to $7.20 for material from CIS countries. According to Industry Commission report No. 7, production costs from Ranger are $15 per pound; $15 to $20 per pound from Roxby Downs; $20 to $25 from Koongarra; and $25 to $30 from Jabiluka. It is for these reasons that Ranger is working at only part capacity and is filling about 30 per cent of its sales with uranium bought under a five-year contract with Kazakhstan, which is in one of the CIS countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term demand for uranium will be and is already being heavily influenced by the sale of highly enriched uranium from CIS and US stockpiles under disarmament treaties. According to Nuexco, the international uranium marketing body, this material will begin to enter the market this year and continue for the next 20 years. If all the material under the US-Russian arms reduction treaty is released, all reactor consumption up to the year 2010 will be met without any uranium being mined anywhere in the world. This is at current rates of consumption which, it can be shown, are unlikely to rise and may well fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of new reactors coming on line has slowed. Much has been made by nuclear enthusiasts of projections which include plans rather than firm orders. For example, while 54 new reactors may reach completion or be completed by the year 2000, 60 reactors will have reached the end of their useful life and will be decommissioned. I think there are compelling reasons why this motion should be accepted by the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

He should be in Victoria winning gold for Australia in the diving pool by doing a quadruple backflip with pike and double twist. This really is the most extraordinary backflip that I have seen in the Senate. Nothing would prevent Senator Coulter from reiterating the motion he moved three months ago. </PARA>

Roxby Downs, a South Australian uranium mine which is permitted to operate under the government's policy that he is calling on us to support this afternoon, has a 200-year lifespan. So, in complete contradiction to the motion Senator Coulter moved just three months ago, his motion today is calling on the government&mdash;and we will support it&mdash;to maintain uranium mining for export from his home state of South Australia for the next 200 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Northern Land Council Director, Darryl Pearce, has criticised the three mines policy for compromising Aboriginal self-determination. Let me quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must now face that the world order has changed. The Cold War is gone. There is a new world vision I guess in terms of resources that are required to power the planet into the 21st century and uranium does have a high profile in that area.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal interest groups are maintaining pressure on key Labor figures and their factions. On a recent visit to the Northern Territory, the federal environment minister, Senator Faulkner, who is not here to participate in today's debate, met with the Gagudju Association at Cooinda to receive its pro-development message. It would be very interesting to know what was said at that meeting. It would have been very interesting for Senator Faulkner, from the Left, to have reported to us, rather than having to rely on the messages that come from the flies on the wall. There will be visits here by Aboriginal people in the next few weeks. I hope the Labor Party and the Democrats take note of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gagudju Association, set up in 1979 on behalf of the traditional owners of the Ranger project areas, is without doubt one of the Aboriginal success stories in the Northern Territory. Charged with administering agreements and royalty moneys from mining at Ranger, one of the present mines, Gagudju investments include tourist ventures, mechanical and civil engineering workshops, a construction business and a trust to safeguard children's payments. They are on about jobs and the involvement of Aborigines and territorians in this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet under Labor's three-mine uranium policy, these and many other benefits of mining are being denied to the Aboriginal communities that want them. In the words of the Northern Land Council, Labor is living a lie. Let us remember that the wishes of Aboriginal people were considered paramount by Labor, and by Senator Collins in particular, in the Coronation Hill debate; but they are conveniently not so paramount now in this Aboriginal debate. This is very similar to Aboriginal affairs minister Tickner and the Prime Minister ignoring the recommendations of the Industry Commission report and the conference of representative groups in Yulara in 1992, and a cabinet submission of January 1993 that has never seen the light of day on legislation needed to correct anomalies in the Northern Territory land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core of the hypocrisy in this issue was highlighted by the left-wing Northern Territory federal member, Warren Snowdon, who told ABC radio that Aboriginal views were only one factor in the uranium debate. He added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's not a question just of saying the traditional owners have the right to make a determination, they certainly have that right. But the nation has a responsibility where the national interest is concerned to say whether it wants, that is the nation, wants further uranium mined.</PARA>
<PARA>That might be the view of Mr Snowdon and of Senator Coulter, but it is not the view of these Aboriginal people or of the majority of Australians. The question is: does the Labor Party really respect the views of Aboriginal people, or does it respect Aboriginal views only when they happen to agree with party platform? Certainly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has taken a prominent role in the uranium debate so far and frequently refers to his record of the past 16 years. Apart from the fact that he has achieved nothing in those 16 years, it is interesting to note his dramatic turnabout from staunchly anti-uranium in 1982 to staunchly pro-uranium in 1994. Back in 1982, at the ALP national conference, he told delegates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . my credentials in respect of an anti-uranium position are impeccable, because I have led the fight against uranium in the Northern Territory now for five years. That is a fact. I have no qualms about that position.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the transcript, he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have got no doubts that I can go back to the Northern Territory which has got an 82% vote in favour of uranium mining&mdash;but I am happy to work with that, my position is well known up there as an anti-uranium person.</PARA>
<PARA>Still on hypocrisy, I remind the Senate of Australia's decision to lift sanctions on the uranium-rich South Africa, thereby allowing South Africa, along with Canada, to compete against us in world markets. Is it not absurd to lift restrictions on another country, yet retain restrictions on our own? Why do we want to hand over export dollars to the rest of the world? Is our uranium industry not good enough, or is it a case of Labor mates doing deals behind cabinet doors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ALP can be accused of hypocrisy, I issue the same warning to the Australian Democrats, in particular to Senator Kernot. If this motion of Senator Coulter's proceeds, Senator Kernot will have no option but to resign from her position on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The motion before the Senate effectively denies Aboriginal people the right to develop their land and gain economic independence. That makes a mockery of Democrat calls for Aboriginal self-determination. The importance of mining to all Australians cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the national level, mining contributes to government revenue and GDP; on the local level, benefits flow through to a range of industries; and on a personal level, it creates job opportunities and enhances superannuation investments. I say to Senator Margetts that yes, it is about jobs, jobs, jobs&mdash;and that is fundamental to all Australians. Just about every Australian family has a financial stake in this matter. Through their superannuation, all Australian families have investments in mining, and in uranium in particular, and they should be able to exploit that for their future retirement potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example. In today's money terms, just one mine&mdash;Ranger in the Northern Territory&mdash;has contributed the equivalent of $5.3 billion to the national economy; it has paid $86 million in royalties to the Northern Territory government; and it has accounted for seven per cent of the Northern Territory's economic activity. With demand for uranium ore strengthening, Australia cannot afford to waste even more export income and job opportunities. It is estimated that the development of three additional mines&mdash;Ranger North and Koongarra in the Northern Territory, and Kintyre in Western Australia&mdash;will provide export income of around $235 million a year, 1,270 jobs during construction and 520 long-term jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition policy on this issue has always been clear and unequivocal. We have always said that it is a stupid three-mine uranium policy. I, like Senator Collins, share the amazement at the fact that today the Democrats have obviously shifted from a no-uranium position and policy to a three-mine policy. I question what deal they have done behind the dunny door to get a third one up and running. Is this another deal with Labor behind some deal that will give a reward, and will there be some payola? I think we need to look at this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, and the Australian Labor Party in particular, must grasp the opportunity now. Labor's policy conference in September will give that opportunity. This debate needs strong leadership and strong support; it does not need the sort of lunatic position that has been taken and that denies the opportunity for Australian families to participate fully in jobs, in investment and&mdash;yes&mdash;in mining. </PARA>

That is our policy, but I will move as a matter of urgency that there is a need for the government to maintain the named three-mine policy with respect to uranium mining.' So we have moved rather quickly, as Senator Collins said, from a position where the Australian Democrats wanted to abandon the three-mine policy, as Senator Coulter calls it, to a position where there is now a need for the government to maintain it.</PARA>

I will enlighten Senator Ian Macdonald as to what the policy deals with. It refers particularly to the health and safety issues associated with the nuclear industry and with uranium mining. It is a policy that deals comprehensively with the fact that the nuclear industry has a peaceful and beneficial side as well as a potentially destructive side. The policy deals with the fact that Australia has existing contracts to fulfil regarding the delivery of uranium to overseas purchasers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy highlights the leading role that Australia has and will continue to play in ensuring the safe and peaceful use of uranium throughout the world. The policy deals with the way in which the responsible mining and export of uranium can contribute towards improved nuclear non-proliferation policies and practices internationally, and towards resolving the problems of high level nuclear waste management. So this is not simply a one-line three-mine policy, which seems to be what people continue to focus on when they debate this issue.

The fact that there are differing opinions within the Labor Party and within the wider community regarding uranium policy is clear. It is on the record and, as Senator Collins said, it has been on the record for a long time. But the difference is that we in the Labor Party do not try to hide behind our occasional differences of opinion. We know how to debate them so as to resolve them in the proper forums. We will be having a public conference where delegates with a broad cross-section of views will thrash out the issues. Differences of opinion within the ALP are not seen as insidious threats, as they are seen by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processes that we adopt are in stark contrast to those of the opposition and, it appears, the Democrats. Let us look at what has happened with policy development in more recent times with the opposition. We have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) dictating policy on matters one day and reversing that policy the next. We have shadow ministers running around the country contradicting each other. On citizen initiated referenda, the Leader of the Opposition disowned his own earlier views and claimed that he did not really mean what he said but that he wanted to avoid a split. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Aboriginal affairs, which Senator Tambling has referred to, the policy was reversed within 24 hours by the opposition leader. The shadow minister for health, when talking about tobacco advertising and health issues, executed more backflips, to repeat Senator Collins's analogy, than a Commonwealth games diver. When we get to that other vital issue of community debate, the republic, we see that the New South Wales Liberal Party heavies will not even allow its own members to debate the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite get up in this parliament and talk to us about policy development. The position is very clear.

Any change is a matter for the Labor Party at its forthcoming conference. That is where it will be debated and that is where it will be determined.

We have the hypocrisy of a party that a couple of decades ago was all gung-ho for mining uranium. Today it is all over the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to look at some of the descriptions of the ALP's three mines policy.

Another important person described it as `illogical'. Yet another says, `I am an advocate for change.' Another one says, `My position is that we should either be in the uranium business or we should not be in it&mdash;not halfway.' Another of these prominent Australians calls the policy `absurd'.

Another one says, `It is out of step with the opinion of international socialists.' Another one says, `It is a nonsense of a policy.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who said that the three mines policy should not be taken as Holy Grail for the ALP? None other than the Labor Party Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Who said it was illogical? The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Who said, `I am an advocate for change?' Of course, it was Senator Collins, who has already spoken in the debate, upholding the existing policy. He is going to vote for the existing policy, yet he said that he is an advocate for change.

Will he vote for the policy he has called a joke or will he vote with us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who called it bullshit? Honourable senators get no prizes for that. It was the great Labor stalwart, the great icon, the one revered by all Labor people: Mr Bob Hawke, the former Prime Minister. Who said that it is out of step with the opinion of international socialists? I did not realise those opposite still worried about that, but ex-senator Graham Richardson thought that was important. Who said it is a nonsense of a policy? Senator Loosley! Again, we will be interested to see whether Senator Loosley is going to vote for the nonsense of a policy or whether he is going to vote with us. Who said it is illogical and hypocritical? Ex-senator Richardson again! Who called it an absurdity? Senator Stephen Loosley. Who said, `What we are talking about is not a logical decision?' That was a member of the AWU-FIME, one of Labor's backers who acknowledges that Labor is playing around with this for an industrial argument.

I am pleased that Senator Coulter has raised this matter of urgency for debate today because it is indeed a critical issue for this nation. Unfortunately, the decision on whether this nation eliminates the current restrictions on uranium mining and export, that is, it goes from a bad policy to a worse policy, will be made by the men&mdash;and I use that word deliberately&mdash;who pull the  strings in the ALP factional disputes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just another mining development issue. Uranium is a dangerous mineral which can be used for horribly destructive purposes and which also has enormous and yet insoluble problems associated with waste storage and disposal. The debate on this issue should examine all aspects of the nuclear cycle&mdash;from mining, to its use in nuclear reactors, to reprocessing and/or storage, and ultimately to its use in nuclear weapons. There are enormous problems associated with all aspects of the nuclear cycle&mdash;including economic, environmental, security, public health and occupational health concerns. In my brief time I will concentrate largely on the defence and security implications&mdash;although, as an economist, I cannot resist the opportunity to make some comments in passing on the economic stupidity of pursuing a nuclear option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amory Lovins from the Rocky Mountains Institute in Colorado sums up the economic arguments succinctly. On ABC radio in 1991, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Round the world, nuclear power has been dying of an incurable attack of market forces and at most, by the year 2000, it will have just a few percent of the global capacity that it was then officially predicted to have. The basic reasons for this are rather clear&mdash;the first, that it is a terribly expensive technology. In the United States, for example, nuclear power is producing only a fourth as much electricity as you could save, at only a seventh the cost of running a nuclear plant, even if building it cost nothing. And after something like half a trillion dollars of investment, our civilian nuclear sector is now producing a good deal less delivered energy than wood. I can't think of any case in history where so much has been spent by so many, for so little.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Australian context, this economic madness is also evident. Since the early 1950s, when the Australian Atomic Energy Commission commenced operations under ANSTO until recently, the Australian taxpayer has committed in excess of $2.5 billion, in 1991 dollars, on nuclear technology. That figure does not include any allowance for the decommissioning costs at Lucas Heights. The total return on that investment has been approximately $110 million. If we are talking about jobs, here are the real figures. If the renewable energy technology sector, which received less than $50 million from the Australian government over the same period, had achieved similar appalling returns on the investment, the programs would undoubtedly have been scrapped. Why are we not doing the same for the nuclear industry in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a defence perspective, there is no denying that there is a direct connection between the civilian use of nuclear power and technology and the potential for nuclear weapons. Elizabeth Clegg, from the Centre of Defence Studies of the University of Aberdeen, in an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contemporary Review</EMPHASIS> entitled `Building the bomb: how states go nuclear', recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, then, it can be seen that the infrastructure required for the development of a nuclear weapons potential is best created under cover of a well established civilian nuclear industry; in all of the above cases the military option was made possible by the existence of a civilian programme.</PARA>
<PARA>While some naive analysts may claim that the post-Cold War period has provided renewed stability in international relations, this is patently not the case, as even a cursory examination of any newspaper will confirm. In the current unstable political climate in many regions of the world, the added threat of an expanding number of nations with nuclear weapons capability is horrendous. As Elizabeth Clegg indicates, if we continue to support and supply so-called civilian nuclear operations, we are potentially adding to international nuclear weapons capacity. For the record, the Greens (WA) do not support the current three mines policy. We support a real no mines policy for uranium mining. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank annual report is once again an interesting document. It is one of the key economic documents to be released each year by the official organs of government. The Reserve Bank is the key financial institution in Australia and is the central bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains a number of interesting matters that I wish to touch on briefly today. It runs through the normal matters including its view of the economy and economic policy, and developments in the recent past; it looks at the future economy; it also deals with normal financial markets, financial intermediation and financial system surveillance as well as its own operating results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the first page of the document contains a list of the 15 interest rate cuts that were required by the government in an attempt to stimulate the Australian economy out of its prolonged recession that the government's own economic mismanagement engineered in the late 1980s and which the government and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, acknowledged as the recession we had to have, which was absolute nonsense. The only reason we had to have the long, deep, prolonged recession that we had was the fact that the government had displayed monumental incompetence in its fiscal and monetary policy management and its economic management as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this report was signed off by the Chairman of the Reserve Bank Board, the Governor of the bank, Mr Fraser, in his signing off letter to the Treasurer on 5 August, we have had a reversal of that interest rate reduction trend. We saw a three-quarters of a per cent increase in the official rate last week. I wonder whether next year's report will open by listing the rises that will occur over that period as well as having taken the credit for the reductions that have occurred in recent years. It is some time now since there was an interest rate reduction, the last one being on 30 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend has now started to reverse. The government has acknowledged that there is no doubt that interest rates are on the way up. We have seen the start of it with the Reserve Bank decision of the three-quarters of one per cent rate increase last week. There is no doubt at all that so long as the government continues on its path of fiscal policy ineptitude and excesses it is inevitable that we will see a continuing spiral in interest rates. The timing of the release of the report is ironic in the context of last week's first interest rate rise in four years, no doubt the first of many in the tightening of monetary policy under this Labor government. As my colleague Senator O'Chee has pointed out, it was a pretty hefty rise at that. Three-quarters of one per cent is a hefty rise in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains a dissertation on the domestic and international economy. It toes the government's line very closely on those matters. Which organisation is leading which is another matter&mdash;whether the government is following the Reserve Bank line or the Reserve Bank is following the government line&mdash;but there is no doubt that the two are running very closely together in their comments and analysis of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains what I would regard as some fanciful hopes in the present climate of a major pick-up in investment expenditure. It admits that investment has failed to improve under this government's policies and that investment now is at disastrously low levels without any clear indication at all that we will see any pick-up let alone any sustained pick-up in the investment expenditure in this country. The bank says in its report that it hopes there will be a pick-up, but hope is a fairly weak reed to fly with in an economic situation such as we have today, particularly in a rising interest rate climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report devotes a section to housing in an attempt to justify what must have been known when this report was produced&mdash;that there was soon going to be an increase in interest rates. Again it runs the government line on housing borrowing that, despite there being no boom in housing prices, there is too much housing activity. It seems to have ignored the most recent figures for residential housing activity which has shown a fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to a very interesting graph on page 8 of the report which shows housing affordability over the 20 years since 1975-76. Despite the government's current propaganda that housing affordability is now at its best for 20 years or more, the Reserve Bank graph shows quite clearly that that is not the case. Even though the affordability ratio has improved in the last</PARA>
<PARA>year or so, it is still nowhere near the levels attained throughout the period of the previous Fraser Liberal/National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing affordability is currently only just above the level it was when Labor came to office in 1983. In other words, housing affordability is now slightly less good than it was in 1993 and, as I have said, less so than throughout the entire period of the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes considerable note, understandably, of the commendable fall in inflation in Australia. The question of whether we have broken the inflation stick permanently, that inflation legacy that Australia inherited from the Whitlam period, is a much more open question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is particularly telling about the achievement of low inflation in Australia in the last few years is the immense cost that we have borne to attain this. It is interesting that the report does reveal the rarely admitted real GDP per capita figures for Australia's economic growth. Normally, we just see figures for GDP growth in a period without relating them to the movements in population. Of course, the GDP per capita figures much more accurately reflect living standards than the government's preferred real GDP figure which, as I say, takes no account of Australia's relatively high population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one does take account of that population growth, the Reserve Bank statistics show that the gross domestic product in Australia did not rise on a per capita basis from the late 1980s right through until 1992. Over that same period, allowing for lags, unemployment rose from just under seven per cent to a record figure of more than 11 per cent. Of course, we all know the tragedy&mdash;the fact that more than one million Australians were unemployed at a number of times during this period. Indeed, today, we still have the tragedy of almost 900,000 Australians unable to find work and at least an equal number unable to find the type or hours of work that they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to raise is the question of fiscal policy and the budget deficit. The Reserve Bank, of course, is more concerned with monetary policy; that is its responsibility. But we cannot look at monetary policy without linking it with consideration of fiscal policy. The two go hand in hand. The bank report makes only a brief mention of the budgetary situation and, in particular, the ongoing excessive budget deficit problem. On page 17 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Achieving&mdash;and hopefully doing better than&mdash;this planned reduction in the deficit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>planned by the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will have an important bearing on the level and composition of growth in the years ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an understatement, to say the least. The simple fact is that this government has been quite unable to develop a budgetary policy, a fiscal policy, which has permitted a sufficiently rapid run-down in the huge budget deficits that it has accumulated over many years. For the government to say that the best it can do is hopefully to get the budget into balance by about 1996-97 or 1997-98 is absolutely unsatisfactory and is far too lax a fiscal policy. That has huge implications for monetary policy, interest rate policy; therefore, for the level of investment and economic activity. The whole thing flows through together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing the budget deficit much more rapidly than this government is budgeting for and forecasting must be a major priority. It should also be something which the Reserve Bank, if it is really serious about sustained low inflation growth, ought to be bringing forward and speaking loudly about day in and day out until action is taken. Until this does happen, recovery will always be tenuous at best. The sustainability of economic growth that is so essential for the future of this country will be out of our reach and desperately needed investment will simply not eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the comments of the bank on this matter and the prospects for growth are shallow at the least because I believe they ignore some of the fundamental problems that the budget policy of this government leads to. It leads to increased pressure on interest rates. The government has a financing requirement this year in excess of $20 billion, a higher figure than last year. The prospects for the financing requirement over the next few years are also horrendously high. When we have a financing requirement of that nature, we are obviously putting pressure on interest rates in a way that the proper activities of a well-managed economy would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a continuing huge problem with our balance of payments situation. We have a current account deficit which year in, year out seems incapable of shrinking considerably on any sustainable basis. The current account deficit is now blowing out again and is forecast, even by the government itself, to blow out further. We all know that that is the cause of the enormous foreign debt problem that we have today. We have a foreign debt to the rest of the world that virtually exceeds that of any other country. For a country with our resources and potential, that is nothing short of disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the more significant factor, rather than just the disgrace of it, is the enormous impact it has on economic activity in Australia and the enormous impact it has on reducing our sovereign independence. We have a government and a Prime Minister who run around saying, `We're not really independent because we're a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic; we're not independent because of the flag that we've got.' We hear all of this sort of nonsense. The real damage, the real danger and the real blow to the independence of this nation has been the economic policy of this government over many years, which has seen more than a seven-fold increase in our net foreign debt to the rest of the world in the 10 or 11 years that this government has been in power. When this government came to power in March 1983, Australia's total net foreign debt to the rest of the world was $23 billion. Today, it is well in excess of $170 billion&mdash;more than a seven-fold increase. Indebtedness of that nature and of that extent automatically and inevitably reduces our independence as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the Reserve Bank report did not pick up any of these issues and make some of these points, because they are the most important points that we need to consider in any future consideration of economic policy, economic policy development and the economic management of this country. If we do not get those things right, if we do not recognise and address those fundamental problems, we are going to continue to lose our sovereign independence. We are going to continue to hobble ourselves in terms of our capacity to provide jobs, because we can only get increased jobs if we have a policy which enables the nation to save, to invest and to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are inhibiting ourselves right across the board in those fundamental areas. With regard to the whole question of competition policy, micro-economic reform has gone on the backburner. The government is saying that it cannot do any more economic reform, that it has gone as far as it can go. What absolute nonsense! It has not even started to scratch the surface of the micro-economic reform agenda that is required in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity and an indictment, I believe, of the bank that its report does not pick up sufficiently on these matters. Indeed, many of them are not mentioned at all. I trust that it will do so next year because unless it does, it is not living up to its responsibility to inform the Australian public and the government on the real issues that have to be addressed if we are going to see, into the 21st century, the type of vibrant economic nation that we obviously so desperately need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 at the second reading stage, there are basically three matters&mdash;two in particular&mdash;that I want to raise. We have asked for this bill to go to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There are two matters that we want looked at, and they are the ones that I primarily want to talk about. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee rightly identified another problem that the government may care to take up with respect to some amendments to the ASIO Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, this bill is an omnibus bill. I am not sure why it is not called the `Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill', since that is the title often attached to these sorts of omnibus bills. In any event, this bill amends 17 acts, mostly in minor, technical or consequential ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot resist mentioning the manner in which we do things and the high cost of lawyers that is passed on to their clients in chasing up these constant, minor, technical amendments&mdash;as we call them&mdash;which make ourselves feel better. Nonetheless, we are changing the law in different ways and people have to chase those changes. No doubt, this bill will be purchased by people who want it for one reason, and 17 different groups will purchase the whole bill because they want it for one reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to constantly turn our mind to that. Maybe one day we will be bright enough to use some sort of technological advance which will allow the amendments to separate bills to be put in electronic form and distributed easily, so people do not have to buy this old-fashioned paper with 17 amendments to 17 bills. Instead, they can simply go and get the details of the one they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal firstly with the one amendment to the ASIO Act that I wanted to raise as a consequence of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee having spotted this. Having served on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I should have found it myself. There is an amendment which would allow the Director-General of Security to give a standing authorisation to an officer of ASIO to approve persons to exercise the authority of warrants issued by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had consultations with the Director-General. We think it is quite sensible and not a controversial amendment. Simply, there will be occasions when the Director-General is not available to approve persons who are able to exercise authority of warrants. If he is not available it causes difficulty, and there is no reason not to fix that. Except, this is a power that up until now has laid only with the Director-General of Security. All of a sudden, we are prepared to say&mdash;simply by not thinking, I suggest&mdash;`He can give it to an officer of ASIO, any officer of ASIO.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, we have had the view that it could only be the Director-General. The intention is that he gives it to a person of a particular category or level but, as a result of what I think is a drafting oversight, it means that he can give it to any officer of ASIO. I am sure that the government did not intend that, and I feel quite confident that it will address that matter. It is just another example, of course, of the Senate scrutiny committee doing its job, picking up faults in legislation on a completely nonpartisan basis, and trying to improve legislation as it goes through them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more substantive area that I wanted to raise relates to the amendment to require a court to take cultural background into account when sentencing federal offenders, and to include cultural background as a consideration when discharging offenders without proceeding to conviction. The amendment will add cultural background to the previous list of character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the law</EMPHASIS>. My understanding is that by doing this&mdash;and the point was raised in the report&mdash;one would hope that cultural background is not used, for example, as a justification for violence against women. The Law Reform Commission concluded that we could have confidence in the courts and the manner in which they would take that into account. They do take it into account now through the common law in a number of states, at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not lack the confidence that the courts will do that properly. Nonetheless, the point was raised. There was sufficient substance in the concern for it to be mentioned. We would like the legal and constitutional affairs committee to tease out those concerns. It may be that the Law Reform Commission may have no basis for its concerns, but I suspect it would not have said something if it did not have some basis for them. It would not hurt for the committee to have a very brief look at that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I understand the concern correctly, it is not that cultural background will be taken into account when it is a relevant part of the offence. How could we be concerned at that? Some people want it taken into account in mitigation when the cultural background itself has had nothing at all to do with the offence. The degree to which that would happen might cause some concern. We need a few more informed, knowledgeable minds informing the Senate of how that would operate before we make that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that we want the Senate Staning Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to deal with relates to other amendments to the Crimes Act in the 20(2A) area. This is to ensure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that a person is not to be imprisoned for failure, under an order made under subsection 20(1), to pay an amount by way of reparation, restitution or compensation or an amount in respect of costs.</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, there are two opportunities: one is to have a non-custodial sentence, and the other is to have a custodial sentence that is suspended. This ensures that if an order is made and someone gets out of going to gaol&mdash;if that is the appropriate way to phrase it&mdash;and they then breach that order, they will not go to gaol for breaching that order but will be able to be dealt with in the same way as they could have been dealt with under the original offence. We are concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people get the benefit of some kind of positive discretion by the courts in their favour and they have this non-custodial sentence or a custodial sentence that is suspended by the making of an order&mdash;and perhaps this only relates to the first part&mdash;that then means that they do not go to gaol. In that case why are we saying, `If you breach the order, it doesn't matter; we'll just go back to treating you as though you have started once again at the beginning'&mdash;almost start de novo. If people get the benefit of some goodwill from the courts, they have an obligation to comply and ought to be dealt with severely when they do not. Goodwill only goes so far and, if people want to throw it back in someone's face, I think they are inviting the goodwill to end. There is a particular concern, too, about the victims of crime. It does not seem appropriate that, where a person is not imprisoned but has an order made to pay an amount by way of reparation or restitution, they should be able to not pay for whatever reason and, tough luck, just sort of start again. If we misunderstand that, we will be happy to be told we misunderstand it, but I suspect that we do not. We would like that matter looked at by the committee as well. Other than those two matters&mdash;which is not to say that we are pre-determined against them but just that we want them looked at&mdash;we are supportive of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a new provision which allows the director-general to appoint an authorising officer at an appropriately senior level to approve persons who can exercise the authority of all warrants issued by the Attorney-General. However, the concerns expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are shared by the Australian Democrats. I express the hope that the government will attend to this so that the authority that is being given is limited to an appropriate senior level and is carefully defined. It only increases the number of people who can exercise the authority of warrants; it does not confer the power to issue new warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments in part 2 provide for officers of ASIO to be able to apply for vacancies in the Australian Public Service even though the positions have not been advertised as being open to the public. This brings ASIO officers in line with the rest of the Public Service. However, I was informed that originally the omission of this right was seen almost as a trade-off for other privileges that ASIO officers have and which are not common in the Public Service. I would appreciate the minister dealing with that question either in response to the second reading or in the committee stage of the bill. The view was expressed, `Well, what happens to the other privileges which are beneficial to ASIO officers: are they going to be taken away or are they going to stay?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill makes a number of amendments to the Crimes Act. The first of these is to enable courts to take cultural background into account when sentencing federal offenders. I understand that this particular area is of concern to the opposition. Senator Vanstone has indicated that this matter is one of the two matters that have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would be interested to explore that question. But I note that on the current wording of the bill it appears to be limited to the sentencing part, not to the question of whether or not a person is guilty of a particular offence. Part 3 also makes some amendments to the provisions concerning action to be taken in the event of breach of certain court orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 20 of the principal act enables a court sentencing a person to place the person on a bond and either partially or wholly suspend a sentence of imprisonment. </PARA>

Clause 13 of the amendments will extend the range of options available to a court where a person has breached a recognisance which has either a suspended sentence of imprisonment or a partially suspended sentence of imprisonment attached to it. The proposed amendments will enable the court to impose a monetary penalty not exceeding $1,000, extend the period of good behaviour, revoke the order, or impose an alternative to imprisonment, such as a community service order. This greater flexibility is also welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments will exclude ACT prisoners from Commonwealth provisions now that the ACT has its own escape provisions, and ensure that the sentence of federal prisoners convicted of escape under state provisions ceases to run for the length of the escape. That is something I would have thought was self-evident. I wonder if there have been any cases where the time spent on the run, as it were, was counted as part of the sentence served. The minister might wish to provide some information on that. Further, part 3 replaces outdated references to detention at the Governor-General's pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendments in part 3 will allow the manufacture, advertising, display, sale or possession of radio scanning devices. It will, however, remain an offence to use a scanner to intercept telecommunications without authority, and to disclose or use, without authority, material obtained from such an interception. These amendments are supported by the Australian Democrats, as is the amendment bringing the ACT into the national transfer of prisoners scheme and other amendments to the Crimes (Aviation) Act, the Customs Act, and the Director of Public Prosecutions Act. </PARA>

This amendment currently before the Senate will exclude this defence where a person was charged with an offence extraditable under the terms of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and related acts&mdash;clearly a measure designed to contain terrorism and one that, albeit with some misgiving, one would have to support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Environment Protection Council Bill establishes the National Environment Protection Council pursuant to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment signed in 1992 by the Commonwealth government, all state and territory governments and the President of the Local Government Association and establishes the council's functions and powers. The purposes and individual clauses of the bill are adequately explained in the second reading speech of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and the explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled. I will not delay the Senate by repeating those individual clauses. I indicate to the Senate that the coalition will not be opposing the bill, although we have one amendment which I will move at the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal coalition has always been a strong supporter of decentralisation and localised control. Therefore, we have some concerns that the National Environment Protection Council might lead to more centralised control in Canberra of the environment and particular issues in various states. We were at one stage concerned that it might force the state governments to forfeit their powers to disallow regulations and that it may reduce the international competitiveness and the efficiency of its administration by adding yet another layer of bureaucracy. We wanted to ensure that nothing in this bill added to the duplication and, in some cases, even the triplication of the services provided in relation to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When dealing with environmental issues on the scale of those listed in clause 14 of this bill&mdash;such as air quality, and marine, estuarine and fresh water quality&mdash;the coalition believes that there must be a concerted national approach. Those environmental issues are matters that affect Australia as a whole. They do not stop at the state boundaries. In many cases the states would not have the financial capacity to deal with those issues. For example, the problems with the salination of the Murray-Darling River are something that no individual state would have the financial capacity to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this bill provide that the states have the majority of say in any decisions made by the council. The council is to consist of a minister from each state and territory, and the federal minister. Under clause 28 of the bill, each decision of the council must be supported by at least two-thirds of the members. In that way the states will control the decisions because they will obviously have the greater number of members and there will need to be a two-thirds majority when decisions are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of establishing the National Environment Protection Council will be shared&mdash;50 per cent will be provided by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent by the states between them. The Commonwealth's cost of establishing the council, including the secretariat, will be an estimated $896,000 for the financial year 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a national environment strategy was a state initiative which arose from the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in 1990. The federal Labor government has been dragging its feet on this issue, I regret to say, for the four years since that decision was made. It has managed to toss the sensitive environment portfolio around like a hot potato to three ministers this year alone, which is a typical example of the little genuine regard the Labor Party has for the environment. It is very interested in the votes that it can gather in second preferences from the green and environment movement, but it really has very little genuine interest or concern in environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the ministerial reshuffling this year, the intergovernmental agreement on the environment was signed by the Commonwealth, the states, the territories and local governments. Through what some may say was the incompetence of the previous environmental minister, who, senators would recall, had a real expertise only in the area of whiteboard accounting, it has taken over two years to take the next step&mdash;that is, the adoption of this bill&mdash;to provide the legislative basis for the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as it stands, does not spell out that, as with many issues, environmental issues have a regional variation right around Australia. We on the coalition side believe that uniform national standards are impractical and that local solutions are required in relation to the environment because of the regional diversity of environment matters. For this reason, the coalition has proposed an amendment to clause 3 on page 2. We will be asking the Senate to adopt a clause that adds to clause 3 another subparagraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when making national environment protection measures the Council seeks as far as practicable to achieve effective harmonisation rather than rigid uniformity in such national measures.</PARA>
<PARA>We have worded the amendment along the lines of some words that the then minister used when she was talking about this proposal. We certainly hope that, having used the words the then minister used when speaking about it, the government will adopt that amendment as one it is in favour of. Mrs Kelly, who was then the environment minister, promised this. If that amendment is adopted, it will stop any hint of centralisation of rules in Canberra. The council must have the right to make individual decisions on environmental issues affecting local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect the government should consider, and which would provide a more equitable status between the states and the federal government, is appointing the chairman of the council on a rotational basis. We did, at one stage, consider moving an amendment to include in the bill that the chairmanship of the council should be with the Commonwealth one year, then with a different state in consecutive years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not gone ahead and moved that motion because we understand that there was a bit of bargaining and negotiating at the Premiers Conference where the rules were put together. We do not really want to upset a negotiation that has been achieved between the state governments and the federal government. We think the federal government would be well advised to consider rotating the chairmanship of that committee. The bill has been referred to by some state governments as `a happy cooperative model' but we suggest that it would be even happier and more cooperative if the rotational chairmanship proposal were adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mere fact that it has taken four years from the time this concept was initiated for it to get to this stage is another example of the current government's appalling record on the environment. It is forever stalling, commissioning report after report; rarely having the courage to make any sensible decisions in relation to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current minister, who unfortunately is still overseas on the Commonwealth Games jaunt&mdash;I say `unfortunately' because it would have been good if he had been here for the debate on this bill&mdash;has been stalling on the latest environmental issue that has arisen up my way, the Port Hinchinbrook or Oyster Point development. The state Labor government had given that development the green light and had subjected it to a number of environmental conditions. But the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) came onto the scene rather late in the piece and said that no further Queensland government decisions on the proposal would be taken up at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He commissioned yet another report into the issue, when the Queensland state Labor government had already subjected it to a number of reports. The draft version of that report was due out on 30 June 1994, with a final report due by 31 July, more than 20 days ago. It has been stalled until this week and it now seems we may have to wait even longer for Senator Faulkner to bring down the further report into Port Hinchinbrook. While that is not particularly relevant to this bill, it is another example of how the Labor Party is very slow when it comes to getting to the real problems confronting the nation in environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the environment minister, as is proposed, is going to chair this committee in the same way he administers his commissioned reports, that is a strong argument in itself for having the chairman of the committee rotate. With the one amendment that I have previously outlined, we will support the bill to put in place a body which will have the flexibility to consider the most effective means of achieving the required national environmental outcomes, recognising particularly regional environmental differences in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have some difficulty with the National Environment Protection Council Bill for substantially the reasons&mdash;but from the opposite direction&mdash;given by the opposition. Our difficulty is that this is yet another example of legislation which has come out of an inter-governmental agreement and is likely to produce the lowest common denominator of environmental protection, rather than the very best protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we support this legislation and accept a crumb which might be moving us in the right direction or do we reject it out of hand and hope that something better comes along? Our decision is to support the legislation, but recognising that it is only a very small step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the point which Senator Ian Macdonald made on the arguments for regional variation, I find it strange to contemplate that the people of North Queensland are not just as sensitive to lead in water, for example, as the people of Perth, Adelaide or somewhere else; and that a standard for toxic material, say in water and air, should be different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect members of the opposition are really on about the adoption of lesser standards in certain states so they can get some sort of short-term advantage, in terms of allowing a more polluting industry into their area rather than adopting the higher standards that might obtain somewhere else. We would certainly not accept that sort of variation for the reasons I have outlined earlier, that an ideal national environment protection council would be a national council which would promulgate national standards that would be applicable throughout the whole of Australia and would allow for the input of industry groups, public interest groups, environment groups, state governments and a whole range of people into the formulation of these standards; but would not give to the states and others the right of veto over those standards. We have that here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already Western Australia is saying it will not cooperate in this council. As a consequence, there is a government amendment on the table suggesting that should the complementary legislation in the various states not be passed within 12 months, this legislation will lapse. That would be a great pity because part of the procrastination and delay which Senator Macdonald complains about is caused precisely by the perceived need by the federal government to bring the states along in a cooperative venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our belief that we should be setting up a national environmental protection council which would be just that. The states would certainly have an input but should not have the right of veto. We could get on and move much more quickly in the establishment of these national standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the bill suffers from this fundamental weakness. It represents a very substantial compromise between the Commonwealth, states and territories and a compromise over environmental protection, driven by that political virus which plagues Australian politics, namely the battle over so-called states rights. I interpolate that states do not have rights; individuals have rights. The euphemism `states rights' has been allowed to damage politics far too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make another point in this connection&mdash;I have made it before but it is worth repeating&mdash;on legislation of this form. It is an issue that the opposition is also very sensitive to because the same factor affects legislation which comes out of international agreements: this type of legislation is negotiated between governments, often by bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the legislation is presented to a particular parliament&mdash;in this case it is being presented to our parliament&mdash;it is presented in a form which essentially we must rubber stamp. It is very difficult for us to modify by way of amendment. I believe that all the amendments that various parties to this debate will put forward will be rejected by the government, partly on the grounds that there has been an agreement between the several states and the Commonwealth in relation to this legislation and not one comma and not one full stop of that legislation will be changed because it requires complimentary legislation in the other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this very process that the opposition is objecting to in international agreements is being supported by it in the case of these intergovernmental agreements within Australia. The essential point is that it is bypassing the very political process which should involve the ability of this chamber and the other chamber to substantially change that legislation if that legislation is thought not to be suitable. That objective would also be achieved if this legislation were legislation of this chamber and of this parliament uniquely and did not require complimentary legislation and complimentary agreement by the several states to get this operation in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the whole approach encapsulated by this legislation is simply wrong. The bill sets up yet another ministerial council to develop standards, goals, guidelines and protocols. Ministerial councils have proved to be the political quagmires in Australian politics. They are opportunities for political jostling, petulance and prevarication rather than serious reform. They fail to bring forth substantial improvements in environmental protection or conservation, and very often they finish up with the passage of the least common denominator of environmental protection and environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council is supposed to provide the forum for a cooperative national approach to the environment; yet, as indicated already, Western Australia has already stated that it is not willing to be a party to the council. The Western Australian government has circulated a rather erroneously titled paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Thought Starter</EMPHASIS>. This is an example of further procrastination which comes out of the very thing that Senator Ian Macdonald supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper discusses the threat to the states of ever increasing Commonwealth intrusions into state matters. Let us once and for all put this myth of states rights to bed. States do not have any rights in the sense that human beings have rights. States have certain responsibilities that are accorded to them by the constitution, by law and by convention. As all honourable senators would know, all three things can change, and inevitably will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of environmental law and regulations the states believe that they have some kind of supreme right, a right that should not be challenged or tampered with by the Commonwealth. Where does this alleged right spring from? When the constitution was written, the environment was not an issue as it is now. The authors of our constitution did not have the foresight to see that global warming, land degradation, air pollution and so on would become critical national and international issues. They can hardly be criticised for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply by convention, the states took charge of matters relating to land, water and air quality. The states hold what are called residual powers over these matters. They are powers that are theirs simply by convention. They are not cast in concrete or stone. Conventions can and must be changed to reflect changed circumstances. I would have thought that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who likes to present himself as the great reformer, would have taken up the environmental challenge. I would have thought that he would realise that the way we deal with environmental issues in this country is anachronistic and in urgent need of substantial reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ex-Prime Minister, so beloved of the Australian people&mdash;R.J.L. Hawke&mdash;picked up this issue in the dying days of his prime ministership. He pushed the notion of the new federalism and initiated a so-called cooperative approach to environmental matters by the Commonwealth and the states. Bob Hawke did not do this out of concern about the irregularities and inconsistencies in environmental laws across the country. He did it because his cabinet colleagues forced him to back down after his courageous stand over Coronation Hill. Of course, he did it also to lay the groundwork which allows this Labor government to stand back and wash its hands of responsibility when it has to deal with a recalcitrant state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry groups pushed for a payback for that decision. The payback was the intergovernmental agreement on the environment which was made on 1 May 1992. This legislation implements schedule 4 of that agreement. Schedule 4 establishes a National Environment Protection Agency, which has now been renamed the `council' and which is the subject of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been a long time in coming. Senator Ian Macdonald referred to that. It is a product of the last days of Bob Hawke. The fact is that we are now in a different era and there is an urgent need for a new approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats wholeheartedly support a national approach to environmental protection. We support the principle of national standards, goals and protocols, but we would advocate an entirely different approach to achieving them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we want a constitutional change. I note that the previous environment minister, Ros Kelly, is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 10 April 1992 as saying on 9 April 1992 that, `If this'&mdash;referring to the intergovernmental agreement&mdash;`doesn't work, in my view we'll just have to go for some constitutional change in the environment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the current Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, shares her views on this matter because it is certainly the case that the IGAE is not working, given the withdrawal of Western Australia from the National Environment Protection Council. On World Environment Day this year, Senator Kernot called for a change to the constitution to include certain powers relating to, among other things: the discharge of substances into land, air or water affecting more than one state or territory&mdash;and surely nobody could gainsay the fact that that is a national issue; secondly, the prevention of land, air or water degradation affecting more than one state or territory; thirdly, the use of nuclear fuels, nuclear energy and ionising radiation&mdash;and surely we need national standards there; fourthly, the protection of areas of Australia of national and international significance; and fifthly, the protection of a species of flora or fauna from extinction. Surely these are all national goals which require a national approach and not an approach which can be undermined and subverted by a state fiat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of these powers in the constitution would make it very clear that the Commonwealth has the power to legislate to implement and enforce national environmental standards. Another one which has come up just recently is standards in relation to the composition of fuels for motor vehicles&mdash;something which industry would clearly be in favour of having. Different standards in different states bedevilled the pesticide industry for many, many years and it was strongly in favour of national standards. The same would apply in many areas across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must stress here that it is the opinion of the courts that the Commonwealth already has these powers to legislate. The Tasmanian dams case made that perfectly plain. The High Court decision in that case depended partly on the fact that the HEC was deemed to be a corporation within the meaning of the corporations powers under section 51(20) of the constitution, and in exercising that corporation power the Commonwealth had power to do what it did in that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this government has passed ozone protection legislation, one section of which depends fairly and squarely on the exercise of corporations power. That section of that act has never been challenged. The fact that there is still debate over this issue reveals just how much parochial state based politics drives this whole debate of Commonwealth versus state powers. The fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth, generally speaking, does not have the guts, does not have the political will, to exercise those powers under section 51(20) and also the trade and commerce powers under section 51(1) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that in the case of this legislation and other legislation dealing with the environment it is the environment that is the loser. It is not the states, it is not the Commonwealth; it is the environment which is the loser. The procrastination which has gone on has resulted in further and inevitable environmental damage. When the states win this fight, it is not the Commonwealth that suffers; it is, indeed, the environment. Because the environment is a public good, it is also the people of Australia who suffer a degraded environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of the recent fate of the National Crime Bill in the United States.

A recent poll conducted by the New South Wales environment department shows that, when asked the question `What is the most important issue facing Australia over the next 10 years', people stated that environment was their No. 1 consideration. In another recent poll, respondents even put environment before economic growth in their list of concerns. </PARA>

Yet our political leaders across the country continue to act in a shameful way by putting the politics of states' rights, so-called, before the politics of the greater good. It is quite shameful. Where is our Prime Minister in all this? He is nowhere to be seen on this matter. </PARA>

This bill is a far cry from such a reformist and exciting approach. Where again is the Prime Minister when it comes to bringing flair and a touch of excitement, terms which he has used, to environmental reform? This bill is based on a minimalist role for the Commonwealth, when a more expansive role for the national government is urgently required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are very disappointed with this legislation and will be proposing seven amendments which deal with three issues. The first is the removal of the reference to regional differences, so we are running quite contrary to the direction taken by Senator Ian Macdonald and his cohorts. This concession will be used by recalcitrant states to argue for lower water quality standards in rivers of high water flow. This approach is based on the antiquated view that the environment can assimilate pollution to a certain capacity before adverse changes are identified. This approach is wrong. We need to pursue a pollution prevention approach to stop pollution at source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acceptance of regional differences will do nothing to promote a clean, green economy&mdash;something which many members of the National Party in particular depend upon for an image of Australia which allows our primary production to be sold and accepted with a premium overseas. In fact, it will set back the acceptance of proper and strict standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of our amendments seek to allow for non-government organisation representation on the National Environment Protection Council committee. Another introduces financial penalties for the withdrawal of a state or territory from the council. That amendment is merely an attempt to pull the states further into line in relation to their willingness on some occasions, we believe, to actually jeopardise the adoption and implementation of proper standards if they do not like them or if they think they can get some temporary advantage by allowing more polluting industry in their particular part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we believe it is totally appropriate for the federal government to have the ability to introduce financial penalties if a state or a territory either withdraws from the council or fails to implement a complementary standard to that which is adopted by the Commonwealth and other states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Madam Acting Deputy President. Quite frankly, Western Australians are the best people to decide who can look after their environmental protection measures. I think it is absolutely outrageous for this federal government to believe that it knows best. How can it set national standards of environmental protection to apply in Sydney and in Melbourne, with their populations, in the same way as they will apply in Townsville, Kununurra, Broome, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Bunbury, Albany, Esperance and all points in between? It is absolute and utter nonsense to believe that that can be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy for Western Australia to be a recalcitrant, if that is what Senator Coulter wants to call it, if it means that, first of all, we disagree with him but, most importantly, that we consistently resist any form of federal intervention in areas of total and utter state responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter cited the Tasmanian dams case as a perfect example of where the federal government should intervene in state issues. I am glad he mentioned that because the Tasmanian dams case remains the classic example of the federal government overriding the wishes of people in the states. The Tasmanian people actually voted in a government that promoted the development and the building of that dam, yet the federal government overrode their wishes. This is what is happening again, because this is purely and simply another attempt by this government to rob the states of their constitutional powers. How many times is this government going to be allowed to do it before everyone in Australia realises that this is the underhanded way in which the Labor Party is going about trying to diminish the roles of the states?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has actively sought to erode the powers of the state and territory governments through the ratification of treaties and the use of its external affairs powers. Senator Coulter can quite happily stand in this place and say that the selective use of the external affairs powers is quite desirable whenever this government disagrees with an action that has been taken by a state government. The federal government now, of course, wants to rob the people in the states and territories of the right to have meaningful input into the environmental and resource management issues of particular concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many will really have their views considered by federal ministers, and what opportunities will they or their lobby groups have to present their arguments to the minister? The simple answer is none, because no feedback is going through to this government. The minister is not seeking input from people in the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the fact of the matter is that the requirements of a place with high density population are nowhere near the same as those of other parts of Australia. Elements within the government and the Labor Party and, of course, the fruit loops in the Australian Democrats, like Senator Coulter, would have us believe that they should be the same. There is just no logic, no commonsense, to it whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The powers of the NECP will be very inclusive. It has to manage and control ambient air and water quality, noise, site contamination, hazardous waste, motor vehicle emissions and recycling. Once again, how can anyone in their right mind say that those requirements need to be national. Why cannot the states, the local governments and the people in the local areas decide what is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of these areas goes above and beyond the original agreement on the need for a consistent approach to air and water pollution made at the first special premiers conference in 1990. This federal bill now has far greater scope and authority than was ever agreed to by those heads of government present in 1990. Why has it been changed? There has not been any further consultation in real terms. The intrusion of federal laws into what are essentially local environmental issues will inevitably lead to inefficiency, duplication and higher costs as a result of the entanglement of federal and state laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we hear people such as Senator Coulter talking about the fact that this is a minimalist role when the government should be taking a more expansive role, or that a more expansive role is required, we really have to ask ourselves, `Where is this country heading when people can stand in this parliament and say that the states have lost their rights?' There has been no vote which has caused them to lose that right. There has been no change in the constitution whereby they lose that right. Yet we get clowns like Senator Coulter coming in here and saying that it is quite desirable that that happens. It is simply, totally and utterly undesirable from the point of view of Western Australia and every other state and territory that wants to govern in its right and proper form. This is of particular concern to Western Australia because not only will it disempower Western Australia, but it will disenfranchise the local communities from their rightful place in the discussion process which should accompany the implementation of any environmental protection strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the local councils&mdash;whether they be in Port Hedland, or in Broome, or in any of the other country areas such as Kalgoorlie&mdash;who have real questions on environmental issues pay particular attention to make sure that they protect their environment. They jealously protect their environment because it is in their interest to do so. They do not need some heavy-handed federal government, accompanied by silly Australian Democrats who are assisting, aiding and abetting it, usurping that role from those local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has a healthy scepticism of politicians as it is. When decisions are being made in places as far away as Canberra is from these local communities, is it any wonder that they continually become more sceptical as time goes by? They do not believe that a group of bureaucrats in Canberra, or politicians who do not get out into these country areas, can really decide what is in their best interest. We have a classic example of that today. This bill is doing exactly that. This bill will be intrusive and its intervention will be very confusing. It will breed uncertainty about the safety of local environments. Australia's many unique environments have been well served and successfully maintained by the state and territory governments of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even someone such as Senator Coulter could not give any real examples of where the state and territory governments have let down their state or territory. There are no real examples. He can wave his magic wand. He can wander off overseas on delegations and shamefully lecture countries on environmental issues&mdash;and pretend to speak on behalf of Australian parliamentarians, I might add&mdash;as can the Greens in this place. But the fact of the matter is that their vote is minuscule in this place. They do not represent a jot on the horizon in the reality of the people who vote. Those very people are saying, `Get your hands off our local areas.' We cannot deny the reality that these people represent so few in electoral terms that it is a miracle they are here. But why do they not get out there and talk to the local communities? What are they afraid of? Why do they not go and make sure that they get the majority view, not the minority view which they are always keen on attracting?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national uniformity of measures would threaten to set back the many achievements made in the area of environmental protection. One of the main concerns of the Western Australian government is the lack of safeguards against further Commonwealth intrusion. I agree with that concern. When we have a coalition of the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats, that concern is particularly real. The opportunity for further intervention is as real as I am standing here today. Another major concern is the lack of evidence that this bill will improve environmental protection or management. There is a lack of documentation on the value of this council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for the Western Australian position is quite clear in terms of a consistent approach to air and water  pollution, as agreed to in 1990, but not for national and overriding legislation. Why has the decision that was taken at the Premiers Conference in 1990 been changed? There is absolutely no justification for the inclusion of motor vehicle emissions, contaminated sites, recycling, hazardous wastes and noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major concern which the Democrats and the Greens will never have to worry about is the cost of duplication  because, as I said, thankfully for this country they will never be the government. The cost of duplication does not worry them. They will never have to balance the books, they will never have to look at deficits, and they will never have to look at taxes because they simply will never run the country, thankfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we have to try to get some sense into this whole issue because this bill and the council would jeopardise efficient protection of the environment, with the confusion of water quality strategy being one of the most immediate issues. The powers of the council are complex and its functions would frustrate investors and other ministerial councils. Do we want to create more difficulties for investors in this country? We have the Mabo legislation that this mob once again helped to pass at the end of last year. That has put investment back no end in Western Australia. It has put development back. It has put a lot of the projects back. But this mob do not care about that. They do not care about the national interest with regard to investment or anything of that nature. This is going to frustrate investors, but it does not matter. It will be okay as long as they think this is in some way going to fit their narrow view of what Australia should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major concern is that it increases the bureaucratic process. That will not benefit the environment or the economy. But, once again, increasing bureaucratic processes is not a worry for the Labor Party. It has never been a worry for the Greens or the Democrats. The council would reduce international competitiveness by the introduction of another centralised, regulation decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its uniform standards are impracticable because of Australia's diversity. Australia is a huge country and all parts of it are different. The council is costly. It is unnecessary. The effective consensus mechanisms already exist through bodies such as the Australian and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council. But, once again, today it appears that we are going to have further duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of the council survives only because of inertia, ignorance and a lack of debate. Unfortunately, that has never stopped legislation going through this place in the past and I suspect it certainly will not today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's environment is vast, isolated, diverse and rich in resources. Would it not be nice if we could actually use it to its full potential without constantly having impediments put in its place? It is a unique country to have such a wide range of assets. However, here we have further legislation which puts this country's diversity immediately at odds with any concept of national uniformity which presupposes that Australia and its population is one homogeneous mass. The council is therefore fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In remote areas of Western Australia which generate much of the nation's great wealth of mineral resources, which unfortunately the minor parties would have us cease forthwith, environmental issues are generally site specific and sustainable development requires localised criteria and management. The quality of Australian skills in this area is world renowned and what makes it so is its application to a diversity of global environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state and territory governments have taken a particularly responsible attitude to the environment and are continuing to do so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to establish an authority which will be responsible for the publication, dissemination, monitoring and reporting on the implementation and effectiveness of national environment protection measures. These national environment protection measures cover such areas as ambient air and water quality, site contamination, environmental impacts of hazardous wastes and motor vehicle emissions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one has to question consultation when it is actually counterproductive to the aims set out. In this legislation the consultation process will at best be a long and drawn out one and at worst, as a first case example, will be easily derailed by an intransigent and spoiling state government such as the Court Liberal government in Western Australia. The Western Australian government has already indicated that it does not intend to participate in the National Environment Protection Council. I quote the Western Australian Minister for the Environment, Mr Kevin Minson, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that the National Environment Protection Council will improve environmental protection, environmental management or sustainable development in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I am forced to agree with my own state government's sentiments on this point, even if for very different reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the historical context from which this bill arises, it does not contain any sanction for a state which fails to participate. Just to refresh our memories, one of the biggest concerns about the intergovernmental agreements on the environment was that the Commonwealth gave away its overriding power to the states, and this legislation makes similar arrangements. There is no compulsion on the states to enact legislation or put in place arrangements to implement measures. The bill does not even contain any sanction for states which refuse to participate. Therefore, it will be marred by obfuscation from any state which does not want to agree to a national measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states can use clause 15 of the bill in many different ways to foil environment protection. It requires the National Environment Protection Council to take into account cost effectiveness, and social and economic impacts as well as other existing international treaties or intergovernment mechanisms when developing a national environment protection measure. When important environmental considerations are to be weighed up against short-term social and economic impacts, then those environmental considerations will inevitably lose out. There is no sense of the precautionary principle being applied here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a state can argue that it is not regionally viable on economic grounds to put in place a particular environmental measure, the National Environment Protection Council will be compelled to accept this or see the state threaten to leave the process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the sound of an intergovernmental agreement may be notionally a rational and practical solution to the limitations of particular governments in particular subject areas, it suffers from a basic lack of enforceability and accountability and can only effectively give us statements of government policy. My understanding is that there is no power and that, even if it was taken to the High Court on particular issues, there would be no possibility for any kind of judicial determination on the rights in the particular case. Furthermore, even if it could be taken to a higher authority or to a court, that court itself would encounter enforcement difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the federal government legitimately already has these powers because of its capacity to sign international treaties and to agree to universal standards of best practice. It already has funding power and the capacity to help states bring about better standards in the environment but it is virtually giving away those legitimate aspects of power. The legislation prevents the federal government and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) from taking a direct role in setting clear standards on the environment and helping with the enforcement and implementation of those standards through legislative and funding support. This bill basically represents a washing of the hands of the federal minister for the environment and giving up his job to the states which have already demonstrated a very inferior capacity to look after those particular areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In listening to Senator Knowles I was forced to agree with her concern that local community people who are desperately concerned about environmental conditions will see this bill as intrusive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is the local community level, and people there in general are far more concerned about the environment than people at the federal government level have shown themselves to be. However, the point, particularly in my own state of Western Australia, is that often local communities find the federal government far more receptive than the state government to their concerns on environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my recent trip around the south-west of Western Australia and in the wheat belt the continual complaint was that the state minister for the environment was failing to protect the environment, was failing to do the job that the community wanted done, and that the only recourse for them was to appeal to the federal minister to intervene and try to persuade the state government to do its job. That arose in many instances, and it is an indication of international treaties giving local communities more power. It gives them a right of appeal beyond a state government that is being intransigent and refusing to listen to their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Greens are very unwilling to support a bill of this kind, because what it effectively does is try to tie down the standards of the federal minister for the environment to potentially lower standards that the states will be able to discuss.

They are very stringent and strong controls. We have only to go through the processes, which I will not detail now, to know what rehabilitation processes a mining company has to commit itself to before it can development a mining site.

I believe that out of the government's approach we will see people becoming very concerned and hesitant to participate. It is one thing to deal with bureaucracy in one's own state; it is a totally different aspect to deal with it from Canberra.

My view is that there is nothing it can do that is not already being done. I also want to point out the role that the conservation and land management department has in Western Australia in dealing with certain environmental aspects, and also the division of resource management which is dealing with the landcare situation in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate last week&mdash;once again, I might add, but this time with the shadow minister for the environment, Ian McLachlan&mdash;to do a tour of Western Australia. It was very encouraging, particularly when we saw from the air some of the reclamation work that was being done in some of the catchment areas. I am the first to admit and acknowledge that there is a long way to go. However, we saw that problems have been identified and are being addressed&mdash;and successfully addressed. We also spent some time in the south-west looking at the development of plantation forests on both private and degraded public land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend to anybody who happens to be lucky enough to come to Western Australia to take the time to look at some of the work, and they will see that these problems are being addressed. There is only one reason why they are being addressed in a successful manner, and that is that the work is being done by local people on the ground who live there. As soon as we start putting in place such things as what is here beyond the ANZECC position, increasing that bureaucracy, we are going to create another level of suspicion around this whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great reservations about this legislation. I do not believe that it will achieve what we are being told it will achieve. I also want to place on the public record some information I received from the Western Australian state minister, Kevin Minson. It seems that since 1990 there has been a change of position by the federal government, moving away from uniformity and towards consistency. While that, in itself, is a good thing, it does not mean there is still a necessity for this measure. We need to know what the government's long-term intention is. I will quote from the press statement put out yesterday by Mr Minson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am delighted that in a recent letter to me which he circulated, Senator Faulkner now says that it would not be sensible or practical to require identical environmental protection measures in all parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Faulkner must now also admit that there is no need to create his new El Supremo of pollution control, the proposed National Environment Protection Council (NEPC). It would be unnecessary, costly, inefficient and a whole new layer of government bureaucracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He wants harmonious measures instead of uniform ones. I agree with such an aim, achieved through existing federal processes such as the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already mentioned the council. The press statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANZECC, without NEPC, is already far advanced on a National Water Quality Management Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original justification of NEPC given by the Commonwealth Government was that it was the only way to achieve uniform national standards and override State and Territory pollution control agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expertise and responsibility rest with the States. Senator Faulkner now also agrees that measures may vary across a State. It makes no practical sense to try to centralise control and make each State Environmental Protection Authority an agent of the EPA in Canberra or NEPC.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that these concerns that have been expressed by a number of people on this side of the chamber are put on the record. It is also important that we get a commitment from the government in terms of this legislation that the bureaucratic process is not going to interfere with a lot of good work that is already being done across Australia&mdash;whether it has to do with protection of the environment, identifying some areas as pristine and to be left alone, or whether it has to do with sustainable development. My concern is that every time we put a costly level of bureaucracy into the process, we end up with a result that is not the right result and which impacts in the wrong way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having raised those particular issues and concerns, I also note the amendment that Senator Ian Macdonald will move in due course. I particularly support this amendment because it will make this legislation much more sensible and it also emphasises the points that need to be made with regard to the amendments to be moved by the government. I suggest that those amendments have resulted from Senator Faulkner's somewhat changed position to that of the government's back in 1990 when the agreement was signed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That certainly clarifies the position, and I think it amplifies a point which I made during the second reading debate&mdash;and the minister has not stated it here, but he may well state it for the record&mdash;and that is that this, again, is one of these pieces of legislation that comes out of intergovernmental agreements because it requires complementary legislation in other states in this case. We are prevented in this chamber from amending it and that, of course, bypasses the proper political process. We are elected into this chamber to consider this legislation on its merits and, if we seek to amend it, we should be permitted to amend it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case&mdash;as I suspect, although the minister has not stated as such&mdash;one of the prime reasons that the government will not accept amendments is that we are dealing with this need for complementary legislation. I put this back to the opposition to consider the fact that it is wanting this complementary legislation. One downside of that is that that complementarity necessarily bypasses the proper political process: we cannot amend this legislation. We have been in that position before. Members of the opposition are picking this up quite frequently in relation to international agreements and saying that that is imposing requirements on Australia which are unacceptable and which bypass the proper political process and consideration, and, to a degree, we agree with them. I simply ask them to reflect on the fact that we are dealing with legislation which they want in this form because they want state involvement and yet the same principle is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This preamble seeks to anticipate amendments in three areas. Firstly, it seeks to remove the references to take into account regional, environmental differences in Australia. We are taking a position here that is very different from that of the opposition. The intergovernmental agreement, which is published as a schedule to this bill, mentions for instance that among other things the parties agree that a national approach should be taken to rare, vulnerable and endangered species. This is given the fact that the distribution of these species and their habitats is not confined or determined by state or Commonwealth borders and that a national approach is desirable to avoid duplication of effort&mdash;the very thing that Senator Knowles was concerned about&mdash;to ensure appropriate outcomes and to maximise the effectiveness of available resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various states and the Commonwealth recognised in this intergovernmental agreement the uniform nature of the problems in relation to terrestrial and aquatic species, degradation of land, salinisation and all those sorts of things, and the states have agreed to this need for uniform standards and legislation. So the provision in this bill for the recognition of regional environmental differences, we believe&mdash;and the opposition's amendment that it would seek to move later on goes even further&mdash;is simply a cop out, a way in which the environmental standards can be distorted to allow damaging processes to occur in one area or state and to give a state a temporary industrial, environmental advantage with lower costs to attract industry to that area, rather than to go into another area where higher standards obtain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, Senator Knowles cannot maintain that the states are doing a perfect job of looking after the environment when we have incredible land degradation and salinisation and the worst loss of species of any country in the world. We have feral animals that are raging across this country, across state borders. We have water quality which is deteriorating in every area. We have air quality in cities which is atrocious. We have greenhouse gas emissions, which are among the highest in the world. For Senator Knowles to somehow imply that the states are perfectly looking after the environment and there is no need for Commonwealth intervention just flies in the face of so much evidence. This first section of the preamble, which anticipates a later amendment to allow these regional differences, is simply to allow some parts of the country to get away with lower environmental standards and to continue to degrade their environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we seek to provide for non-government environmental organisations to have observer status on the National Environment Protection Council. This goes part of the way to meeting that input by concerned, ordinary people that the opposition referred to so enthusiastically a few moments ago to allow their participation by way of having observer status on the National Environment Protection Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, contrary again to what Senator Knowles said and as I mentioned in my speech on the second reading debate, in the ANOP survey of 1991 when people right across Australia were asked whether they wanted and supported national environmental standards, 68 per cent said that yes, they supported national environmental standards. So they want the national standards but, of course, it is appropriate and there are mechanisms within this legislation by which they should have access to them. </PARA>

<PARA>The report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Subsistence to supermarket: food and agricultural transformation in South-East Asia</EMPHASIS> is interesting. It is a substantive work in terms of volume and has quite a lot of detail. Obviously, it has not been possible for me to read the 370-odd pages in the time that the document has been available to us. I focus, however, on some comments made in the document in relation to Vietnam. Whilst the document is generally fairly accurate, from what I can see, particularly in relation to its comment on Singapore and Brunei, I think it is appropriate to look at the comments that have been made about Vietnam, especially in view of the current interest in this country about liberalisation in Vietnam and some of the hype that has been going around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 179 there is a prediction that the government will be unlikely to increase the scope of sugar production. I think the exact phrase is that the scope of further expansion of sugar cane production would appear limited and mainly focused on domestic demand. This comment is inaccurate. It is true that in previous years production of sugar has never exceeded 475,000 tonnes of raw sugar equivalent; last year it was about 420,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is also very clear that the government has set as one of its priorities an increase in the production of raw sugar to one million tonnes per annum by the year 2000. It is not correct to say that there is limited scope for expansion of the sugar industry. In fact, the government is setting aside areas and is expected in the next year or two to open up an entirely new area for the production of sugar cane. The problems which have existed to date have been problems in relation to the processing of cane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely possible that they could get substantially greater volumes of cane in Vietnam than are currently being grown at the moment. Remember that in Vietnam every single tonne of cane is cut by hand; most cane is grown on farms that do not exceed 1 1/2 hectares; and the cane is cut by the people who grow it. There is no effort at the moment to put mechanisation into the harvesting of cane and the varieties of cane that are grown are old and inefficient and the yields that are being achieved are very low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, there is substantial scope for improving the tonnage of cane which is cut, particularly with substantial investment from Taiwan. I know there is a proposal for the Taiwanese to build a sugar mill as well as plant between what I understand to be several hundred thousand tonnes of cane. There is very good scope for improvement in the tonnage of cane that will come off, and that will be driven very heavily by foreign investment. So I think it is a little dubious for us to assume that there will not be some growth in cane production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the document overlooks one of the areas of growth for the Vietnamese agricultural industry, which is palm oil production, again driven on the back of investment from principally Malaysia this time. That is in reaction to a slow but noticeable increase in the cost of farm labour in Malaysia. Of course, palm oil production being reasonably labour intensive, the Malaysians have sought to move outside Malaysia and there has been very heavy investment in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my comments tonight by focusing on the comments about cattle production. It is true that cattle numbers have doubled to around 3.3 million head over the last decade. But that does not equate to good quality cattle or beef production. The average weight of an animal going to market, I understand from the national veterinary company, is only 200 on to 250 kilos live weight. The reason why the animals are so small at the age of three years is that they have been worked in the field pulling a plough for two or three years before finally being knocked on the head. As a consequence, they are animals of low carcass quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add to that the fact that there is rampant foot and mouth disease and tuberculosis, that there are no disease control mechanisms to prevent animals moving from infected areas to non-infected areas and that the farmers do not have the money to invest in looking after those animals, I think it is fair to say that the Vietnamese cattle industry does not offer a substantial threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a big increase in the demand for meat coming into that area as a result of increasing standards of living.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 this government spent $114 billion, up nearly $5 billion or 4.3 per cent. The government took in revenue of over $100 billion; for the first time in this nation's history, this government has taken from the Australian people in revenue over $100 billion. That was an increase of $5.6 billion, up 5.9 per cent, at a time when the recession was only just coming to an end. As a result, we have a deficit of $13.6 billion. So this is the national household spending $13.6 billion more than it received in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look in the document, we find hidden away in outlays is a credit of $2.4 billion for asset sales&mdash;this is selling the silver to pay the recurrent expenditure. So we have a real recurrent deficit of $16 billion. That is the underlying deficit run by this government&mdash;$16 billion. As a result, the government has had to borrow in the last financial year $13.6 billion, which has obvious consequences for real interest rates. We now have the highest real interest rates in the world. They have, of course, just gone up and they are going to keep on going up as a result of the deficit program of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public debt interest in 1993-94, as revealed in this document, was $6.5 billion; we had to pay out $6.5 billion just in interest.

We are paying that out in interest in just one year and, of course, we have deficits going on into the interminable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total government spending under this government has nearly doubled in the last 10 years: it was $64 billion in 1984-85; it is now $114 billion.

If we look at the crunch issue, total income tax on individuals, as revealed by this document, has gone up 4.7 per cent in real terms. At a time when we are just trying to come out of a recession and we have massive problems with unemployment, this government is taking from Australians another 4.7 per cent in real terms in personal taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax went up 10.8 per cent in real terms in the last financial year. The hypocrisy of this government is unbelievable. This is the first financial year after the government's campaign against the GST, and it has increased sales tax by 10.8 per cent in real terms. Excise duty is up 10 per cent in real terms under a government that campaigned against the goods and services tax. Total tax revenue has almost doubled in 10 years of Labor. It has gone from $53 billion in 1984-85 to nearly $94 billion in 1993-94. Of course, when we add other revenue we get over $100 billion. It is an indictment of Labor and it is something that we will be reminding the electorate about from now right through to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government tax revenue in real terms has been increased in all but two of the last 10 financial years. In eight of the last 10 financial years, tax revenue&mdash;the money this government takes from ordinary Australians&mdash;has increased in real terms. Despite taking so much money out of the hands of ordinary Australians, the government still continues to run big deficits. We have to pay tax money to pay the interest on the debt, and the debt keeps accumulating every year. This document is a classic example of what is wrong with Labor and what distinguishes us from Labor. Labor is the party of high taxes, high spending and high deficits. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am informed that the eagle series rugged high resolution colour monitors have a number of special characteristics which distinguish them from a standard PC monitor. Standard PC monitors are not generally regarded as suitable for the rigours of many defence and mining type applications. During their manufacture eagle monitors are "ruggedised". That is, they are specifically designed to withstand severe shocks, vibration, moisture and they are also magnetically shielded for security purposes. Typically these monitors are installed in tanks, trucks, patrol boats and military aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. As a result of the agreement Australia's export potential of defence industry products is significantly enhanced. I believe that under the exclusive rights agreement, which BAeA has secured, all Codar eagle series monitors sold by Codar or BAeA into any Pacific Rim country will be manufactured in Australia by BAeA. Sales of eagle monitors may also enhance the sales of more sophisticated and related BAeA products such as operating consols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import replacement potential of the Australian produced eagle monitors in Defence Department contracts is also significant with tenders such as the Minehunter and P-3C both requiring the supply of "ruggedised" monitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. I am informed that the manufacture and sale of the eagle series monitors and associated equipment will be undertaken at BAeA's Salisbury (SA) facilities, and in time, could provide work for up to 30 employees. The manufacturing process associated with the monitors involves electronic assembly, integration and performance testing but will also incorporate some mechanical manufacturing work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The information technologies sector is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors of the Australian economy, valued at $A11.2 billion in 1993 (2.1% of GDP) and forecast to grow to $A17.7 billion by 1998. Currently, Australian information technology exports are round $A1.4 billion annually, and growing strongly. These exports represent around 2.1% of total exports of goods and services for the financial year to date April 1993/94. The Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) reports that its members' imports of information technology goods and services have increased by some 8 per cent over 1992/93 figures, in line with market growth, to around $A2.3 billion. These imports represent around 3.35 percent of total imports of goods and services for the financial year to date April 1993/94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) For the financial year 1993/94 twelve international and four Australian information technology and telecommunications companies joined the Partnerships for Development (PfD) and Fixed Term Arrangements (FTA) Programs. Manufacturing formed an integral part of some companies' agreements. A number of international and Australian information technology and telecommunication companies have expressed an interest in joining the program in 1994-95 and it is expected that manufacturing activities will form part of their industry development undertakings. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology manages these programs which encourage international companies in the information and telecommunications industries to invest in commercially sound activities in Australia. Indigenous Australian companies which wish to have their growth potential recognised and which view a closer working arrangement with the Government as strategically important can also enter a Fixed Term Arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Exact figures relating to the number of people employed as a result of these activities are not available but the agreements are expected to substantially increase employment in the sector. The anticipated value of activities proposed by these companies for 1994 will amount to $A104 million of export income and $A33 million of direct investment and technology transfer. In 1993/94 Partnership companies reported exports of approximately $1.2 billion and research and development invested in Australia of $300 million. This is a sixfold increase on the 1988 levels when the first agreements were signed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Fortunately, Israeli air attacks on Hizbollah bases in southern Lebanon do not appear to have affected negotiations between Israel and the PLO on the question of Palestinian self-rule. The signing on 4 May 1994 of the agreement on the transfer of Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian self-rule, the return of the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat, to the self rule area, and the commencement of talks on the extension of self-rule in the West Bank all occurred against a backdrop of intermittent Israeli military action against Hizbollah in Lebanon. (As of 11 July, there had been 22 Israeli air raids against Lebanon in 1994.) Earlier, the Israeli ground and air assault against Lebanese territory in July 1993 failed to prevent the negotiating breakthrough that resulted, two months later, in the historic Declaration of Principles. The Israel-PLO talks have indeed proved remarkably resilient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, nevertheless, deplores the continuing Israeli violations of Lebanon's sovereignty&mdash;especially Israel's self-declared `security zone' in southern Lebanon, which flouts UN Security Council Resolution 425&mdash;just as it deplores Hizbollah's attacks on targets in Israel. It is the Government's firm belief that the long-term stability of Lebanon, and an end to the violence in southern Lebanon, are dependent upon the conclusion of a comprehensive peace settlement in the region, including peace treaties between Israel and Syria, and Israel and Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that the Government condemns in the strongest possible terms the recent terrorist attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets in Buenos Aires and London. These attacks underline the importance of achieving a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government receives regular advice from Israel and the PLO on their respective expectations of the peace process. Naturally, they frequently hold differing views of the same event or situation, since they are, after all, locked in a complex negotiating process&mdash;one in which each side must also deal with its own internal disagreements over strategies and goals. In a sense, it is unrealistic to expect the two parties to have fully-developed, and publicly-aired views of the ultimate outcome of the peace process. We are still at the beginning of the interim phase, which is scheduled to end no later than May 1996. When this phase ends, talks on difficult issues affecting the permanent status of Gaza and the West Bank are scheduled to begin. For the time being, both sides are moving ahead warily, and the experience of the self-rule experiment will obviously shape their expectations of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can, however, be said that the views of Israel and the PLO on some issues have of late grown a little closer. The leaders on both sides are aware of the obstacles in the path of the successful implementation (and extension) of Palestinian self-rule; and they are both doing all they can to maintain the negotiating momentum. For Israel, the most important test of the Palestinians' credibility as a negotiating partner is their ability to maintain public security, and to adhere to the spirit of their agreements with Israel. For the PLO, Israel's willingness to allow the extension of Palestinian self-rule, and not to stifle the new Authority's powers (or further erode its credibility), is critical. At the moment, both sides are guardedly optimistic&mdash;even if they disagree over the desirability or inevitability of a Palestinian state, for example. We can only hope further progress fuels their optimism. But it would be foolish to ignore the potential for differences as it would be to assume that such differences are unbridgeable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Progress has also been made in several of the other tracks. The joint declaration between Israel and Jordan, signed in Washington on 25 July, effectively ended the state of belligerence between the two countries. Israel and Jordan have committed themselves to negotiate the early conclusion of a peace agreement and to take a series of practical steps to normalise their relations and embark on a new era of cooperation. The Australian Government certainly hopes that the breakthrough in the Israel/Jordanian track will breathe new life in the other negotiating tracks of the peace process. In fact, the Israel/Syrian track is now showing signs of renewed progress following US Secretary of State Christopher's recent visit to the region. The United States is playing a role as an active intermediary between the two parties who have begun to outline to each other their views on issues of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the course of regular contacts with the PLO, Australia has indeed received requests that we do more to channel our official assistance to the occupied territories directly through the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), the PLO's own development arm. As you know, there is an urgent need for financial assistance to, and reconstruction in, the self-rule areas. Last October, Australia agreed to contribute $15 million over three years towards economic development in the occupied territories. But in view of the critical importance of start-up funding for the new Authority, we have decided to provide over $1 million in immediate cash assistance through a World Bank trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that the PLO has expressed itself satisfied with our existing plans to contribute a large part of the $15 million to UNRWA, the importance of whose work all sides acknowledge, and part to Australian NGOs working in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Government will, of course, maintain contact with the Palestinian Authority (and with the Palestinian Council, once that is elected) but it cannot conduct a diplomatic relationship with any Palestinian governing authority until such time as that authority represents a state. That is because Australia recognises states, not governments, and there is at present no Palestinian state or `State of Palestine' in existence. The establishment of such a state may well be the outcome of the current peace process, but it would be premature to anticipate that outcome at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current policy towards the PLO is based on the same logic. The PLO is the representative of the Palestinian people, and we recognise it as such; but we recognise no Palestinian state of which the PLO can be said to be the government. We can only conduct diplomatic relations with the government of a Palestinian state.</PARA>

Australia has signed and ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and under the Convention is committed to aim for stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. The Government has adopted the National Greenhouse Response Strategy as a first step towards meeting its obligations under the Convention. By adopting the NGRS Australia has undertaken to act on energy consumption and greenhouse emissions. The Government has repeatedly stated that climate change is a global problem which needs a global response in an equitable manner. While developed countries have recognised the need to take the first steps in addressing climate change, the problem can only be solved if all countries eventually take actions consistent with the objective of the convention. The Government recognises that the convention will benefit Australia. Our environment and economy, especially the agricultural sector, are potentially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia recognises the concerns of countries in the Pacific region because of their particular vulnerability to the potential impacts of climate change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Australia is not abandoning, and will not abandon, the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It has gained substantial credibility on environmental issues. This credibility has allowed Australia to play an influential role in international environmental negotiations including the negotiations under the climate change convention. Part of Australia's credibility is that it has been frank and open about its own economic circumstances and the difficulties it faces in reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to the dependence on fossil fuels both for energy generation and in earning export income. Australia will play its part in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, but it will not take action which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Australia is not abandoning, and will not abandon, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and is not refusing to take measures to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse emissions. Australia's active participation in negotiations under the Convention make it well placed to play a part in the growing international market in energy efficiency technology. Exports of Australian environmental technology goods and services are growing strongly, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, and are currently estimated to be worth over $200 million annually.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Part of the Government's reason for seeking to have the airlines collect the charge is that international comparisons have shown that the administrative costs of collection of the existing departure tax are high by world standards, at 4&mdash;5% of revenue collected, compared with about 2% in other countries with similar charges. The Government expects that it should be possible for collection costs for the new Passenger Movement Charge (PMC) to be of the same order. In deciding to implement the PMC, the Government also decided that it would meet the airlines' establishment and running costs of the necessary systems. The airlines are presently determining what those costs might be. On the assumption that the ongoing costs are comparable with international experience, there will be no costs to airlines for collecting the PMC. I might point out that the British government is imposing an Air Passenger Duty from 1 November 1994, to be collected by law by airlines, but will not be meeting  collection costs. This Government's decision to meet reasonable collection costs reflects our recognition of the importance of the travel and tourism industry to Australia, and the Government's desire to work with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) See (1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As reported by a Departmental official at Estimates Committee D on 26 May 1994 (page D49), the National Passenger Processing Committee (NPPC) Working Party on Cost Recovery Options for Passenger Processing considered the effect of cost recovery on passenger numbers. Drawing upon previous studies of demand elasticities for international travel, the NPPC Working Party calculated the possible hypothetical reduction in passenger numbers. Using the same methodology, an increase of $2 in the level of charges might lead to a reduction of between 2000&mdash;5000 travellers. However, the Working Party did not take into account the positive impact that increases in charges might have in inducing Australians to take domestic, rather than international, holidays and it therefore qualified its calculation by saying that `. . . the net impact on the tourist industry from a CIQ charge is unknown, but it will certainly be less than the figures above suggest, considering only foreign tourists. We cannot even be sure the overall impact will be negative.'  The other factor that the Working Party did not take into account is the effect that collection of the PMC by airlines will have on streamlining passenger movement at airports, contributing to a positive image of Australia as a destination because of the ease of movement into and out of the country. Overall, it is clear that the effect of the $2 increase will be negligible.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The requirement was introduced in 1986 but withdrawn after representations from industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No international student is required to pre-pay tuition fees for any type of course or college.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Migration Regulations, which had the pre-payment of tuition fees as a criterion to be satisfied before visa issue, were amended on 1 October 1992 to remove pre-payment of course fees as a requirement for a student visa, as recommended in the Industry Commission Report 1991 on the export of education services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The requirement to pre-pay tuition fees as a requirement for visa issue has been removed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most private colleges and public institutions retain their own requirement that applicants pre-pay part or all course fees. Recognising the need to safeguard such pre-paid tuition fees and the integrity of Australia's international reputation following the collapse of the Australian Business College in Perth in January 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training held an inquiry into the efficacy of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS Act). The Committee's report recommended that the ESOS Act be amended to require that pre-paid international students' funds be placed in formal trust accounts. Similarly, the Committee recommended that providers be members of tuition assurance schemes which would guarantee the protection of students' funds and/or the delivery of courses equivalent to those that had been paid for. The requirements relating to trust accounts and tuition assurance schemes apply only to non-exempt providers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 21 June 1994, the Department, through its Services Branch, purchased a quantity of "Face to Face" performance appraisal training videos and software, and one "Side by Side" Corporate Pack performance agreement training videos and software. Each "Face to Face" pack contains two videos (Video 1 for managers and Video 2 for appraisees), three booklets (Leaders Guide, and a booklet each for Videos 1 and 2), and one computer disk (containing text files of the three booklets, thus enabling customisation). The "Side by Side" Corporate Pack contains two videos, three manuals and ten CompuTutors (software enabling simultaneous performance agreement training and the production of a performance agreement).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A total of 30 "Face to Face" packs, and one "Side by Side" Corporate Pack were purchased, at a total cost of $40,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Department has this year introduced a new performance appraisal system for officers both at home and overseas, and accords its implementation high priority. The training system, purchased from Vitascope Productions after careful consideration by management and training staff, is well suited to the Department's needs. Five of the "Face to Face" packs will be used to assist in performance appraisal training of Departmental staff based in Canberra. The training will take one of three forms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">scheduled training workshops of up to three hours, led by a Departmental trainer and using the videos to supplement other performance management techniques;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ad hoc Branch and Division training as requested, led by a Departmental trainer; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">individual home or work-station based training, whereby an officer borrows the video on a short term basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of "Face to Face" packs will be used for post and regional office performance appraisal training. One pack will be sent to each post and regional office on a one month rotation, so that within a three to four month period all posts and regional offices will have had an opportunity to use the packs either through a workshop or individual use. A performance appraisal manual will accompany the pack, with instructions for how the workshop should be conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of "Face to Face" to be used by non-expert trainers was one of its attractions for this Department. Within a very little time, with the aid of the Leaders Guide booklet, an officer at post can act as trainer. Thus, considerable money is saved and posts and regional offices are able to have the benefits of performance management training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "Side by Side" Corporate Pack has been purchased on a trial basis, to test its value in two contexts:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">as a database tool which allows management to monitor the translation of the Departmental mission statement into practical performance agreements; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">as a training tool for performance agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The "Face to Face" training packs will be used by all officers of the Department, whether employed in Canberra, at a regional office or at an overseas mission or post. The "Side by Side" Corporate Pack will be used by a small number of Senior Officers and SES as a trial for its potential wider application to senior management performance agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) "Face to Face" provides guidance in the conduct of performance appraisals from the perspective of both the appraiser and appraisee. Both videos present two appraisal scenarios (in a neutral work environment, using professional actors). The first is an employee and her supervisor who both dread appraisal because both approach it in the wrong way. The second scenario shows performance appraisal conducted well. The scenarios are structured such that the good manager advises the poor  manager as to how to get more out of appraisal (Video 1 and Booklet 1), and the well-managed employee helps the poorly managed employee get the most out of her appraisal (Video 2 and Booklet 2). The booklet and accompanying overhead projections clearly indicate appraisal do's and don'ts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Side by Side", on the other hand, is structured as a meeting of managers (using the same neutral work environment and the same actors), discussing the merits of striking performance agreements. As such, it is far more didactic in tone than "Face to Face", but is nevertheless extremely interesting as a training tool, run by the officer him- or herself together with supervisor, which actually results in a complete performance agreement at the end of the process.</PARA>
