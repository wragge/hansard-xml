The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to that motion. What should be understood is that the government is substantially changing the program that it earlier set out. In particular, the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Bill is dropping down the list. I understand that that was as a result of a request from the Australian Democrats because of the ill health of Senator Coulter. We understand that and will  cooperate in these unfortunate circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government ought to realise that senators on this side have worked long and hard to prepare that bill for debate this morning. They worked late into the night last night and are ready. We were told it was coming on today. I hope the government understands that, if this is going to occur and at the last moment we are to be told that bills are no longer going to be debated in the order that we have been told earlier, this should be a give and take situation. Towards the end of last session, when we made a request in similar circumstances, the government objected to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are at the beginning of the session and the government is already substantially changing the program it has set down. We respectfully ask that, if that is to happen in the future, we be given more notice than the notice we were given this morning. We also make the point that, if the government is going to ask for cooperation with substantial variations to its program, it should recognise that when we ask for such changes in reasonable circumstances and it ought to accommodate us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my leader's concern about this matter. I am sorry that Senator Coulter is ill and I wish him well and a speedy recovery. However, this is a concern to me. I understand that neither the Democrats nor the Greens are ready for this bill. I am handling it on behalf of Mrs Gallus and was not ready either, but I ensured that by doing some work last night my staff and I were able to get the matter under control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of some concern that we find out this morning that it is not going on. I also note that the space bill is coming on a bit earlier. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure which made a report on matters that I understand are being taken up in that bill, I wanted to speak on that legislation. However, I am not ready to do so now because I have been concentrating on this bill. I do not suppose that will receive much consideration from the Greens or the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that various factions of the Labor Party rearrange the program as they did yesterday to suit themselves. There are winks and nods all the way along and the three groups of the Labor Party look after themselves. We do not seem to be taken into account when these things are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about this change in the order of business and not only the change in the position of the wet tropics bill, but also the change in the order of all those other bills in such a way that will cause disruption to us. It is no wonder that the government cannot run the country even with the help of its allies, the Democrats and the Greens, if it cannot even get the order of today's program correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I note the points raised by Senator Hill and Senator Ian Macdonald.

<PARA>I have moved for the suspension of standing orders so that we can deal with the motion relating to the tabling of documents concerning Centenary House.

<PARA>During Estimates Committee D there was a lengthy debate about the rental, terms and conditions and processes by which the Australian National Audit Office entered into a lease in the building known as Centenary House and owned by the Australian Labor Party. I do not intend revisiting all of the arguments and the political controversy about that deal here today. There are other forums where that will be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, during the inquiries at Estimates Committee D, ably supported by my colleagues Senator Parer and Senator Minchin, I sought information from the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office in relation to comparable rentals in Canberra. We also put to the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office the contention that, in the current property climate, this would be one of the highest effective net rentals in the whole of Australia, including all of the large commercial capital cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a contention I still hold, but it is something that is hard to establish unless we have information, and this is the information that we seek here today. It is information that we sought during the supplementary estimates process. The information has been partially provided by the Australian Property Group, but what we seek here is information which will actually help the Senate reach a conclusion on this  important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Estimates Committee D, I asked the officers whether they could find any evidence of any higher effective net rental anywhere in Australia, and in answer to that question the Australian Property Group officers provided me with a very short piece of information which is effectively no information. They said that they had found that in June 1993 there was a pre-commitment lease somewhere in New South Wales at $462 per square metre, and that somewhere in Victoria in May 1993 there was an effective rental of $399 per square metre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When discussing this matter privately, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have said to colleagues that that would be very similar to someone coming to me and claiming that his house is worth $100,000 and, when I ask, `Why is that house worth $100,000?', saying to me, `I know that somewhere in Victoria a house was sold for $100,000'. Of course, it is very interesting to know that somewhere in Victoria a house sold for $100,000, but one needs to know whether that house is made of wood or stone, and whether it has got three bedrooms, four bedrooms or five bedrooms and what size land it is on. In fact, unless one knows all of the crucial details of the property, it is hard to establish the relevance of the fact that somewhere in Victoria a house was sold for $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to commercial property, the same principles apply. It is no use saying that somewhere in New South Wales or Victoria a certain rental was set unless one knows where the building was, what sort of building it was, and how large the area was. As Senator Parer said to me this morning, one needs to know whether it was a street-front shop of only 50 square metres or whether it was a massive amount of space which might accommodate 200 or 300 people. Those are crucial pieces of information, and without that information the simple provision of a bland rate per square metre is of little help in our inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had it put to me that the government defends this by saying that it would offend the credibility of the Australian Property Group if it were to provide this information. Madam Acting Deputy President, I say that it is offensive to the credibility of the Australian Property Group to provide information to the Senate that has no credibility in terms of property professionals: that is, to provide a bland rental rate with no supporting evidence. It offends the credibility of that organisation that it would even seek to have senators accept that sort of information without at least some detail as to the relevance of the rental rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek further aspects of the information to determine what is known as the effective rental. I do not want to bore the Senate too much with what an effective net rental is, compared to what a net rental is, but most of my colleagues from Western Australia&mdash;and I see Senator Chamarette here&mdash;will know that during the late 1980s property developers went mad and ended up building a lot of very big buildings that no-one really needed. The developers have, in recent years, been offering people enormous inducements to attract them into the buildings. Those inducements can be free fit-outs, free partitioning and so forth; they can be free rental, which means that one can enter into a lease for 10 years and not pay any rent for five years; or they can be reduced rentals. There is a whole range of inducements that are being used to attract people to the empty buildings in Perth, Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that reduces the effective rental that is received by the landlord. If one is doing a comparison of rentals paid in a building where there was no incentive paid with those in a building where there was an incentive paid, it is very hard to say that one rental rate is comparable to another for the purposes of a valuation, because the bland rental that is put into the lease agreement may well not reflect the real rental value of that building. When it comes to taxation purposes, when it comes to local government ratings and water ratings and so forth, one needs to determine a figure that is a net effective rental, which is the real rental that is being paid to the landlord. I think that is the simplest explanation I can give of what an effective rental is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in more simple terms for people, when it comes to renting out houses, for example, if a person were to rent out his house for $200 a week but give away the first six months of that year as free rental to induce someone to come in and rent the house for a year, the effective rental would be only $100 a week instead of $200 since no rent would be received for the first six months. I think that is probably the simplest explanation of what an effective rental is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this information, we are seeking to find out the value of the inducements that may surround the thin information the APG has provided to the Senate. We need to know the value of those inducements; we need to know also the breakdown of the outgoings, the insurances and all the other amounts relating to the leases so that it is possible to determine what is the core rental that gets paid to the landlord, the Australian Labor Party, in that building. Then we can find out whether or not this is the highest net effective rental in the whole of Australia, which is what I suspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, we have had to go to this further length to get what I consider to be quite simple and important information. I cannot understand why the Australian Property Group would not provide this information to the Senate. It is not commercial-in-confidence information. It certainly does not breach the confidentiality of APG customers, which the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, said in his answer to my question on notice No. 889. This information, as I have said privately to the Democrats and to the Greens, is information that is readily handed across the counter at the Australian Valuation Office every morning to valuers and trainee valuers and their secretarial support. It is information that is handed across the counter at a state valuer-general's office. </PARA>

They pay a small fee, which is usually to cover the photocopying. That information is provided, and it is provided without any questions being asked. It is outrageous that a junior trainee valuer, as I was many years ago, can go and get that information from a government agency such as the Australian Valuation Office or the Land Titles Office or the valuer-general's office of state governments, but that, for reasons considered confidential, the Australian Property Group will not provide that sort of information to the parliament of Australia in what is a genuine investigation into the credibility and confidence the Australian people should have in the property dealings of the federal government as they relate to the Centenary House deal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Campbell. My reasoning is this: we have already had substantial debate on Centenary House, which I will not go over again, but in the process of that debate two points were made. One was the impropriety of a government in power arranging a lease deal which, on the face of it, had all the elements of secrecy that produce suspicion that a special deal has been made. The other part of it, and this is the nub of the points raised by Senator Campbell, is the question of accountability. What the department has done is try to fob off Senator Campbell in a very straightforward question. One of the most important aspects of the Centenary House deal was the level of rental paid, the escalation provisions and the net return to the Australian Labor Party. These lease conditions, which are not supported by the Department of Finance, are not just a cost to the government, a cost to the Auditor-General, but, ultimately, a cost to the Australian taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the impropriety, and the view that the general public takes about deals being made by incumbent governments, if the rental is a fair rental we do not have a lot to object to. Just as an aside, honourable senators might recall that one of the greatest stirs that occurred when the Russians saw the light and chucked out the Communist Party was to do with the deals made on properties owned by the Communist Party that had been paid for by the Russian taxpayers. So it is a matter of propriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the motion moved by Senator Campbell. For the parliament to be able to determine whether a fair deal was made, we must know comparative costs paid by other clients of the Commonwealth government. It is a clear accountability that we are looking for. It is no good the department trying to fob off Senator Campbell and saying, `Here is the rental in Sydney', but refusing to give any other details on the basis&mdash;in my view, the phoney basis&mdash;that this is a matter of commercial-in-confidence. The Department of Administrative Services, the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office are accountable to this parliament, which represents the people of Australia, the taxpayers of Australia. To come along and say, `Here is the rental, but we will not give you any other details, so you cannot ascertain the net rental', is arrogance. It is the sort of arrogance we have come to expect in this country. It is important that the response be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Campbell indicated, what is wrong with the government telling us the address of a property which is rented by the Commonwealth? No wonder we had the suspicion right from the word go, when the then secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bob Hogg, denied that there was any deal made for the leasing of Centenary House, and when subsequent information provided by the minister himself indicated that when Mr Hogg made that remark at a committee hearing, in response to a question by then Senator Olsen, the deal was almost completed. That was, I might say, without the knowledge of the tenant, the Auditor-General. He did not even know at that stage that the ALP owned the place. He thought it was Lend Lease, because they kept referring to it as the Lend Lease site, or to the joint venturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with the department advising Senator Campbell as to the address of the property? What is wrong with the department advising Senator Campbell and this parliament of the net lettable area? Surely that is not commercial-in-confidence? What is wrong with the government providing Senator Campbell and this parliament with the date of commencement of the lease? These are leases in respect of property in New South Wales and Victoria where the claim was made: `We have got a higher rental than we pay to the ALP at Centenary House'. What is wrong with giving us a breakdown of the building outgoings on a per square metre basis&mdash;this is normal information that is available&mdash;and the effective value of any incentives? As Senator Campbell has indicated, over the past couple of years, with the surplus of space available, all sorts of incentives have been paid. The only incentive paid on Centenary House has been to the ALP. </PARA>

We will get the opportunity again; and I understand that there could be an inquiry into it anyway by the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>

The purpose of this motion is to insist that the government provide that information so that proper and sensible comparisons can be made. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that commercial confidentiality extends to a commercial contract that is concluded on behalf of, by or for a government authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point raised by the minister was in answer to a question of mine as to whether the government would be prepared to supply this information asked for by Senator Campbell to the Auditor-General's nominee who is conducting an inquiry into the Centenary House matter.

If the answer is that an inquiry may be conducted&mdash;I note that Senator Parer used that expression; I do not know whether he is correct&mdash;can the minister confirm that an inquiry is actually in progress or has been irrevocably committed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some sense, Senator Spindler, Senator Chamarette and I have been put at a bit of a disadvantage in the sequence in which this matter has been debated. I think there was an apprehension that, if I spoke, in some way it closed the debate, and therefore everyone spoke before my argument was heard. I have to say that that is not true; it is not my motion, so my speaking to it does not close the debate. It might have been better had I been called earlier, but I did not want to have a row about that. If those honourable senators wanted the call earlier, I was happy to comply. But let me just urge them&mdash;as they have indicated they will, which I appreciate&mdash;to approach that which I say with an open mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the commitment they have and, on the basis of the work we have done together over the years, I hope they accept that I share a commitment to accountability of the executive government to this parliament. There is no doubt that all of us, whether we are ministers or public servants, who are paid by the taxpayers have an obligation to be accountable to those people whose money we appropriate to fund services, some of which are provided to us as income&mdash;opposition, government, minor parties, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have sought to argue on previous occasions, probably when I was on the back bench and certainly as parliamentary secretary, and as minister on two or three occasions, that there were times when I thought the parliament was seeking to exercise its rights in a manner that I thought was inappropriate, that is not to say that the right should not exist. I do not regard it as some breach of principle to say that a parliament has a right to do something&mdash;that right is acknowledged; but then the view is that it should not exercise it in these circumstances. That means that one has to think about the consequences of acting or failing to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In judging whether it is appropriate to exercise an undoubted right, one needs always to contemplate the consequences of exercising it. Would the Senate, for example, by failing to support Senator Campbell's motion, in some way undermine its right on a subsequent occasion to seek information which it desired? The answer is quite clearly no. The Senate's right to demand information is clearly established otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two or three issues here, and I will respond to the explicit points Senator Spindler raised. The first and primary one is the question of commercial-in-confidence. At the end of the day, it is not the most powerful argument in this particular instance, but it is the general point that is before us. I think there is a more powerful argument about how we should decide on this matter on this day, which I will come to in a moment and to which Senator Spindler alluded, relating to the independent inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a view which I think some, but not all, in this Senate share about the legitimate role of public enterprise and public sector businesses in a mixed economy. To take previously exclusively government departmental activities, turn them into business-like operations, free their clients&mdash;the other public sector agencies&mdash;from the requirement to use their services and make them compete with the private sector, which has undoubted efficiency advantages, is an approach that some in the opposition might wish to go further. But I think it is an approach which, while those things are in the public sector, they would generally support. They might say that the businesses should not exist&mdash;that is an ideological debate we will have on another occasion&mdash;but, for so long as they are in the public sector, I think generally they would share the view that that is a way of using the competitive pressure to deliver the best outcome for the clients and to maximise the efficiency of the public sector agency, which now does not operate from budget appropriation but which is required to meet its costs through the income and fees it generates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to take that step, we have to give those public sector businesses fair and reasonable opportunity to compete and a reasonable opportunity to be successful. We have to distinguish here between the role of the tenant and the role of the agent. Because I do not know the detail of the contract, I cannot say this for certain, but if, as I assume, the tenants in these two cases are public sector tenants, Australian government tenants, then no such public sector agency could resist an inquiry from the Senate that it should provide the details of a lease into which it has entered. It is spending the taxpayers' money and is accountable for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the same as saying that, because the clients happened through a competitive process to choose a public sector agent to represent them, it is reasonable that the agent should have to disclose the clients' business. If they had chosen a private sector real estate agent, the Senate would not be saying that the private sector real estate agent has to disclose his or her or their client's business. We do not do that. We do say to the public sector agencies, `You have to supply', and they do. They have to come before estimates committees and be questioned about it. But it is a dramatically different argument to say that, in a competitive environment, if one chooses to be represented by a public sector agency, one does so in the knowledge that the parliament might require the agent to supply the client's information to it. One has a choice between a public sector agent who might, if the Senate is so minded, be required to supply one's information to the parliament, and some other agent who will not have that obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the argument I was putting. If because of the pressure of time I put it to Senator Spindler in a way that gave him a slightly wrong impression about the status of these contracts, I apologise. I do not know, but on the information that is before me, on the written face of the document, it seems to me that these are finalised contracts. I was not arguing that they were not. Because I do not know every dot and comma, there may be some element that is not finalised. But that is not part of my argument, nor is it relevant to the point I am seeking to make. I understand that there would be a different status if they were not finalised. That is not the point I am seeking to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not seeking to hang my argument on that hook. The point I am making in regard to that matter applies to finalised contracts as well as to others. It will simply lead people not to choose the public sector agency and make it unviable, and I do not understand whose interests that is perceived to be in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is whether the failure to provide this extra level of detail makes it impossible for the Senate to discharge its function of accountability. In the first instance, I think the answer is no. The information provided in response to the original question, which is listed in the material distributed by Senator Campbell on this occasion or which was certainly on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and given to him previously&mdash;I think he refers to it in the question&mdash;was that the two leases in respect of which he is seeking further information are examples of effective net rental. The problem for him is that they give the answer he did not want. So he is trying to dig a bit further to see whether he can undermine the accuracy of that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is whether there are comparable leases to the lease of Centenary House. It is a matter of judgment whether they are reasonable leases or not. As to whether they are comparable, the answer is clearly yes. The information necessary to establish that has already been provided. It is possible, and if no other avenue is available it is reasonable, because it is of concern to the Senate, to ask, `How can we be sure that these people are telling the Senate the truth?'. I do not have any reason to doubt them. To be fair to Senator Campbell, he has never implied, in the estimates committee or anywhere else, that he has reason to doubt the integrity of the officers who supplied the information. Although there have been some slurs thrown around, to be fair to Senator Campbell, he has not done that with regard to those officers or to any other officer, in the recollection I have. So I was not meaning to imply that he had done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to doubt the integrity of the information that has been supplied, but we do have available to the parliament an opportunity to scrutinise this information without putting in jeopardy the question of commercial confidentiality. If the opportunity did not exist, we would be confronted with a very difficult dilemma because there would be a conflict of principles. In this instance, there is a conflict of principle already. There are two good arguments, but I think there is a mechanism that reconciles them. That is the independent inquiry to which I referred. It has not commenced but the terms of reference have been agreed. I forget the term Senator Spindler used, but there is no possibility that it will not go ahead. Should we wish to, and we do not, it is not open to the executive government to stop it going ahead, because the Auditor-General has the independent capacity to pursue it. Even if we said, `We do not want you to do that', which we have not said, he would proceed anyway. The legislation gives us no capacity to stop him having this inquiry. We do not want to stop him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely untrue. We do not wish to stop him. This is going at a bit of a tangent, but I will respond to Senator Campbell's point to ensure that there is no unfairness to Mr Willis. I have very strongly supported Mr Willis in this, quite explicitly. We have expressed our concern to the Auditor-General. We have said that we do not think something conducted exclusively by the Auditor-General is appropriate because one of those people under review, whose actions are involved in this matter and therefore must be under review, is the Auditor-General, and he should not inquire into himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what Mr Willis put, and what is agreed between the Minister for Finance and the Auditor-General, is that there should be an inquiry conducted jointly in part by his nominee under the Audit Act and Mr MacPherson, the South Australian Auditor-General, and one by the Independent Auditor of the Auditor-General, Mr Boymal, whose integrity I think is not in question. Therefore, somebody who is seen to be independent of the Auditor-General is looking into this matter; so there is independent assessment of everybody's actions in it, which I think is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues of the appropriateness of the contract are covered by the terms of reference. I give an unequivocal undertaking to Senator Spindler that I will make this information available to that inquiry so that, if there are concerns about the adequacy or accuracy of that information, they can report. One part of the terms of reference that has been agreed is that the committee will have the right to report to the parliament&mdash;not just to us so that we can shred it, bury it or do whatever people feel we may otherwise wish to do with it. Of course, the Auditor-General does report to the parliament, so if this committee wishes&mdash;and I expect it will, but we are not telling it what it has to do&mdash;to report directly to the parliament and to say that the information provided to Senator Campbell in response to his previous question in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> was inaccurate, it has that capacity independently to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has available to it the opportunity to have on its behalf an effective, independent, confidential scrutiny of this without cutting across the commercial-in-confidence rights of APG. If we did not have that, I accept that we would be in a bit of a dilemma and that the Senate would have to resolve it. I sense from the remarks here that it would resolve it against the view I take. I understand that argument. I do not totally share it, but I do understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a proper concern about guaranteeing and protecting the proper rights of the parliament to ensure that the information supplied to it by the executive is accurate; that is an unquestioned right. How we exercise it is a matter for our judgment on each occasion, but I do not seek in any way to undermine that right. I could not if I wished to, but I do not wish to in any way. Firstly, there is a question of principle. Secondly, I have lived with the democratic process long enough to know that nobody is in government forever. We would wish to be able to exercise the right to pursue information from the executive in the event that we were to return to opposition. I regret to say that I know one day we eventually will, and for so many years of my public life we were. It seemed that that was going to go on forever as well, and I am grateful that it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that inquiry will go ahead. Even if they do not ask for it, I will take the initiative of providing this information to those independent inquirers. They have the capacity to report back to the parliament. I expect them to. I cannot say that they will because they may choose not to for some reason that I cannot imagine. So I cannot give the Senate a guarantee. They have the right to do that if they so choose, and I expect they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Senate's reasonable concerns can be covered without jeopardising the commercial entitlements of the Australian Property Group. A further and reasonably imminent opportunity to review whether the actions I have outlined are adequate will arise. I should have made the point earlier that the agreement between the minister and the Auditor-General is that that inquiry should report by 12 April. So if we are not satisfied with the information, or the inquiry, or the adequacy, we are not going to have very long to wait before the Senate has a further opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, I hope the Senate will not choose to pursue this motion further on this occasion. If the Senate wishes to make it absolutely clear that it is keeping open to it the right to pursue this further, it is perhaps open to it to defer consideration until the report from this inquiry. I would not resist that motion. People can make it absolutely clear that the sword of Damocles is overhead, but I do not feel threatened by it because I am comfortable with that resolution. It is not, of course, my preferred option; I would prefer to see it defeated, but I would not resist that compromise option if&mdash;I suppose it could only be Senator Campbell because it is his motion&mdash;the Senate were minded to proceed in that way. Alternatively, it could easily, within 24 hours, reactivate the resolution after 12 April if he is not satisfied with the outcome of the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand Senator McMullan's real sensitivity to this, because it is all done by the federal secretariat of the ALP, of which Senator McMullan was for many years the federal secretary. I do not in any way suggest that Senator McMullan personally was involved in these deals, because I think at the time he had left the position of federal boss of the ALP secretariat.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from that background, I refer to the three questions Senator Spindler asked. Senator Spindler was somewhat persuaded by what he thought Senator McMullan said to him, which was that the lease was in the course of negotiation and was at a sensitive stage. Senator McMullan has clearly said that that is not the case. As far as Senator McMullan is concerned, it is over and done with. That answered Senator Spindler's first two questions in a way that I think would have Senator Spindler conclude that he should support our motion. </PARA>

He has given that undertaking, and by doing so he hopes he can get Senator Spindler to say that the parliament does not need to get it because Senator McMullan will give it to the Auditor-General. I have no doubt that Senator McMullan will give it to the Auditor-General; but why can we not have a look at it, too, as representatives of the people? We may want to make some interpretation, some calculations, and perhaps some submissions in relation to it. There is, in my view, no reason why we cannot get it if the Auditor-General can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be even briefer, then. I was just going to say that I can confirm what Senator Campbell has said from my experience as a property lawyer for many years. If the lease is concluded, and if we know the names of the parties, we can simply go along to the New South Wales titles office, get a copy of the lease and find all this out. How does that relate to Senator McMullan's argument of commercial-in-confidence? That material, once the lease is registered, is available to anyone, so it in no way affects the commercial-in-confidence ability of the Australian Property Group.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once the lease is registered, all the details are there for any member of the public to go along and get them. So if we can get it from there, why can we not get it from the minister? What is his argument about commercial-in-confidence? I gather from what Senator Spindler says that he does not need my assistance any more on this. He has obviously woken up to Senator McMullan's very skilful attempt to divert attention. I think the other parties are well aware of the baselessness of his argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will try to be as brief as I can. Senator Macdonald has very helpfully covered some of the points. I agree with the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, in some respects: there is a very subtle balance that needs to be found in these matters. None of us would seek, regardless of our judgments about the commercialisation of DAS businesses, to jeopardise them. Indeed, that would hurt the interests of the Australian taxpayer because the businesses would be less successful, and they might need higher subsidies, property adjustment programs, staff adjustment programs and everything else to make them operate successfully. I did listen very carefully, and I know Senator Spindler and Senator Chamarette did also. I remain unconvinced that the balance falls on the side Senator McMullan seeks. He has confirmed that these are both public sector tenants&mdash;and we did not even know that until we had this debate today. We were not sure who the tenants were.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know, and this is the problem I am dealing with. I have diligently&mdash;to describe what I think my actions have been&mdash;pursued this matter. I have not sought to overly politicise it, to the extent that I can restrain myself. We are seeking information that is important. The frustration I have is that every time I put a question on notice to Senator McMullan about this or any other issue I get these short answers and excuses as to why I cannot get any more answers. I get to the stage where I think that, if I keep asking Senator McMullan and his department questions, sooner or later they will get the message that it is probably better to give a fuller answer in the first place, rather than having me go back every 30 days and ask for supplementary information. They might get the message sooner or later that it is better just to come a bit clean and be a little more accountable, so that we do not have to spend an hour on a Thursday morning seeking information that is readily available through other places, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald has dealt with the argument about private sector real estate agents. I think there is, however, some validity to Senator McMullan's argument that there is a slight difference between the two and that we are, in this circumstance, requiring the APG to provide information that people such as Jones Lang Wootton or L.J. Hooker would not have to provide. However, because they are dealing with public sector tenants, those public sector tenants could be required to provide that information to the parliament at any stage anyway. That is because at estimates we know the property operating expenses of all of the agencies and departments, and it is open to any senator to ask for the details of those property operating expenses. We can get that detail whenever we want. It just sometimes takes a bit of time, as it is doing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think this information I am seeking is not of much relevance to the inquiry that I was pleased to hear Senator McMullan announce will be occurring into the Centenary House affair. It is not information that is really germane to that inquiry. I think it is a waste of that inquiry's time to have this information. But, as Senator Macdonald said, it is information that I regard as important, and I think it is information the Senate will be interested to know. We do need to know more of these details. We do need to analyse all of these other aspects to see whether, as I contended, this was one of the highest net effective rentals negotiated in the whole of Australia at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan raised the point about credibility. I do not suspect at all the motives of the Australian Property Group or the accuracy of the information it provides, but it has provided only a bland figure of four hundred and something dollars per square metre. Senator McMullan was indeed wrong in saying that the answer was not the answer I wanted to receive; it was the answer I suspected. But the answer is of little value to me because I cannot make a judgment as to what the figures really mean until I know the other information. I think the Senate has a right to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that needs to be made relates to the commercialisation of the DAS business units. In some business units there has been a very successful commercialisation; in others it has been less successful. The parliament has got a job to ensure that that whole process is accountable, but we also must make sure that those business units remain accountable. Just because they are in the commercial field, we cannot absolve them from accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we had this ongoing debate between Senator McMullan and me and others on Estimates Committee D about the pros and cons of the business units operating in the commercial field. Senator McMullan says that they suffer lots of disadvantages, just as the businesses they compete against in the true commercial world suffer disadvantages. Of course, one of the disadvantages of a government-owned business unit is that it has to suffer a little more accountability, but it would be very wrong for the parliament to absolve it from that accountability just because it is owned by the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with decisions made by the Government in respect of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides funding of $12.9 million in 1996, rising to $35.2 million in 1999,  for an additional 1500 undergraduate student places, including 500 to be funded jointly with industry. These new places are part of the Government's strategy for dealing with the continuing strong demand for higher education and significant regional shortages in the provision of higher education opportunities. This increase raises the total of new places created by the Government between 1989 and 1998 to over 100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced during the Budget that the period of rapid growth of funding in the sector had finished and that other mechanisms needed to be developed to ensure the efficient and effective use of public funding in maintaining  a high quality higher education sector. As part of this strategy the Government recently foreshadowed that it will be looking to shift some currently allocated places within and across States on the basis of institutional performance. Criteria for reallocating the places will be developed in full consultation with the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for higher education funding adjustments to cover the areas of superannuation, support for redundancy payments, and the Open Learning Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions include financial adjustments to funding for higher education superannuation expenses of $23.3 million in 1994, $12.9 million in 1995 and $15.5 million in 1996. The additional funding is being provided to institutions to meet the costs arising from the implementation of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under another measure introduced in this bill and in line with the Teacher Education Development Strategy, the Government will assist universities by supporting redundancy payments to excess staff. The Government will advance higher education operating grants for this purpose from 1995 and 1996 into 1994 and 1995, respectively, on advice from institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Open Learning Initiative reflects the Government's commitment to increasing access to higher education. Funding for individual years will be adjusted to better reflect the cash flows in those years while maintaining the total funding of $52m over the 1993-95 period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions include amendments to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). These changes aim to improve the operation and administration of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will correct an anomaly whereby certain fully funded overseas aid students are currently liable for HECS. The bill also clarifies the classification of student's course load units incorporating work experience in industry.   Guidelines will be provided to further assist institutions to clarify work experience units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures put forward in this bill will improve the arrangements for quoting Tax File Numbers (TFN), and clarify the responsibilities of institutions, students and the Commissioner of Taxation in regard to the notification of  TFNs for the HECS.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Guidelines for Determination of Eligible Child Care Centres (Childcare Assistance), CCA/4B/93/2, made under subsection 4C(1) of the Child Care Act 1972 with respect to the Minister's powers under subsection 4B(2) of that Act, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the coalition, I wish to initiate this debate to disallow the guidelines for the determination of eligible child-care centres. Since this matter was discussed late last year in this place, and indeed even while that debate was taking place, there has been considerable disquiet within the industry regarding child-care guidelines. I feel that it is the duty of the opposition to express this disquiet so that further consideration can be given to the impact of the legislation. For that reason I have moved this disallowance motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the numbers of working parents who need to place their children in child care, cost is going to be a determining factor as to where children are placed. With the implementation of the guidelines as outlined, there will obviously be some extra cost to the centres involved. The estimates of cost increases vary from the extremely low level increases cited by Senator Crowley to the far more realistic increases cited by independent consultants. The costings we have looked at are those by J.F. Taylor and Co. Pty Ltd, sponsored by the Association of Child Care Centres for New South Wales; Johnston Rorke, sponsored by the Australian Confederation of Child Care; and Shaw and Gay Pty Ltd, sponsored by the Child Care Association of Victoria. Senator Crowley maintained in this place on Tuesday that the increase in costs put forward by Senator Boswell had nothing to do with accreditation. Why then have the consulting firms used these figures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to indicate some of the costings involved if child-care centres are to adopt the child-care guidelines. J.F. Taylor did two cost modellings on long day care centres with 23 and 38 places. This consulting firm raised very important questions as to the accuracy of the Pitcher Partners study, on which Senator Crowley is basing her figure of a 55c increase. The J.F. Taylor study states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the limitations inherent in the Pitcher Partners approach (which they themselves acknowledge) cast doubts upon the validity of their cost estimate. These limitations include representativeness of sample, representativeness of the survey period, the lack of adult responses, arbitrary disqualification of so-called `extreme cases' and spreading of the seven week costs over fifty weeks (and thereby ignoring requirements which need to be conducted on a daily/weekly/monthly etc. ongoing basis).</PARA>
<PARA>J.F. Taylor, by comparison, admits that its figures are extremely conservative and not at all exhaustive. It also notes that significant cost differences may arise due to the `subjective application of the principles, i.e. different accreditation teams may derive different standards for the same centres due to the "fuzziness" of the terminology employed in the principles'. Its conservative costings estimate that additional costs of child care per child per week will be $33 in a low case scenario and $69 in a high case scenario. I will quote from the analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some examples that I would like to give the Senate and the Australian public of the costs that could be incurred by a child-care centre as a result of the accreditation guidelines being implemented. For a centre to maintain a full immunisation record which is updated as appropriate, estimating one hour per week for each staff member, the costing could be up to $689. For staff being encouraged to complete a first aid certificate, supposing that one staff member attends the St John Ambulance course run for two consecutive days from 8.30 to 4.30, followed by a two-hour exam two weeks later, the cost of the course could be $110 and the cost of relief staff for 10 hours, $227. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us suppose that the staff are encouraged to attend courses relating to adult and child health issues. Five three-hour courses on a Saturday morning, with three hours overtime for all staff, could cost up to $2,217. If staff meet regularly to discuss adult and child health issues and also consult with parents, the cost of overtime for all staff at eight hours per annum, which is indeed a conservative estimate, could be $1,064. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the guidelines refers to the use of picture books which are not stereotyped. Let us imagine that the child-care centre mentioned needs to throw out most of its library and obtain library books and picture books for children which do not contain gender bias. Even if it had a small number of books to buy, at $100, depreciated at 7.5 per cent, the cost would be $8. Most child-care centres, I imagine, would need to update their libraries at a vastly greater increased cost than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation with parents regarding a realistic set of guidelines for children's behaviour would usually need to be out of hours. Out-of-hours meetings with all staff at, say, eight hours per annum could cost $1,064. Yet another accreditation guideline is for information to be translated into the home language of the families. There are 10 languages recommended by the department of immigration. The cost of a translator at $70 per page, assuming that there were 10 pages and 10 languages, would be $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could give further descriptions of the way in which the costs will be carried on through this process of accreditation, but with application of the 52 principles involved it would be a lengthy and laborious process. I think the Senate will gather the implications of what I have been saying through some of the figures I have been quoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given these costs, how is it that Senator Crowley can use the figure of a 55c increase in costs per child per week in South Australia? How is this possible? Is the government going to absorb the cost and reduce the number of places available or will this cost be passed on to parents? The consulting firm of Shaw and Gay Pty Ltd concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All child care centres with registered places of 45 children or less will trade at a loss, resulting in a significant drop in the number of private child care places provided within a 12 month period from implementation of the Accreditation System.</PARA>
<PARA>If the cost is to be passed on to parents, there is every reason to suppose that parents will seek alternative avenues of child care and seek the assistance of neighbours, friends or unscrupulous backyard operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other concerns about the cost of measurement of the system. The Senate has had placed before it widely differing estimates of cost. There will be divergent estimates since the principles involved in accreditation can be subject to the widest possible interpretation. For instance, looking at some of the phrases I have used already, what does `continuous monitoring and evaluation of program' involve? How continuous is continuous? In the phrase `positive relationships', how positive is positive? Should consultation with parents be face to face or can it be dealt with over the phone? How often should it occur? We need an independent inquiry into the whole question of standards for child-care centres, not the regimented application of draconian principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 March last year, in yet another example of Labor's broken promises, Peter Staples said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No service will need or be required to put on new staff, increase qualified staff, buy new equipment or in any way incur costs because of accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the material I have outlined, how could this be so? I have already discussed some specific costs that accreditation will entail. More generally, accreditation will incur three different types of additional costs. The first can be described as salary related&mdash;that is, additional wages paid to staff for duties which would have to be performed out of normal hours or paid to relief staff for duties or activities which would have to be undertaken during normal operating hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, principle 43 requires the centre to maintain a record of children's immunisations. This would require a minimum of one hour's extra work per week for each staff member. Principle 48 concerns staff and parents consulting on the program and evaluating its effectiveness together. It is very difficult to assess the extra cost this would entail as the guidelines suggest only that evaluation be done frequently enough to ensure that the program remains relevant to the needs and interests of a particular group of children, whatever that means. The lowest possible cost estimate would work out at an extra eight hours per annum for each staff member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, accreditation will involve extra operational costs, for example, course fees. Principle 47 requires that information on health and other related issues is readily available to staff. It is suggested, among other things, that staff complete a first aid certificate. Costs then incurred would result from the cost of the course and the cost of relief staff or, if the course was done in the member's own time, overtime for each staff member. Principle 50 necessitates that staff are provided with regular learning and training opportunities. The conferences and seminars, short courses, training workshops, et cetera, which are suggested in the guidelines are ways to achieve this extra training and will all place a higher cost burden on each centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we can pinpoint areas where capital expenditure will be necessary, such as the purchase of additional equipment and increased investment in building or other equipment. Principle 3 requires that centres stock only books without gender bias or stereotyping. Principle 10 requires that information be translated into the home language of families. The Ethnic Affairs Commission suggests that public documents be translated into 10 different languages. The Taylor and Co. analysis works out that the cost of a translator is $70 per page, so just 10 pages of information in 10 languages would cost $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Rescue Work Society is reluctant to make definite calculations about the increase in the cost per week of child care, because it feels that the guidelines are so vague as to make accurate costing difficult. However, it estimates that it will lead to an increase of between $20 and $30 per week per child. Not only that, the centre has grave reservations about the principles outlined in the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, principle No. 1 says that staff must be genuinely interested in the children. How is `genuinely interested' assessed? In whose judgment? Should all staff who work at child-care centres be required to have a genuine interest in children, even if they do not interact with them? What about cleaners and administrators, who may not even have contact with the children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public position of the Sydney Rescue Work Society&mdash;and, I gather, of many other organisations&mdash;is that since the legislation has been passed it will go along with it. Its private position, however, is unchanged. It is still fundamentally opposed to the legislation. So we have the unhappy position of an industry fundamentally opposed to legislation but being forced to go along with it. Indeed, Mr Acting Deputy President, we have seen many examples of that in the entire government legislation program even in the short time that I have been in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about one of the fundamental tasks of a society: that of ensuring that the next generation is prepared for adulthood by caring, concerned representatives of this generation. A child-care centre must qualify under the accreditation guidelines before parents sending their children to the centre can qualify for fee relief. If the centre is forced to raise fees because of the onerous financial burden of compliance with the guidelines, many parents will be unable to afford the facilities and will resort to other forms of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with so much of this government's legislation, the law turns out to have most financial impact on those groups in the community that the government should be trying to assist. We saw that on Tuesday with the petrol tax increase which the Treasurer, Mr Willis, admitted was hurting low income earners most; and we see it today with this child-care legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of Senator Crowley's protestations that the costings by independent accounting firms of implementation of the accreditation scheme have `nothing to do with accreditation'&mdash;and I quote from her answer to Senator Boswell in question time in this place on Tuesday&mdash;these groups are using the figures. Why? Senator Crowley quoted in her remarks a figure from South Australia which put the cost per child of accreditation at 55c. How is this possible? There is an enormous disparity between those figures presented by the government and those presented by a significant number of groups in the industry. The disparity is such as to prompt the coalition to call for a disallowance of the child-care guidelines, and to call for a totally fresh look at the way in which child-care centres can maintain sufficient standards and the way in which parents who are in need can qualify for fee relief. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the government has shown great ineptitude in the handling of this issue of child-care accreditation. At first it provoked outrage over the guidelines, but that is not the argument today. Criticism was levelled at their intrusiveness and so-called political correctness not only from the National and Liberal parties but from clergy, parents and child-care centres, and from former Labor finance minister Peter Walsh. Mr Walsh described the handbook as 120-odd pages of platitudes, internal contradictions, nonsense and worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us concede that, from Senator Chamarette's and the Democrats' point of view, the accreditation is something that they desperately want. Let us concede that and move into the area of cost. As we dig deeper into the whole affair, however, there are emerging very serious defects in the proposed administration of the accreditation scheme which can be considered quite independently of one shade of political correctness&mdash;the Greens, the Democrats, the National Party or the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the cost of the scheme: 88c a week per child, says Senator Crowley. The South Australian Child Care Association says that its centres will have to put on two extra staff just to cope with the paperwork. There is $16 a week per child straight off. But the minister sticks to her guns and says 88c a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Child Care Association commissioned accountants to do the costing and they came up with an additional cost of $16, despite recent Queensland regulations implementing similar guidelines which have already bumped up their cost by around $30 a week. Eighty-eight cents a week, says the minister, backed up by a seven-week pilot study of 1.4 per cent of the centres' populations. The consultants, Pitcher and Partners, themselves acknowledge that the conclusions which can be drawn from the survey are limited by the relatively small sample. Further, four extreme cases which incurred significant unpaid hours were excluded from the final average costs estimate, with no rational explanation supplied other than the comment that they were difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Child Care Association also commissioned independent costings and found that its costs would rise from $40 to $69 a week per child, depending on the centre. `No', says the minister, `I am right and you are wrong. It is 88c a week'. We have pleaded with the minister, Senator Crowley, to appoint an independent arbitrator to work through the different costings and arrive at some common ground to make the thing work. I and the industry have suggested a number of times to the minister that she appoint a credible accountant such as Coopers and Lybrand to decide whether she is right or the child associations are right. Someone has got to be wrong. On the one hand, there are the minister's costings and, on the other hand, there are the four costings done by independent auditors saying that she is wrong. So we need a referee in the middle to decide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Association of Child Care Centres commissioned yet another cost study and came up with a cost increase of $35 a child per week to implement the accreditation scheme. At 88c a week, the minister is still hanging on like grim death to her flimsy costings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian association has also expressed its concern over the cost of implementing the accreditation scheme, particularly in the area of staffing. The minister still sticks to her 88c a week. Eighty-eight cents is the cost of about six minutes worth of labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that it is going to take only six minutes extra per week per child to make intimate diary notes of each child's behaviour and measure against an individually drawn-up program, to attend a variety of parent and staff meetings at overtime rates, and to attend, and be replaced while attending, additional in-service training&mdash;six minutes worth of staff time to complete paperwork for 52 principals. Then there is the translation and printing of numerous policy documents to be revised regularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some states the continuous care requirement of only one or two staff to look after the same child will necessitate alternative rosters and putting on more staff. Nevertheless, the minister says, `We are not concerned with staffing. That is a matter for the state'. She has said that to me numerous times in this place. What will the minister say to the states when they see their regulations and legislation being trampled upon by yet more Commonwealth interference? Where the essence of these guidelines goes to good quality child care, the states already have them covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is trying to place an umbrella over every aspect of child care. Not only that, she wants someone else to pay for it&mdash;the states, local government, the employees. I point out to Senator Chamarette and Senator Lees, who are obviously interested in the community organisations, that the non-profit organisations will have to pay for it. In fact, everyone will have to pay for it except the minister's department, because that would really blow her budget right out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of families in long day care receiving child-care assistance rose to 160,000 by the end of 1992-93, according to the department's annual report. In the end, of course, it is the parents who will be asked to pay the money and, eventually, it really will be the children who will have to pay. That is, 160,000 Australian families are going to be up for more in child-care costs. I bet the minister has not even consulted the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) over the likelihood of boosting fee relief by $30 per week per child; someone is going to have to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought this government was about creating more affordable and accessible child care. Commonwealth partnership arrangements with state, territory and local government, the private sector, employer and community groups are expected to result in 300,000 child-care places by 1996-1997. It may be possible to do that at 88c a week, but at $30 a week there is no chance. Will the minister be asking her state, local government, private and community partners to pay these extra costs? Have they agreed to absorb extra costs or will they be passed on to parents? Someone has to pay. The minister will be responsible for slamming the door on women who want to, or need to, enter the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This accreditation scheme threatens the government's estimate of child-care places and undermines the ability of women to re-enter the work force as it lowers affordability and accessibility of child care. The minister will be responsible for the rich getting child care and the poor getting nowhere. This accreditation scheme is the minister's own sandwich shop. Private child-care operators will have to work unpaid while the ALP sinks money into the scheme just to keep it going. In the end, are the sandwiches any better? Will the quality of child care be improved under such a scheme, or will it sink under the weight of detailed paperwork, and concern with the hole rather than the doughnut?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the nature of the program itself, it will not succeed while there is such a disparity between the government's and the industry's cost expectations. The child-care associations are only too happy to have their costings open to scrutiny; to sit down with an independent arbitrator and work them through. If the minister is at all interested in her scheme getting off the ground, surely this is the only sensible way. It will settle what is expected of care centres before the tonne of rules and regulations is turned into law. I am also confident that all participants in the provision of child-care services&mdash;the state, local government, employer groups and community groups, such as the Sydney Rescue Work Society&mdash;would like to see exactly what they are being committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the very important area of security of information. The National Childcare Accreditation Council is charged with administering the scheme. That will have access to incredibly detailed and sensitive information on children, parents, staff and the operation of the child-care centres. The government has said in the past how committed it is to ensuring privacy and security of information. How did it let this one slide past? There is probably no other group in Australia that holds such a diversity of sensitive information, yet there are no supporting secrecy provisions, no obligations or procedures to follow, cradle to the grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government wants to have information on 160,000 children in long day care centres from how often their nappies are changed, whether they have been abused or neglected, how much their parents earn, what the family situation is, disciplinary methods, what words they can say, what toys they can play with and so on. There are also records of staff interaction with parents. Then there are the commercial records of the child-care centres, all open to the NCAC, and all items of income and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must legislate for those tempted to ignore the sensitivity of the information they have access to. What will the NCAC do with all this information? Does it then pass it on to the education system so that it follows a child throughout its life? Some ill-informed comment at a preschool might form an incorrect attitude in teachers at a later stage. The point is that no-one knows what happens to this information, how much is stored and for how long, how it is to be stored and how it is to be collected. There are no privacy obligations or regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an intolerable situation which must not be allowed to happen. The Law Reform Commission identified this lack of protection in its October 1993 report on child-care legislation&mdash;or the lack of it, as it turns out. It has specified reference to the need for the NCAC to be bound by specific privacy provisions, yet the minister has carried on regardless. Whether the government tends to introduce such legislation later on is not for this Senate to ponder on or make any judgment about. We do that when we see the legislation. We must review legislation as it is laid out before us, not hypothesise about what might or might not be legislated at some future date. We are not Nostradamus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see before us today does not protect in any way the rights of Australians to be confident about the security of information that is passed on to a body like the NCAC. Our citizens' rights must be protected and secured before any such scheme comes into place. Each centre that registers with the NCAC must be confident that the NCAC is bound by privacy provisions. I know that this is a matter that the Democrats are concerned about. It has always been a major plank in their platform that privacy is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When asked a question by Senator Newman about the lack of privacy provisions, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this matter was brought to my attention in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> about the Australian Privacy Foundation's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an astonishing statement which reveals the minister's incredible naivety about her portfolio and legislative standards. Her statement reveals that she had never, before the article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, read the Australian Law Reform Commission's discussion paper on child care, specifically commissioned to propose wide-ranging legislative reform in her own portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public was expected to comment by 31 January this year. It seems that the minister is not required to comment until an issue is raised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The Law Reform Commission paper goes to great length to describe the need for greater protection of privacy. Yet the minister was ignorant, until this week, of its appraisal and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all the more astonishing because in a letter dated 10 December 1993 to the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances the minister refers to concerns held by the Law Reform Commission on the need for access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This letter was incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 15 December. I call on the minister to explain why she was aware of some of the Law Reform Commission's concerns and not others. How could the minister have remained in ignorance of such an important matter as privacy and protection of the very sensitive data which the NCAC will have access to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is the question of external review of decisions which significantly affect a child-care centre in its progress towards accreditation. This process is wide open to victimisation and harassment of individual care centres. Because of the open-ended nature of many of the guidelines, a centre might be following them but then, if a review or a moderator or someone at the NCAC bears the centre a grudge&mdash;and there are many grudges held by the NCAC members at present, particularly towards the private sector&mdash;that person could easily find something wrong with the centre or grade it lower at will, or perhaps give it only 12 months until the next review rather than three years. The centre has no redress outside the NCAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process can go on and the centre can be named in parliament twice without the centre being able to appeal or defend itself. By the time the minister makes the decision to cross the centre off the list, which is appealable under certain instances, it is too late for the centre, which could have been driven out of business or into bankruptcy by then anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Reform Commission made a number of recommendations regarding the need for external review. The minister went only part of the way when forced to amend the regulations as recommended by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. But the minister did not go too far out of the way to accommodate what the Law Reform Commission identified as necessary to bring the legislation up to scratch in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to understand why the minister is rushing through this inferior legislation. If she is going to do something, she should do it well. The Senate is in no position to depend on a minister's assurance that she will fix it up at a later date when she says that it will be all right on the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the minister should be subject to an accreditation system, too&mdash;one that includes daily diarising of her progress to a development plan, lots of in-service training and a 12-month review period. In light of the minister's inability to read a Law Reform Commission document integral to her own portfolio, I would suggest that she would find it difficult to get accreditation herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These child-care guidelines are riddled with a pox of impudence: impudent to impose such a costly regime on already financially overburdened Australian families; impudent to offer so little chance to appeal the decision of a non-government agency; and the height of impudence to attempt to gain the Senate's support without first putting in place privacy provisions to protect sensitive information given to the NCAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of principle for the Democrats. They will have to ask themselves whether they will stand up for their strongly held views that they pushed on privacy and that they fought for on the Australia card. Will they stand up for low-income mothers, the less affluent sector who would be unable to meet the extra cost for their child care? Will they use their balance of power to have an independent arbitrator to investigate the cost differences between the minister's 88c a week and the independent costings of the child-care associations? This is what Senator Kernot and Senator Lees will be judged on&mdash;how they used their balance of power in the Senate; whether they will make available to the Senate an independent judgment; or whether they will just blithely accept the minister's word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a big challenge to Senator Lees. I know of her concern for privacy. I just ask her to do the right thing and hope that she will make the decision that these guidelines be knocked out until a private investigation or a Senate committee calls for its own independent auditor to look at the costs and discern where the differences are, and also wait until the privacy matter has been legislated for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we go today, again, on an issue that we spent a lot of time on last year. Now we note that the ground certainly has changed away from Christmas carols and the banning of various sorts of toys and on to the issue, particularly of costings and of privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that all these issues should not be raised and are not relevant, but if we look back to last year we can see what was done to the guidelines by the opposition, how they were misrepresented and misquoted and what a long bow was drawn to suggest that somehow we were about to cancel Christmas. We do look with some concern now at the further claims that these guidelines are going to lead to exorbitant costs. Therefore, I am not going to go back over what we talked about last year. I believe we proved well and truly that the guidelines were being deliberately misrepresented. I will not be quoting large slabs of them for that purpose this time but will simply be going through two sets of costings that I have obtained, one, as has already been mentioned by a previous speaker, from Shaw and Gay Pty Ltd, and the other from Johnston and Rorke. I will then look at the issue of privacy which, as Senator Boswell has already said, is a matter of major concern for the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go first to the costings of Shaw and Gay. I do not want to suggest in any way that I am criticising the company involved; I am not. This is no reflection upon that company. It can work only with the information that it is given. It can rely only upon what it is told. The information was prepared from what the company refers to as its clientele base. I presume it is talking about the Child Care Association of Victoria, an organisation which represents one-third of the private centres in Victoria. I must stress here and remind senators that the major private child-care association in Victoria, the one headed by Mr David McAuliffe, has been very vocal in support of the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shaw and Gay also interviewed three&mdash;that is right, only three&mdash;proprietors who are not clients. The company did not interview staff; it did not go and talk to parents; it did not visit the centres. Shaw and Gay talked to three proprietors and I would argue that that is not a very solid base. I will actually go into these costings themselves. I will go through some of the items Shaw and Gay consider just need a small amount of money. These are not the big ticket items that I will deal with later. Where it says, `Staff interactions with children are warm and friendly', that is going to need a bit more money. `Staff treat all children equally and try to accommodate their individual needs'; that is going to need some more money. `Staff treat all children equally and try to accommodate their needs, both sexes treated without bias'; more money again. `Staff use a positive approach in guidance and discipline'; more money again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to ask: what are these three centres doing at the moment? We can go through this, item after item. These are small ticket items but we really do have to ask what the staff are doing now. Are we talking about centres that do not provide anything other than child minding? As we move on through this we see items that are starting to build up in cost. It says, `Staff learn some key words and phrases of the children's home language'. That is quite legitimate for a small cost, but here it is suggesting that we are going to have to send people off for special training. There is an initial 220 units, ongoing at 220 units a year, a total in any year of $502. Yes, it is fair enough to suggest that staff are going to have to do something here, but surely that is what I can best describe as an arbitrary claim for what will simply mean learning yes and no and perhaps some complimentary phrases like `Well done' in a child's home language. Some of that, hopefully, will already be part of what that centre has thought about, if it is in an area that has perhaps 50 per cent of its children from non-English speaking backgrounds, . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now get to the really big ticket item in this particular Shaw and Gay account. The guideline states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program incorporates learning experiences appropriate for each child, as indicated by individual development records maintained by the staff.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been costed at $60,221. If we go back to the guideline, to begin with there is no mention of a day-by-day record. It is being suggested here in the Shaw and Gay account that staff are actually going to have to do this almost every few minutes. What we actually see in the guidelines is that every week staff should closely observe some children during different activities and make a record of their levels of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good child-care centres now use the system of ticking boxes. They have sheets available with the child's name on the top and they simply monitor what the child does. Here this is extrapolated to a totally unrealistic amount of time. It is not a new item. It is already required under state guidelines; it is something that centres are already expected to do. So I do not expect that good centres will spend one cent more on being able to follow principle 17. I certainly do not accept, when we are looking at these costings, the $60,000 that has been added to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we get on to some of the smaller ticket items for which money has been added. `Toileting and nappy changing procedures meet individual needs and are positive experiences': they believe they are going to need more money for that. `Sleep time and dressing procedures meet individual needs for rest, comfort and self-help': again, they have costed in more money for that. What are the centres doing now? This brings me to a couple of the other larger ticket items. I go here to guideline 34 and I read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All staff are able and willing to observe signs of illness in children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suspected incidences of child abuse or neglect are reported to the appropriate authority through the centre coordinator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff know their legal and professional responsibilities in regard to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely we do not have centres out there with staff who do not know their legal responsibilities. In South Australia, all teachers and people who work with children have an obligation under the law to report child abuse. If staff do not know that now, who are these centres employing? In most states state regulations, if not state law, would have picked this up already; but here in these costings is a figure of $821 extra. They are suggesting a seminar for staff to know their legal and professional responsibilities in regard to this issue. Three hours for 12 staff is what the costing is based on. Surely any worthwhile proprietor would check that somebody was a trained child-care worker as a matter of course, before that person was employed. If the person did not know these responsibilities already, that would be part of the employer's responsibilities before the employee ever went into a situation where he or she was responsible for children. I simply cannot accept that these costings are anything like reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One costing with which I do agree is the one for item 32. I would question the amount, but certainly my experience is that some centres are not coping well with children with special needs. This particular costing is for $1,186 a year extra. I query that amount, but I would suggest that this is one of the positive things that will come out of these guidelines: that is, making sure centres in all states cope with and support kids who have special needs. That is one of the reasons the Democrats are supporting the guidelines. I do accept that there will be some additional responsibilities and extra money for a lot of centres there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us continue. `Staff encourage children to follow simple rules of hygiene' is costed as needing a bit more money. `Potentially dangerous products are inaccessible to children' is costed as needing more money. `Buildings and equipment are safe and hygienic'. What on earth is out there now? If we are talking about a standard of reasonable care now, we surely have to take out most of these extra items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at No. 47. This is the last one I will pick out as a specific example. What does No. 47 say?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are encouraged to complete a relevant first aid certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are encouraged to attend courses related to adult and child health issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet here they have gone so far as to suggest that staff are going to be required to go and get St John Ambulance certificates, costed at four staff for 32 hours each. That is nowhere in here. All it says is that they are `encouraged'. It does not make St John Ambulance certificates compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a physical education teacher, I had to have a St John Ambulance certificate. Without one, I was not allowed to teach in New South Wales. It was up to me to get it, and that was a requirement. There is no requirement in here but staff are encouraged to complete the relevant first aid certificate. I have not had time to look this up this morning but I suspect that in South Australia it is part of the state guidelines. I do not think it specifies St John Ambulance but it is simply a basic requirement. I think that a Red Cross course of a couple of hours or having a Red Cross manual on deck somewhere in the centre fulfils the requirement. These requirements have been costed at $7,500 per year. How that could possibly be read into principle 47 is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take out the two large-ticket items that I query and leave in all the bits and pieces, all those little odds and ends that it is thought the centres are not doing, such as changing nappies and looking after hygiene. If I do that, we are left with a costing that drops back to $5 per week per child. I argue that that is still too high. If a centre is at such a low standard now that it does not meet basic requirements or if a centre now meets basic requirements but wants to get itself up to a good standard, we are possibly looking at $2 to $3 for some of the things that may need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I question what some centres must be doing out there now. Do they have trained staff? I ask the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) whether she has any information as to how often the states are actually checking to see what is happening in some of these centres. If centres believe they have to go to these extraordinary lengths to meet basic standards, what is happening now? Are the states going out to make sure that the people who are looking after children are qualified and are not just childminders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to Johnston Rorke and the second lot of costings. This company is obviously a very reputable company and I do not want it to be suggested for a moment that I am criticising it. The company can only work with the information it has been given. It says right up-front that, if it has been given wrong information on the issue of food&mdash;that is, whether or not children actually get a meal in Queensland&mdash;its costings basically go out the window. On checking and on reading the guidelines, I find that the company certainly has been misinformed. It has costed in as its biggest ticket item, at $33,000, the need for meals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in these guidelines&mdash;I am referring to principle 24&mdash;that requires centres to provide meals. Some states already require that. Queensland does not. But that does not mean that in Queensland we have children starving between the hours of eight or nine o'clock in the morning and four or five o'clock at night. I refer to my colleague Senator Kernot for information as to what now happens in Queensland, as her daughter went to a couple of centres in Queensland. Either centres are providing meals and have already built the costs into their fees or they are not providing meals but the children bring packed lunches from home. Whether or not they are now providing meals or the children have packed lunches, all of these requirements can be quite easily met. For example, good-quality care means that mealtimes are pleasant occasions for all. Surely that is not too much to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take from these costings the big-ticket item of $33,000, which is not needed, we then come to the next big-ticket item, which is that a daily timetable is planned to reflect children's needs, abilities and interests. Again I have to ask what they are doing now if they do not have this. It is a state regulation in Queensland. Indeed, on this document it says `existing Queensland regulation, yes'. So there again we take out a large item of $12,750. If we take only two items out of this series of costings we bring the figure back from $59,000 per year for a centre of 65 kids to $45,000, and that brings it down to $5 per week. That $5 per week is for centres that are not even meeting basic requirements now; in other words, centres that should have already been picked up by the state authorities, centres that should not now be allowed to continue to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I request the minister to ask her state colleagues, particularly in Queensland, whether they are checking the child-care centres now. Perhaps I can put some specific questions. How often is each centre in Queensland visited? When those visits occur, what in particular are the priorities for checking? It seems to me that, if child-care centres really believe they have to do these things, there are some very big questions to be answered as to what is happening to the kids now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now need to move on to the other issue, that is, privacy. I have had a number of discussions on this issue with a variety of individuals, and we certainly do have a problem. It is not a problem, I hasten to say, that will mean that we scuttle these regulations and start again, but it is certainly a problem that is going to have to be monitored. We are still waiting for several answers from the minister as to what precisely will be done and which particular path will be followed. Are we looking at a company structure? What particular measure are we going to get to make sure that there are no problems with privacy? We need to know, for example, whether the council is subject to the Privacy Act, something that I understand the minister has already been researching. I look to her speech in a few moments to sum up this debate for information on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the council is developing a code of ethics for reviewers. Will we be able to see that code? When will it be available? Also, we need to see what legal sanctions will be brought in if, indeed, there are breaches of privacy. What particular measures will be taken against those people who in any way breach privacy guidelines and privacy procedures? I wait with interest to hear what the minister has to say on that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees has already given us excellent examples of reasons why this new argument about costings is insufficient to support a disallowance motion. However, I will briefly summarise why the Greens will not be supporting this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees said, the companies, regardless of their competence and their best will in the world to provide efficient and effective costings, are reliant solely on the information they have been given. If there is a difference in interpretation that underlies the information they are given, the costings can vary considerably. These differences in the costings we have been provided with by the minister and in the costings from the other private child-care agencies and associations illustrate the well-known principle of demand characteristics. It is obvious that the different motivations underlying the request allowed for the different information and different implications of the guidelines and have led to widely discrepant results. Both may well represent extremes in motivation and both approaches in essence are hypothetical, because they are looking in advance at a system that may or may not operate in the way in which it is predicted. So I am not at this point going to defend either the costings provided by the minister, on the one hand, or the more expensive costings we have had made available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am grateful that all the people involved have made the effort to look in that detail at those implications, the position the Greens hold is that the only appropriate way to assess it is to accept the guidelines on their merits and then to make a realistic review of the complications that may arise. Because it is a new system, it will not be perfect. It may well have costings that nobody today has even dreamt of, and it is fair to say that it could be putting people in a new situation that deserves to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we regard the much higher costings as being anywhere near correct, it would, as Senator Lees has already indicated, be an indictment of the present facilities that are available for child care in our community. I believe that that is a very serious point. Is the opposition really saying that improvement in child care is too expensive for us, or that these incredible increases in costings do not reflect the fact that some basic problems exist in what we are already providing for the children of our society? This is the fifth different reason that has been given&mdash;the fifth that I know of; there are probably far more&mdash;by opponents of the government's child-care accreditation scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, there were the complaints about the guidelines, and I must say to Senator McGauran that there is room for improvement and criticism of those guidelines. Nobody has said that they will be perfect. However, I have looked at them, and they appear to put, in a fairly repetitive fashion, the very basic requirements any parents would expect if they were putting their children into the care of such centres for any length of time. So that concern about the guidelines was the first one. That does need to be addressed.

That argument has already been thrashed out at considerable length and I will not go into it here, but that was another one. The position the Greens held at that point was that, if the government is providing fee assistance, there would be something wrong if the only kind of accountability they demanded was simply a facts and figures one, and not one that took account of the quality of child care that was being provided. I believe that accountability factor is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next reason was the intrusion of parents into the management of child-care centres. I believe that this created concern that it might involve greater participation in the programming or management in some way of the child-care centres. But the Greens believe that it is excellent to encourage the involvement of parents. Sometimes child-care centres offer an extremely valuable service where parents cannot provide the kind of care the children need, and it should not be underestimated. However, where the child-care centres can actually incorporate parents into their work, the children can only benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage was the privacy intrusion. As Senator Lees has said, this is a matter that deserves to be checked out. I have already contacted the office of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I have heard Quentin Bryce of the National Childcare Accreditation Council speaking of the willingness there is to look at any matters of privacy, which appear to be very limited, that may relate to concerns of the Privacy Commissioner. While Senator Boswell referred earlier to the concerns he and the Democrats have over privacy and the protection of confidentiality, it has to be recognised that looking after children is one of the most important tasks of our community. They are our future. When it is considered that one child in three has been abused before the age of 18 and that we do get earlier and earlier reporting of childhood violence and bullying, it can be seen that there may be some reason why this area could be of concern. However, there is no evidence that these guidelines, or any of the ways in which the scheme is being implemented, will actually assist us in that regard. I do think that is one reason why people could be concerned. However, my view would be for greater transparency, rather than greater secrecy, in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next reason that was brought up, and I think this was the final one we are discussing today, is how it is to the economic disadvantage of the owners and managers of child-care centres. I have omitted the Christmas carols because I felt that fell within the complaints about the guidelines and was not really worthy of response. But maybe, with this series of different reasons for opposing it, we are getting closer to the truth, which may unfortunately lie in the practices within our community in running child-care centres. As a parliament, we should be aware that there may be a lack of concern for the way in which child-care centres are administered, staffed and run, because we have for a long time been blind to the importance of our responsibilities in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My belief, and that of my colleague, is that the way in which the quality of child care is supervised is actually more important than the kind of educational standards we impose on university and tertiary level education. Nobody queries that there should be accountability regarding quality of standards there. However, it is a recent innovation by the government that we are imposing standards of quality assessment on a fairly new and burgeoning section of our community. There is nobody to blame here, but we must be careful not to react in a very conventional and conservative way to something that is greatly needed and is long overdue. We need to provide guidelines for the quality of child care so that we will be protecting and safeguarding the welfare and well-being of the children of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by saying that the Greens will not support the disallowance motion. We believe there has been an undertaking by the minister to conduct a full review of the improved system before July 1995, which I understand is after a year of operation. That seems to me a sensible time to assess whether it has any serious problems. I am sure that there has been a willingness expressed that, along the way, if problems occur they will be dealt with. Basically, the need is for good quality child care, for accountability for government funding, and for concern that damage caused by poor quality child care is difficult to reverse and is unacceptable both in the short and long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will not be supporting this motion. We believe there will be need for further refinement of the scheme. We have had extensive consultation with both people who support the scheme and have been very eager for its introduction and also those who have expressed concerns, many of which I have mentioned very briefly. I apologise if I have not done those concerns justice. I believe there is a kernel of truth in every concern people raise, but I think we do have to look at the central principle, which is that these guidelines are being introduced for the best. There is a considerable overreaction to them that I do not understand. I believe the opponents have not justified their arguments. Therefore, with the qualification that I believe it is important that a review be conducted before July 1995 and that it involve the elected National Childcare Accreditation Council and other bodies, with broad representation of all affected parties, we will be supporting the government's introduction of the guidelines and not the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very sad today to hear both the Democrats and the Greens say that they will not support the coalition on this important matter of disallowing these guidelines on child care. Unfortunately, I was not present during the debate before Christmas due to my illness. I felt very frustrated at not being able to take part in what I see as a major issue in Australia, the care of Australia's children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette was quite rightly talking about quality. I could not agree more that the focus of all our attention should be on quality. The coalition does support quality in child care. Equally, it believes that there is currently a regulatory system in place in each state of Australia which is responsible for the overview and for the management of child-care centres. I think it was Senator Lees who said that, if that was not being done properly, the Commonwealth government had some sort of leadership role in pointing the finger at those states that were not fulfilling their legal responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard Senator Crowley on several occasions talk about Australia having the best child-care system in the world. If she as the minister responsible talks, on the one hand, about the best child-care service in the world being that which we enjoy in Australia, how can she, on the other hand, suggest that the states are so derelict in their responsibility to ensure good quality child care in our country that the Commonwealth must come in over the top and introduce yet another regulatory system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Crowley will say, `Aha, but this is not exactly the same'. No, it is not exactly the same, but there is considerable overlap and there certainly is an additional cost. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the debate about the costs, there clearly will, and must, be an increase in costs as a result of yet another level of requirements being imposed on the child-care centres of Australia. One has only to look at the document setting out the principles to see that child-care centres can either have an unsatisfactory response to a principle, a basic response, or they can have a good quality or high quality response. We are all very pleased that the higher they aim, the better for our children, but there are going to be occasions when people are not necessarily going to have what these guidelines say is the basic standard. They may have a different standard which is just as good and maybe even better, but it does not fit the exact wording and the requirements under these principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular concern, having a small business background, at a requirement which is said to be basic that staff and parents are permitted to attend meetings of a child-care centre. I can understand where this came from: it clearly came from people who have spent their lives in the public sector. People who have worked in the public sector all their lives have no understanding of how a small business operates, or the need for privacy in relation to the intimate details of the operation of a small business. How would the local cake shop like it if its clients and staff were to be permitted to attend all meetings of the business?</PARA>

It does not matter that 60 per cent of Australia's child-care provision is not in the government sector. These quite unrealistic requirements are being imposed upon the private or the non-government sector. That is just the basic requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to good quality, which is the next one up, staff and parents shall have elected representatives on any relevant management committees. Tell that to the cake shop proprietor. Why should the child-care centre proprietor not have just as much concern about that as the cake shop proprietor? We are not talking about the regulation, which is already under way by the states, of Australia's child-care centres. We are talking about an additional level of supervision and surveillance being required by the Commonwealth in which these many onerous requirements are being imposed on the non-government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees acknowledged that she did have worries about privacy, as did Senator Chamarette, but they were both prepared to allow these regulations to go through. I find that incredible. After all, the Senate, if anywhere, should be the place where people express concerns about the privacy of the citizen. This is a place designed to protect the rights of the citizen. Surely the right to privacy has to be around the top of the list in terms of citizens' rights. Yet we find that child-care centres and, presumably, the parents who send their children there, are likely to have serious problems in the protection of their privacy. That is not just the coalition saying so; it is also the Law Reform Commission saying so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley, in response to my question on Tuesday, gave some assurances, and I am very glad that she has. But I say to the minister that I have been here for eight years, and I have seen ministers' assurances come and go. Frankly, I am not all that impressed until I see them in writing. When the minister is taking regulations through this chamber for the government and is not prepared to put privacy regulations in with them, I have my doubts about her assurances. I would have thought that if the minister were really genuine she would have held them over. Time is on her side; she has until 1 July this year before this all becomes a requirement. I find her attitude to this pretty cavalier, and the attitude of the Greens and the Democrats was very disappointing. I want to make it quite clear exactly what the Law Reform Commission did say. In paragraph 4.19 of its report it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System begins operating, the National Childcare Accreditation Council. . . will hold information about long day care centres including</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.how staff, children and parents interact</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.whether a service has met or made progress against the accreditation standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NCAC is an incorporated association. It is not a government agency. Provisions that protect information from disclosure by Commonwealth agencies or individual Commonwealth officers do not apply. If a member or employee of the Council were to disclose information without authority the only legal remedies available to a service would be those offered by the common law, for example, the law of defamation or contract. However, the effectiveness of common law remedies is limited by the cost and delay of litigation, the inappropriate nature of the remedies and the fact that the service may often be unaware that the information is being misused.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Reform Commission concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interests of services could be further protected if the Council was subject to clearly defined secrecy obligations requiring that the information supplied to the council by services must be collected, used, stored and disclosed in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of the information.</PARA>
<PARA>These issues should be dealt with before the regulations go through. I find it incredible that apparently, as the minister acknowledged in answer to my question on Tuesday, she did not have any knowledge of this matter until she read about it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this week. She has an office devoted to child care. Where were they, and was she not asking the right questions, or are they incompetent? Where was her attention to her own portfolio responsibilities, when she had a Law Reform Commission report that dealt with child care, that she was not of her own volition doing a little homework? I am concerned that the minister obviously is relying on people who are incompetent and who do not tell her anything. The fact is that she has not the wit to ask questions herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She gave assurances, as she said. I am not all that impressed with the assurances. Also, in her answer she makes it quite clear that the Privacy Commissioner himself has been concerned. She said that the Privacy Commissioner has had discussions with the council and is meeting with it. That does not mean to say that it is fixed. That means to say that the Privacy Commissioner is still in the process of trying to do something about this mess the minister has got into through her indecent haste in trying to get these regulations through the Senate. Surely, if the minister has any respect for the Senate, as well as for the rights of Australians, she should be willing voluntarily to hold these regulations off until this matter is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the minister had been long enough in the Senate to realise that the privacy of citizens is something this Senate should guard jealously. As the minister responsible, she is now knowingly putting in jeopardy the privacy of citizens' private information. She has the opportunity and she has the knowledge now. She can do something about it. All we are asking is that she hold these things over until satisfactory regulations go through which do protect the child-care centres and the people who use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth went very carefully and very effectively through our concerns over the costs of accreditation, and Senator Boswell has also addressed the very serious threat to privacy that these guidelines represent. I want to talk more generally about the implications of accreditation for those who have most to lose from its compulsory implementation, that is, the parents and children. It is unfortunate that the coalition has been forced to pursue this motion because, given the clearly unresolved issues associated with the guidelines&mdash;in particular, the cost and privacy implications&mdash;any responsible government and any minister with an ounce of credibility would have sought to have the guidelines withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister knew that she would have had coalition support for such action to withdraw if she had decided to take that action. Even at this eleventh hour, I still call on her to do so. Instead, she is persisting with this set of guidelines, which are seriously flawed. She did acknowledge, as I said this week, that the guidelines are a source of concern to the Privacy Commissioner and to the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go any further, I would like to place on the record my absolute rejection of the views relating to the guidelines and accreditation which were attributed to me last year by Senator Crowley in my absence, while I was in a hospital bed. On 24 November last year, in answering a question from Senator Denman, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman made it clear in this place that she supports accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, during the same question time, in answer to a question from Senator McGauran, Senator Crowley said, referring to members of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they care to check, they will find that Senator Newman supports accreditation and so do most of the people involved in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, during the same question time, this time answering a question from Senator Boswell, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suggest again that those opposite look at what Senator Newman has said about this matter. She is in support of accreditation and that would be a very thoughtful approach for the opposition to take.</PARA>
<PARA>I watched Senator Crowley in that question time from my hospital bed, and I cannot say she did too much for the monitor in my ICU ward. I had Senator Herron contacted, and he put on the record my real position on the accreditation guidelines put forward by the government. I also had a press release put out under my name on 24 November. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, "disgracefully misled the Senate today" when she claimed that Senator Newman supported the government's compulsory Child Care accreditation program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman has consistently voiced opposition to Senator Crowley's "heavy handed attempts at social engineering" and takes particular exception to Senator Crowley's "untruthful account of her position". </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 26th October 1993 Senator Newman released a press statement stating that: ". . . the Coalition is committed to quality child care, voluntary accreditation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley should note that: `voluntary accreditation'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the central role of parental choice in determining quality of care for children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Newman is "appalled" that she would be so blatantly misrepresented by a fellow senator while she is absent from the chamber and ill in hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite that clear and unambiguous repudiation of Senator Crowley's claims, she misrepresented me again, this time on 7 December. In answering a question from Senator McGauran she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to ask again&mdash;why Senator McGauran, in speaking on behalf of the opposition, is opposed to accreditation when Senator Newman supports it.</PARA>
<PARA>My position and that of the opposition is quite clear, and I hope this puts Senator Crowley's distortions of the truth to bed. I do not support the guidelines put forward by Senator Crowley, including aspects of the 52 principles and the fact that her system of accreditation is compulsory. The minister frequently denies that the accreditation system is compulsory; but in fact that is absolutely true, because any child-care centre that does not go through with accreditation will incur loss of eligibility for fee relief for all its parents. I cannot think of anything more effectively compulsory than that. Sadly, the guidelines will most hurt those who can least afford to pay for child care. The effect will vary from state to state because of variations in state regulations. I asked Senator Crowley a question the other day, and in her answers in question time she got herself totally confused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not very unusual. I wonder whether she is permanently confused over this issue or, to be kind to her, whether it was a momentary aberration. She had great difficulty in understanding why there should be differences in the calculations of the extra costs that accreditation would impose, why there should be variations from state to state. It is a pretty important point, but the minister responsible seems to have a little trouble understanding the maths of the thing and the impact of her actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accreditation is going to lead to increased costs largely, but not entirely, because of staff demands and differences in staff ratios. Child-care centres will have to hire more staff in order to meet the principles set out in the handbook. Staffing requirements under state regulations already vary from state to state&mdash;perhaps the honourable senator has not woken up to that. Therefore, coming from different staff bases, the final costs associated with accreditation are going to be different in different states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of all this is that an increase in costs will impact most harshly on low income earners. Either parents will have to pay higher fees to keep their children in an accredited centre or they will have to take their children out of formal care altogether. So, while the government claims to be setting out to improve the quality of child care via these guidelines, by linking accreditation to fee relief the effect will be just the opposite. As parents are effectively forced to leave the formal sector, there will be an offsetting greater use of the informal sector, a sector which the government claims provides a lower standard of care. The consequences for low income earners, I believe, will be devastating. I do not want to labour the point, but I do point out that that view is supported by the private child-care sector and the not-for-profit sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has sneered in the past that only a few private child-care centres are opposed to this legislation. Whether she is living in a fool's paradise or whether that is the advice given to her and the department knows no better, I cannot judge, but I can tell Senator Crowley, with all the facts that are at my disposal, that she is seriously misguided. The opposition to her guidelines and to the compulsory accreditation system is very strong and very widespread across Australia. More than any other sector, the not-for-profit sector is concerned for lower paid and vulnerable parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard today about the Sydney Rescue Work Society. It is a not-for-profit group of people who come from church backgrounds. It provides care for 1,500 children per day in metropolitan Sydney. That society has long had concerns with the compulsory nature of accreditation and the effects of increased costs. Representatives of the society have met with the coalition, with me, with the Australian Democrats, with the Greens and with the government. It is a widely respected, thoroughly credible organisation. It deals primarily with lower paid, disadvantaged parents. In a letter sent to all members of parliament on 15 November last year, the society argued that the guidelines should be rejected. The reasons for this position include that linkage of child-care assistance to accreditation will deny many needy families access to child care; that the costs will rise and the affluent will be insulated from the increases because they will be the main beneficiaries of the government's child-care rebate; and that most of the industry opposes the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the minister listens to this. The Sydney Rescue Work Society says that most of the industry opposes the proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks on the government response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the Australian environment and tourism. The government response to this report has taken 18 months to arrive. That is not unusual in this place, but I regret to say that I find it totally inadequate. Of the committee's 31 recommendations, just 12 have been accepted by the government; and most of those recommendations that have been accepted are simply those which preserve the status quo. Eleven recommendations have been rejected and eight are under consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate report covered two vital issues in the development of Australia's tourism potential. The first was the effect of tourism on the local physical and social environment. People care about this in places where they live; when proposals come along which impact on their lives, they care about it. Secondly, the committee looked at the impact of foreign investment on the tourism industry. I have to say that on both of these major issues the government response is nothing more than a cop-out or a squib of a response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally unacceptable that the government has refused to consider strengthening its environmental impact statements to include the social impact. When one sees the massive social effects that a growing influx of tourists has had on communities, such as at Byron Bay in New South Wales and at Cairns in northern Queensland, the straight-out rejection of the committee's key recommendations on evaluating the social impact of new development I find appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more galling is the government's rejection of key recommendations to bring some reason and sanity back into the consideration of applications for foreign investment in tourism. The committee report found the current consideration of foreign investment applications by the Foreign Investment Review Board to be inadequate. The committee report calls for clearer criteria to identify the impact, particularly the social impact, of foreign investment and to identify its likely economic benefits, if any. The report calls for a restructuring of the FIRB to make it more independent, particularly of Treasury. It calls for the Foreign Investment Review Board to require progress reports on developments. It calls for the Foreign Investment Review Board to have sufficient resources to do its job and for its decisions to be based on proper market and economic material. I am not on this committee, but these are things that I have been saying for quite some time. But all of these recommendations have been rejected by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the report is consistent with longstanding Democrats' policy. We support foreign investment as long as it is demonstrated to be clearly in the public interest. Our policy goes further than the report. We favour joint ventures between Australian and overseas investors, and we favour majority Australian ownership. We want to make sure that Australians are able to obtain the benefits of market access and technology transfer from a foreign partner, without ceding national economic sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adoption of this Senate committee report by the government would have gone a long way towards our policy goal of assuring the Australian people that a loss of ownership of part of their economy would deliver a real benefit to the community. The current Foreign Investment Review Board process provides no such assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state of Queensland there has been massive public concern about foreign investment in tourism. Virtually all of the international hotels in Cairns are foreign owned, as is much of Surfers Paradise. Even Brisbane's oldest wildlife sanctuary, Lone Pine, is now in foreign hands. The government has decided to deny people who live in these communities the assurance that projects will be approved only if there is an economic and social benefit to the community. Such a small ask, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the four years to 1992, applications for investment in tourism was the third largest category considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board after real estate and mining.

Two-thirds of the 3,000 applications approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board in 1991-92 were approved with conditions attached, but the catch is that the Foreign Investment Review Board has no staff, or has insufficient staff with insufficient time actually to follow up the conditions that were imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Mr Keating as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, the ability of the Foreign Investment Review Board properly to consider the economic and social benefits of foreign investment has been progressively clipped. Foreign Investment Review Board staff reductions have reduced the time spent considering each application. In the 1980s, each staff member considered about 35 applications annually. In 1991 to 1992, that rose to 160. So that is 35 to 160. In 1992 to 1993, it rose again to 250. So that is 35 to 250. I do not think the government can assert that it is the public's interest that is being protected when less and less time is being spent on considering applications and no time is being spent on following up the conditions attached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a surprise it is that the government should reject the key recommendation of the committee, that the Foreign Investment Review Board should be independent of Treasury and provide independent advice. The very few times the Foreign Investment Review Board has displayed such independence and recommended against applications, such as Mr Conrad Black's original application for John Fairfax, it has been overridden by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Senate select committee tomorrow will be looking at the Conrad Black case. We will look at the Foreign Investment Review Board's processes and the relationship between it and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the people of Cairns, of the Gold Coast, of Byron Bay and of other communities which have expressed strong concern about the level of foreign investment in their communities will take the government to task over this appalling response. I look with interest to see the opposition's foreign investment policy. I notice that it is having a review of its current policies. I think that primary in our consideration should be ensuring that the interests of Australian people are represented in foreign investment decisions, not just the wishes of entrepreneurs and malleable politicians. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="332" SPEAKER="Woodley Sen J." NAMEID="HX5" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the domestic meat premises charge and the export inspection charge regulations which have been tabled in the House of Representatives and are due to be tabled in the Senate shortly. The tabling of these regulations completes the introduction of the two-tier charging system for various meat establishments. It was and is part of a package of reforms undertaken by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. We supported this legislation and certainly support the regulations as well, but I want to put on record some concerns we have that we have discussed with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins. I am very thankful that he is willing to take on board our concerns and has already acted to do something about that. What I want to do today is simply to record the concerns that we have so that we can ensure that those concerns are on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the legislation was designed as a reform of AQIS, to reduce the cost to industry by providing a more efficient inspection service and at the same time maintaining the integrity of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the introduction of a two-tier charging regime, other changes to be undertaken by AQIS include the shedding over the next three or four years of some 750 AQIS staff. I want to encourage the minister in this because I am sure that is not going to be easy to do or to achieve. But we would encourage him in that, and certainly would encourage the industry to adopt quality assurance practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provided for AQIS to impose a per premises charge on meat establishments in those states where it is responsible for the inspection service. Thus, the new two-tier charging regime was comprised of the old inspection charge, which is now set at a level that more directly reflects the cost of AQIS providing a field inspection service, and a newly-introduced&mdash;and I think this is the one where there is some debate&mdash;registration charge designed to recover the cost of maintaining administrative support to that field service. This is the new regime that we are faced with, and it is here that I want to raise some concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs last year we heard that the overall effect of the reforms being undertaken in AQIS would mean a reduction in the cost of inspection service to the industry of some 20 per cent. I believe, from talking with the executive members of AQIS, that they are certainly going to achieve that. But on the way there have been some problems which I want to refer to, for the new charging levels strongly favour large operators: with more inspectors on their premises, they are far better able to offset the new registration fee, a registration fee which for most categories of establishment will be the same regardless of the size of individual operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few weeks I have received a number of letters from the smaller and medium-sized meat establishments highlighting the problems that they have had with the increases that they are now facing with this new system. Let me give a couple of examples. One small export sausage casing plant in Tasmania will see a reduction of its inspection fees of just $17 a year, accompanied by the introduction of a registration fee of $7,740 as of 1 January this year, a fee which will rise to $9,500 in July this year and then rise once again to $12,700 on 1 July 1995. This operation employs 16 local people and the effect of an increase in annual charges from $770 to over $8,000 could be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is that of a small independent export boning room in my home state of Queensland which employs 25 people whilst in full production. This company has been in operation for just 12 months and will see its AQIS bill go from around $77,000 for its first year of operation to around $110,000. In that first year this firm produced about 27,000 head of cattle and exported over 3,200 tonnes. In reference to the $35,000 registration fee that it must now pay, the company points out in its letter that, if it were to employ 400 extra people and produce 20 times the output, its registration charge would still be the same. I need to perhaps point out here, as the minister has indicated to me, that, if we had gone for the three-tier system as it had been proposed by the government, the company's concerns would have been covered. But the industry advice we received was that a two-tier system was preferred, and so we are now faced with this very problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original legislation was being dealt with by the committee I, along with several witnesses, raised this issue of the differential effect the new charges would have on small operators. To its credit, in response to those concerns the government agreed to broaden the number of establishment categories and, specifically, to introduce a lesser level of charge for those domestic abattoirs with fewer than three food service officers. This was a very welcome concession for the domestic abattoirs. However, it made no provision for the operators of all those other types of establishment, including those of which I have just given examples and which are now coming to me with their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, when I consulted the previous minister's office, the response I got was that the effect on the smaller operators was not a concern for the industry bodies. It seems to me that those industry bodies either did not fully comprehend the effect the charges were going to have or they may not have been representing the interests of the small to medium sized firms within the industry very well at all. I am not sure which it is; perhaps it is a bit of both. At the committee inquiry I raised concerns over the smaller operators. One of the responses I got from the director of AQIS stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no intention in this legislation to use it as a device for restructuring the industry. That has to be considered in the light of the Industry Commission report. There is absolutely no intention to do that.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that the director was very genuine. But the problem is that the quite unintended result of what AQIS is now doing in the restructuring of AQIS is that, in reality, that may be the very effect that it will have on the smaller and medium sized operators. The larger operators will simply absorb the registration fee and offset it through the reduction in inspection fees, but the smaller operators will not have the opportunity to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that these are small businesses, primarily Australian owned, employing local labour in our rural and regional areas, and that they are doing their best to contribute to our level of exports. These firms will not be able to wear the sorts of increases in AQIS charges that these regulations will impose. I want to put on record to all of those in the meat industry that the Democrats are concerned about the possible forcing out of smaller operators. I assure the government and the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, that we will be looking to work with them and the opposition to avoid this outcome at all costs. Preliminary conversations with the minister indicate that he is aware of our concerns and is willing to act to ensure that smaller operators will not be destroyed by these charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right, we did warn.

It is important to note that Senator Baume did pick this up and tried to get an explanation, albeit unsuccessfully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Michael Baume" NAMEID="LE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, through the Senate estimates committee system, and there was just absolute and utter stonewalling. I think we have now seen the magnitude of what Senator Baume was talking about at that time and, with further and further examination of it, the closer we get to it the more clearly we see how this was politically manipulated to the ends of the Labor Party, to ensure that some of the electorates that were recipients of this money were favoured so positively by Minister Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also gives an interesting indication of how the government believed that it already had some voters in its pockets. When saying that, I refer to the seat of Fremantle. The seat of Fremantle has been traditionally a very safe Labor seat, but over recent elections Labor's majority in the seat of Fremantle has slipped and slipped and slipped. In the recent ones it has slipped by over five per cent. Yet this is a seat that has been held by the Treasurer of a Labor government and, therefore, taken for granted. Figures from the Auditor-General show that the seat of Fremantle received $225,350 under the sports rorts&mdash;less than any other federal Labor-held seat in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The degree of electoral bribe was much less, as I say, in Fremantle than anywhere else; and that just typifies the way in which this government operates. Its grant to the seat of Stirling, I have to say, was not all that flash, either, because it had given up hope of winning the seat of Stirling&mdash;absolutely given that away. The seat of Fremantle has some very needy areas within it that just got nothing. In the light of further admissions by the federal minister, Ros Kelly, that she was responsible for selecting the $30 million worth of projects, I think it is ironic that Fremantle was put a poor last behind the rest of Western Australia's Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the look of these figures, winning the seat appeared to be seen as some lay-down misere whereby the government did not have to worry. Labor could take the people of Fremantle for granted and politically target the funds at seats such as Swan, which were hanging, and still hang, in the balance. Of course, with the recent announcement that the current member for Swan, Kim Beazley, will be going to the seat of Brand, the people of Swan have seen the last of any money from this federal Labor government. Quite clearly, it is now throwing Swan away and Swan will get the same treatment as any of the other seats that were not considered winnable by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me draw the distinction with some of the other seats. The seat of Perth, for example, which was contested and won by Stephen Smith, the former adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Labor Party apparatchik, received over double the amount of money&mdash;$604,035&mdash;that was allocated to Fremantle. Why? It was a new candidate who needed support&mdash;`Let us make sure we win it'. The Liberal Party had a very good candidate in that seat and Labor knew that it was going to be a very tough seat to win. So what did it do? It poured money into it. Mr Beazley's seat, the Federal Finance Minister's seat, the seat of Swan, received a staggering $317,000 more than Fremantle. That is not surprising because, as I have said before, it is an increasingly marginal Labor seat. The seat of Brand received $432,673 and the seat of Canning got $406,592. The latter, being held by the Assistant Treasurer, George Gear, also received vastly more funding than Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average value of grants given to Labor-held seats was $257,000, but Fremantle received $31,650 less than the average Labor seat in Australia and $100,650 less than the average Labor marginal seat. It is quite clear that Fremantle has been totally and utterly given the flick by this government, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the next few weeks. Only 5.7 per cent of the $3.9 million Mrs Kelly decided to give to Western Australian electorates went to Fremantle. Amid the scandalous mishandling of this major public expenditure by Mrs Kelly, which saw the biggest grants going to five Labor-held seats in Western Australia, Fremantle was just left out in the cold as not being important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more appalling is the fact that Fremantle people will never know why they did not get a level of funding similar to that of other Western Australian Labor electorates. In her inimitable mishandling of this whole affair, Mrs Kelly has admitted that few records on allocating the grants were kept or even made. It is beyond comprehension how any minister can start dishing out public money&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;and not keep a record. It is not only me and all my colleagues who cannot understand this, but the people of seats such as Fremantle, who will never know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor-held seat of Kalgoorlie fared a lot better than Fremantle&mdash;as, of course, did every other Labor seat. Kalgoorlie picked up $375,200 under Mrs Kelly's sports rorts program. Some towns in the Kalgoorlie electorate did relatively well out of the grants; but when it comes to some of the areas in the Kalgoorlie electorate, Mrs Kelly should look at her claim that she has allocated this money as a `needs based' funding source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Australian Bureau of Statistics survey has found that there are dramatically varying levels of affluence and poverty in the goldfields; but this Labor government does not worry about that, because once again Kalgoorlie is a seat it holds. It is a seat it does not fear it will lose while it puts up with a member like Graeme Campbell speaking against the Prime Minister and against Labor Party policy on every issue. The survey found that the towns of Wiluna and Menzies and the trans-Australian railway communities were amongst the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas in Western Australia. Did it matter to Mrs Kelly? Did it matter to any of the ministers in dishing out public money? No, it has not mattered to them at all. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kalgoorlie Miner</EMPHASIS> newspaper this week quoted Goldfields Esperance Development Authority director Rob Walster as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you live in Menzies you choose not to work. The only thing that keeps Menzies going as a town is that people choose to live there for historical reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>This Labor government has simply left many of those goldfields towns out to dry, and that is it. It has just left them there. Towns like Wiluna and Menzies and the trans-Australian railway communities were very conveniently forgotten, in spite of their socio-economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this Labor government treating people in Labor's own seats so poorly? While Mrs Kelly was handing out the $315,000 in her own affluent electorate, many of the people in Wiluna, Menzies and the trans-Australian railway communities were, and still are, living on the bottom rung of the ladder. Does this Labor government worry? No. She handed out money in her own electorate, and even in her own electorate many people believe that that was improper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly should be made to go to places like Wiluna and Menzies and other communities in rural Australia. She does not bother to go anywhere where there is not a camera flashgun going off somewhere or a television microphone that can be conveniently put at her mouth. It is often said about Mrs Kelly that she will hear a biro click and smile because she thinks a photograph is being taken of her. Why does she not get out to some of these electorates? Why does she not get out to some of these towns which are in the same shocking socio-economic position as Wiluna and Menzies, and explain her own slipshod funding priorities and the way taxpayers' money has been used and distributed by the federal government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of desperately needy communities which could use the $100,000 Mrs Kelly gave to the ACT Touch Football Association for an office, creche and meeting room. I am not saying that that particular group did not need money. What I am saying is that some of these disadvantaged communities need special attention. But because the government thinks it has got their votes&mdash;though, believe me, many of these people do not vote Labor&mdash;and because it holds the seat, they suddenly become unimportant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories presided over a most morally corrupt financial scam which, as we said earlier, Senator Baume tried to alert this parliament to some two years ago. Even in her haste to give the majority of the money to Labor electorates, Mrs Kelly ignored the traditional Labor voters. The traditional Labor voters I now refer to, of course, are those in Fremantle and particularly Kalgoorlie. She left them last when handing out grants to Labor seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be interesting to watch is how many of the ministers go and unlock their departmental bank accounts and start handing out money to the seat of Fremantle now that a by-election is going to be held in that seat. It is by no means a lay-down misere for the Labor Party. No matter what they think of Dr Lawrence, she led the Labor Party to a devastating defeat in Western Australia last year. We will now see federal ministers, making up for the fact that there is no state government to pork-barrel Fremantle, doing it from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure this parliament that many of us will be watching very closely how much money is poured from federal taxpayers' pockets into the seat of Fremantle over the next five weeks. Somehow or other, this Labor government is going to have to make up for what it has done to the people of Fremantle in ignoring them for so long and taking them for granted. </PARA>

It is astounding to me that the media at that stage found it not worth reporting, and yet we had clear evidence of absolutely disgraceful bias in the distribution of these funds. Certainly the amount was a lot less then because the government was not quite as blatant, but can I say this to the media: their failure to report this blatant abuse, this misuse of public money, gave Mrs Kelly a clear feeling she could get away with it. I believe the magnitude and the disgraceful nature of these sports rorts, now revealed by the Auditor-General, are partly the responsibility of an indolent media which decided that this kind of behaviour was totally acceptable and should not be reported. I invite the media to go back and have a look at those Senate estimates hearings and look at the nonsense that was responded to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator Knowles's interjection. For some of them, it typifies either a bias or the fact that so many of them have been terrorised by this government with vulgar threats of non-access to information if they dare run articles attacking, particularly, the Prime Minister. We have seen evidence of the former editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> being told that his employees would not have access to prime ministerial press conferences because of a story they had written which was critical of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have here a situation where, basically, the Auditor-General was alerted to what was happening because of what the Senate estimates committee system revealed. That is why it is absolutely vital that there be no further diminution of the powers of Senate estimates committees, or the capacity of this chamber to debate their reports and recommendations or the matters that come before Senate estimates committees. That was one of the major reservations I had to the changes that have already taken place to limit debate in this chamber on what happens before Senate estimate committees. I think it is a trend in the wrong direction and I am very concerned about it. Maybe the media can take the credit for the fact that, because they helped give Mrs Kelly a false sense of security, she behaved in this incredible way which has now been revealed, in respect of $30 million or something like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind this chamber that, as part of my sports policy when I was shadow minister for sport before the last election, I said that we would cancel this program because it was so crooked. All that happened then was that Mrs Kelly attacked me for proposing to take money away from sports people. It was removing a Labor Party slush fund paid for by the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I want to deal with another matter. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> has issued a front-page story announcing `Piggery partners rate debt'. Basically, it is a strong criticism by the Mayor of Maitland that a company partly owned but run by a Mr Achilles Constantinidis owes three years in back rates to the Maitland City Council. This is not the company that is involved in the piggery venture of which Mr Constantinidis is a half-owner with the Prime Minister. This is another of Mr Constantinidis's companies. But he obviously has a reluctance to meet his bills, whether they are in Mr Keating's jointly owned venture or in his own companies. We all know, for example, that the Keating piggery companies have not paid workers compensation insurance for three years and that writs had to be issued in the Supreme Court of New South Wales before they eventually, on the steps of the court, paid their bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What intrigues me about this matter is that the company in this case which has not paid its rates is called Poyntell Pty Ltd. I have had this paper since last September, although the latest story is only this week. The council papers of last September revealed that Poyntell owed the council $92,533.85 in unpaid rates. But since September, an additional $32,291 for the 12 months to June 30 has been levied against the company and only about $7,000 of that bill has been paid off. There is something like $117,000 still owed to a country council. That is a lot of money, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know from your local government background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the biggest debt owing to the council. That is one thing. Mr Constantinidis is a big man; he is the biggest debtor in unpaid rates to the Maitland council. The Mayor of Maitland, Councillor Bob Gee&mdash;and I do not think anyone can accuse that area of being ultra-conservative; it is in the coalfields of New South Wales&mdash;said that, quite frankly, the council would like the outstanding rates to be paid in full before Mr Constantinidis launched into another investment, like the $80 million piggery joint venture which involves his and Mr Keating's companies somehow magically being able to borrow $30 million against assets which certainly do not appear to be worth anything like that, on any reasonable valuation. In fact, on the basis of existing accounts, there appears to be a clear deficit in real values on assets as against liabilities. So here is Mr Constantinidis, Mr Keating's partner, once again being involved in a debt which this local council is in no position to sustain. The ratepayers of Maitland, quite rightly, should feel as offended as their local mayor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is extraordinary about this&mdash;and this is what I find fascinating because it fits a pattern of behaviour&mdash;is this company, according to the Maitland city records, owes Maitland all this back rate money. I would not call those records into doubt. One would think that if it owes that money that would be a liability in the company's books. Naturally, I have had a look at the latest annual return of Poyntell Pty Ltd at the Securities Commission. The Senate will be astounded&mdash;or maybe the Senate will not be astounded&mdash;to know there is no such debt recorded in its books. There is the annual return for the year to 30 June 1992 signed, of course, by Mr Constantinidis, but signed, I might say, on 31 December 1992&mdash;allegedly signed. It has to be signed by then because they have got to have their annual meeting by then under the law. Curiously, that signed document was not filed with the Securities Commission until 5 July 1993. I wonder why it sat on Mr Constantinidis's desk for so many months before he actually got around to filing it, particularly as there had been no annual accounts for this group filed for six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, Poyntell received a deregistration notice from the Securities Commission for failure to put in annual returns. It is like the Brown and Hatton Group, Mr Keating's half-owned piggery group, revisited. Most of them got notices for failing to put in their annual returns on time. When I first raised this matter, not one of those companies had put in annual returns to the ASC even though they had been registered since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me is: who is right? Is the council right that Poyntell Pty Ltd owes it money, or is the company right in saying, `Oh, no, we don't owe anyone anything on 30 June 1992. We have got current assets of $400 and total assets also of $400 because they are the shareholders' funds contributed by the shareholders. There are four lots of $100 each'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What also intrigues me is that this pattern of failure to meet the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission is not the only significant matter relating to this company because a couple of the other directors of this company are Mr John Scoufis and Mr James Scoufis. They interested me because I can remember looking at the Olympia Refrigeration Group that is part of Mr Keating's half-owned piggery enterprise where there are three Olympia Refrigeration companies. There is another one called Olympia Refrigeration Pty Ltd which is not in the Keating group because it has been delisted, apart from anything else. It was wiped out on a creditor's petition from Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Ltd when it was owned by the Scoufis family. It had failed to pay&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;workers compensation insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether this is all some terrible, quaint, unfortunate coincidence, but it does seem extraordinary to me that Mr Achilles Constantinidis has this close relationship and is on the board of one of his own companies with these people, Mr John Scoufis and Mr James Scoufis, whose company went broke failing to pay workers compensation insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I feel that Mr Keating's partner in his venture clearly has some commercial problems, some financial problems, and they are up to him to resolve. Clearly, he has some difficulty in meeting the requirements of the Corporations Law, which is that you should put in accurate annual returns, and timely annual returns&mdash;in fact, put in annual returns at all. It would seem to me that the person who is in partnership with the Prime Minister should be seen to be behaving in a proper and legal way. It further seems to me that Mr Constantinidis, on the face of it, does not appear to be meeting the sorts of high standards one would expect of a partner of the Prime Minister in a multimillion dollar, multinational joint venture which involves huge indebtedness, which Mr Constantinidis assures us is not to be secured by any kinds of personal guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Mr Keating obviously has great confidence in Mr Constantinidis to allow him to be the person who looks after the financial affairs of all the piggery group companies that Mr Keating has this almost half million dollar investment of his own money in&mdash;at least, we assume it is his own money. Why would Mr Keating put such confidence in a man who, even in the piggery group, has demonstrated that he cannot readily&mdash;until nagged by me, or by the Australian Securities Commission as a result of my pressure&mdash;put in proper returns. They had to be massively corrected and they were massively late&mdash;multimillions of dollars of overstating of profits or understating of losses, and millions of dollars of overstating the real values, the net assets of the group, when five of the seven companies of the group had a deficit of assets against liabilities. I think Mr Constantinidis should smarten up his act, and I am astounded that the Prime Minister should be in partnership with a man who so consistently flouts the requirements of the companies law and the requirements of the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the laughter is not coming from those who ought to be listening more carefully than others to the answer to this question. The question concerns brain shrinkage from alcohol consumption, and I would have thought that would be of interest to all senators. Having looked at some of them over time, I am sure it would be of particular interest to a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that brain shrinkage and impaired brain function are usually associated with heavy drinking and alcoholism, the study by Professor Harper, to which Senator Zakharov referred, does raise questions about what a safe level of alcohol consumption might be. Obviously, when we look at liver disease, strokes and brain damage that are often associated with excessive alcohol consumption, this kind of study is something that we all ought to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alcohol is second only to tobacco as the major cause of drug related mortality in Australia. Approximately 6,600 deaths last year, or more than a quarter of all drug related deaths, were attributed to alcohol.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert is happy with that line. I am glad to hear that. Estimating levels of consumption which are safe for all people, though, is a pretty complex, if not impossible, task. Factors such as gender, age and existing health nutrition as well as the manner, frequency and circumstances in which alcohol is consumed all have health consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC has addressed the question of whether there is a safe level of consumption of alcohol for men and women. It has recommended that education campaigns be continued. It emphasises that, in any given situation, responsibility involves a number of environmental factors, as well as other factors, and the recognition that no absolutely safe level of consumption can be recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NHMRC also recommends that strategies be adopted by governments to encourage a change in community attitudes towards drinking, including the recognition that responsible drinking involves the concept of an acceptable level of risk. It has also recommended that the following guidelines be promoted as being consistent with responsible drinking. For men, consumption should not exceed four units or 40 grams of absolute alcohol a day on a regular basis, or 28 units a week. For women, that consumption should not exceed two units or 20 grams a day, or 14 units a week on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also recommended that binge drinking is potentially hazardous and that people should have at least two alcohol free days a week. I might indicate that I have been managing this of late. The job of Minister for Health is great; it does change one's perceptions!

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Following the suggestion in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday that we might not need a minister for industry, I hasten to assure the minister that, in the view of the Democrats, we do. Not only that, but also we need a Minister for Trade with `high quality new ideas'. I ask the minister: Firstly, does he agree that yesterday's trade deficit of $1.76 billion shows a continuing trend of imports rising faster than exports? Secondly, does he agree that the rising dollar will hit our exports, and that imports are likely to rise even faster as we come out of the recession? Thirdly, does he agree that on the figures for the last six months the much publicised increase in manufactured exports is unlikely to slow down the rising trade deficit? Finally, can he offer any thoughts on how he intends to tackle that imbalance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All that, and in only four minutes, too!  It is the time equivalent of the Prime Minister's `around the world for sixpence', but I will do what I can in the four minutes which I have available to me. I certainly do not accept that the trade deficit figures show a continuing trend of imports rising faster than exports. It depends on the time period, but whichever time period we take, it does not show those results. In the long run, over the last five years, if those are the sorts of trend figures Senator Spindler is looking at, merchandise exports have recorded an average trend growth of about twice that of imports&mdash;7.9 per cent, whereas the figure for growth in imports has been 4.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar picture is evident when we look at trade in services. Exports of services have recorded an average growth rate of 8.7 per cent, which is, as I say, close to double that of services imports. If we look at it over the medium term of five years, the statistics do not bear out Senator Spindler's particular indication. However, if we take a more immediate look at it, for the six months ended December 1993, Australian exports of goods and services grew by about eight per cent while imports grew by a little over 7 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody who has a trade deficit can say that the trend is exactly as he would wish, but my advice is that, with regard to the six months ended December 1993, the current account deficit is slightly down from last year's, in accordance with expectations, and that exports of goods and services grew by about eight per cent and imports by a little over 7 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, firstly, those figures&mdash;either in the medium-term perspective or in the shorter term&mdash;do not bear out those concerns. I do not want to get into anything that could even remotely constitute speculating about the dollar, but there are, of course, trade and other impacts of the rising dollar. It has an impact on the Australian dollar value of our debts, on our payment of those debts, on interest payments and on competitiveness. But if going beyond that would create even a remote possibility of its being interpreted as speculating about the dollar, I will not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator referred to the much publicised increase in manufactured exports. Although it may not have sounded like it, I know that the honourable senator would have welcomed that great increase, as I do&mdash;that continuing and very successful product of the policies of the government, not just in the trade area, led by Senator Cook in the past, but also in the area of industry policy and other economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect the honourable senator is aware&mdash;but perhaps not everyone in the chamber is, and it is very important to know&mdash;that a recent comparison of 32 major trading nations showed that Australia had the fastest trend growth in elaborately transformed manufactured exports of any OECD country since the mid-1980s and the eighth fastest growth overall. This sector is growing quickly and is now becoming, as the honourable senator knows, a very substantial part of our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of the honourable senator's question was: will manufactured exports by themselves close the trade deficit? No, they will not; they are making an important and welcome contribution but they will not by themselves be sufficient. That is why the forecasts coming out of the Outlook conference from the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics have been so encouraging for the future in the whole balance of trade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The ABS publication released at 11.30 a.m. on 2 February&mdash;yesterday&mdash;stated that merchandise exports for the last six months rose at the rate of six per cent, and merchandise imports rose at the rate of 10 per cent. That is the reality that we live with now and that is the reality that the minister has to cope with. In view of the fact that the minister did not seem to contemplate any direct action, I am asking him whether he is willing to institute changes in Australia's anti-dumping laws which are currently skewed against Australia's producers and manufacturers. Secondly, would he favour a more intensive use of the exemption clauses in GATT when that becomes necessary if this trend continues?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that traversing extreme options like that is in any way warranted by the data. Australia's export performance in a range of areas has been very successful. It has been successful, as I said, in relation to the manufactured goods area, it is booming in the services area, and the prospects look encouraging on the commodities front as projected at the recent Outlook conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can get very excited about immediate or monthly figures because of their volatility, or even about very short-term trends. But it seems, on the basis of the last six months, particularly if we take services into account&mdash;which the honourable senator excluded from the figures which he mentioned&mdash;that we are on track to have the sort of trade deficit numbers that the Treasurer alluded to in his most recent forecast, and certainly not worse figures than those which we foresaw in the budget. I think the signs indicate that trade performance can and will continue to succeed. In the more open economy that we have now, there will be a higher proportion of exports and imports in the overall balance of our economy. That is actually a good thing, but it is important that we continue to focus on the export effort. I will not be taking those two steps to which the honourable senator referred in his question, but I will be taking steps to encourage the export efforts of Australians.</PARA>

Its objective is to foster cooperation in combating criminal activities and, in doing so, combat activities which affect the social and economic structure of both our countries. The decision to place an officer in Port Moresby builds on activity already existing within the South Pacific region.

The AFP's commitment is to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies, particularly the regional ones, and to continue to build on our international network. It is worth noting here that this appointment will be an important link in that network. We currently have 15 officers in 13 countries in other parts of the world, though the majority of those officers are in the Asia-Pacific region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only difficulty with the question is that I did not say anything of the sort. Unfortunately, one of the peak bodies that was represented at the conference put out a press statement attributing remarks to me that had been made by one of the questioners at ABARE. At the conference I said that taxation policy is a matter which, at the end of the day, is for the Treasurer and not for me, and it has to be legitimately considered along with all other government policy in terms of its effect on regional Australia. This was in response to a statement made that taxation changes in respect of fuel excise, for example, were `being targeted at rural Australia'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out to the conference, that is a nonsense, because taxation measures, of their very effect, have to be delivered fairly across all of the population. But obviously they have effect in different areas of Australia. The most horrendous problem that could ever be visited on rural Australia would be the introduction of a point of sale tax or consumption tax. That is why I have opposed that particular measure. The farther away we get from the point of supply the worse we are hurt disproportionately. It is an inequitable tax, as we have pointed out again and again. A classic example is my own regional area of the Northern Territory where the residents of the city of Darwin would pay in excess of $100 a year more in federal taxes for using precisely the same amount of electricity as people living in Sydney.</PARA>

But at this stage it is not entirely clear how much work remains to be done on all the various security issues that have been the subject of recent negotiation.

Australia has recognised from the outset that that declaration of principles was only the first step in clearly a long and difficult journey. We see, however, the delay in the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, originally scheduled for 13 December last year, as being disappointing, but as not undermining the accord.</PARA>

The task force recommended that the scheme be legislated and that a review be undertaken.

Contrary to Senator Crane's assertion that ABARE provided gloomy forecasts at the conference, the facts are quite the reverse. As has been noted widely in the rural press and in the industry publications that have been reporting extensively the proceedings of the conference, for the first time for some time, rural Australia does have grounds to be cautiously optimistic about the future.

The situation even with industries such as wool&mdash;an industry with which  Senator Crane and several other active primary producers who are also senators are involved&mdash;is positive. Senator Baume, of course, does not think that Labor members of parliament should have any interests in primary production. Senators would know that the outlook for cattle, for sheep production, for wool, for industries such as the dairy industry and the wine industry&mdash;one of our most rapidly growing value added export primary industries in Australia&mdash;is very positive. The general message being delivered at the ABARE conference is not one of pessimism at all; it is one of cautious optimism.

The benefits that will be received from it will be gradual and will need a great deal of vigilance by the Minister for Trade and all other ministers to ensure that our trading partners fulfil their commitments under the round.

That situation would never have been achieved otherwise. Aboriginal people have seen the benefits that can be brought from mining, whether it is uranium or anything else.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer to a question asked yesterday by Senator Tierney on the issue of a grant to the Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club in Maitland, New South Wales, through the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program in 1992-93. Since 1988-89, when I, as the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, introduced direct funding by this government of community level sport and recreational facilities, over $60 million has been provided for such developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Ros Kelly, offered a grant of $49,000 to the Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club in Maitland for the construction of enclosed turf and practice wickets at Metford oval, Schanck Drive, Metford. The successful application was the first lodged by the club for Commonwealth assistance. It was submitted by the closing date of applications of 3 September 1992. According to departmental files, the club has never applied for funding in any previous round of grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant was one of 188 offered to organisations in New South Wales, the total value of which was over $7 million. Departmental files show that, as a result of discussions between the club and the Maitland City Council, the club has sought and received permission to change the location of the project to Melbourne Street, East Maitland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the change of venue was sought because the Metford site, although partially developed as a recreation area, is now being used by Landcom as a building dump site. Landcom had given an undertaking to the Maitland City Council in 1988 that it would develop this site as a sporting oval. As I said, this had not happened, so the council and the club decided to seek a change of venue for these much needed facilities. Maitland City Council identified Melbourne Street as the site for a new sporting complex and, together with the cricket club, agreed to develop the cricket facilities there rather than at Metford for the reason I have just stated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the new location is an old gasworks site. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority has indicated that possible contamination may also exist at that site. The Maitland City Council currently has a proposal with the EPA&mdash;awaiting approval&mdash;for testing on the site. Subject to this approval, the council has a development application pending. So Senator Tierney was wrong about the council, as usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly has indicated to me that, should any difficulties be encountered with the proposed site, she is willing to consider an alternative site. The minister's main concern is that the residents of the region have access to the proposed facilities. Similarly, officers of the Maitland City Council have shown a strong commitment to the project, indicating that, in the event of insurmountable problems being detected on the current site, an alternative location will be found by the council. There is no question of the grant being lost to the people of the Maitland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Senator Tierney's accusation of political bias in the awarding of this grant, this is pure fantasy on his part. Mr Peter Blackmore, the Liberal member for the state seat of Maitland, debunked this myth after the issue was first raised by Mr Ronaldson in the House of Representatives. In an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> on 27 November 1993, Mr Blackmore said that he did not think that Mr Tony Keating&mdash;who was, in fact, his ALP opponent&mdash;`had done anything wrong'. The area represented by the East Maitland Cricket Club is one of relatively high growth and with a lack of adequate sporting facilities and obviously one deserving of this grant. As I said yesterday, Senator Tierney should stop picking on the people of Maitland.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ferguson this day, relating to taxation of primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this week when I read what Senator Collins was reported to have said at the ABARE conference I took some heart from the fact that I had read that Senator Collins had indicated that there was a need for taxation reform to assist exporters, and I think particularly of those exporters who are involved in primary production. One of the main elements of the coalition's policy prior to the last election was to ensure that people involved in exporting, particularly those in the primary production area, would have some relief from the current high taxation, particularly indirect taxation, that is levied by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disturbed to hear Senator Collins say in his answer that taxation policy is a matter for the Treasurer and not for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I would say that that is not a particularly encouraging start for our primary industries minister if this means that he will not be examining the effect of taxation on our export industries, particularly primary producing industries which would be a lot more competitive on the world stage if it were not for the high indirect taxation that they are currently forced to pay. He said later on that it was a nonsense to suggest that increases in fuel excise were targeted at rural Australians; that they applied to the whole of Australia. They might apply to the whole of Australia but it is an undeniable fact that people in rural Australia and those involved in rural industries spend a far greater proportion of their time driving&mdash;and included in this is the cost of transport&mdash;than their city counterparts because they have to cover such long distances. Therefore they are disproportionately affected by hidden indirect taxes such as fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins tried to avoid the question by talking about a consumption tax. He said that the Nationals should hang their heads in shame. None of us on the coalition side are hanging our heads in shame because we are sticking up for our rural constituents, who really have had a gutful of indirect taxes like sales tax and fuel excise. It is a pity that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will not take this into account when formulating what needs to be done. I asked the minister whether he was saying that there was not a need for any taxation reform to help Australian exporters and he replied that taxation policy is as legitimate an area to consider as any other government policy in respect of its effect on rural Australia. Really, if the minister tackles nothing else while he is primary industries minister, he will serve rural Australia well if he tackles the issue of taxation, and particularly indirect taxation, on our primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat disturbed to hear the minister later talk about a revision of the number of bodies involved in the primary industry department. A lot of the people affected by this indirect taxation are also affected by other things over which they have no control, such as the mouse plague that was mentioned by my colleague Senator Chapman. One of the recommendations brought forward was the establishment of a mouse commission similar to the locust commission. I sincerely hope, when the minister is looking at reducing the number of bodies, that the locust commission is not on his list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the effectiveness of the locust commission, it was decided after a lot of consideration that something similar should be done to try to avoid mouse plagues that we have experienced in the past. I notice that a lot of those opposite thought it was very humorous when my colleague Senator Chapman asked a question about the mouse plague, but there is nothing funny about living through one. Having lived through a plague in the middle and at the end of last year, I can say that it is one of the most terrible things anyone in rural Australia or elsewhere could live though. It is not a laughing matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the minister that people living in areas affected by mice plagues would not be heartened by his answer to Senator Chapman's requests. The things that afflict rural communities in varying degrees over a period of time have serious effects, as they did in South Australia and other parts of Australia last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond briefly to the concerns that have just been raised. The question of taxation is a vitally important issue not only to primary industry or rural Australia but to every Australian. It is essential that people in public life constantly look for ways in which taxation measures can assist industry. I simply reiterate that at the end of the day the person who is responsible for determining government policy on taxation is the Treasurer, and correctly so. I reiterate&mdash;because I hope that the lesson has been learned by those opposite&mdash;that the worst forms of taxation for people in the bush are point of sale taxes. We have had some experience of that. For years in the Northern Territory we have paid sales tax on the freight component of goods. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar or have an economics degree to work out that if one imposes a point of sale tax on a certain commodity, the further away from the point of supply people get, and the higher the price of the goods when they are purchased in a normal retail fashion, the more disproportionately higher is the level of taxation. I have been living with that situation now for nearly 30 years; it is one that I am very familiar with. I condemned the National Party vociferously at the time&mdash;the record shows it, so I am not being wise after the event&mdash;for the mouse-like support that it gave to that outrageous proposal to impose a consumption tax on rural Australia&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins does not seem to understand that if one lives in Katherine, Kununurra or Hughenden and wants to see a specialist, one does not just get in the car and drive a couple of blocks, as in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne; one has to drive 500, 600, 700 and 800 kilometres. The effect is that every litre of fuel used generates a tax to the general revenue in the order of 25c a litre. That tax does not go to roads; it is not going to what one uses. That tax goes to the general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Katherine, the people of Broome and the people of Hughenden pay their income tax, the same as every other Australian. They put their money in to pay for the services that we all have to pay for. But those people in remote areas have to pay more to the general coffers simply because they happen to be disadvantaged enough to live in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election the coalition recognised that. We proposed to completely abolish fuel tax&mdash;a saving of 33c a litre on what one pays now for fuel. Not only did the Labor Party reject our proposal to abolish the fuel tax, but also, subsequent to the election, it has increased it again. This simply means that people in the country have to pay more in general tax for the privilege of living in country areas. The fuel tax is the worst possible thing that could happen to primary producers and those living in remote and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Collins wants to in any way try to redeem himself and stop that run of failures he has had throughout his life, then he could do something about that fuel tax for country people and primary producers. If he could get rid of that fuel tax, as we proposed at the last election, he would go down in history as someone who has genuinely done something for rural and regional Australia. But I fear that Senator Collins will wimp that challenge and will not be interested in it or the people who have to live in rural and remote Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the extent that this debate has drifted into Senator Collins's answer to my question on mice, I simply reinforce the need for the institution of a national mouse plague commission. The minister in his answer to me said that if he thought such a body would lead to the death of just one mouse, then he would be in favour of its establishment. Let me assure him that it will. It is not just another body to be established along with the myriad of bodies which he referred to as being part of his department, and the existence of which he wants to review; it will have a very positive role in the future in dealing with the problem of mice in rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two main areas of concern with mice plagues. The minister alluded to these in his response to Senator Ferguson. The first is the capacity to predict the likelihood of a plague. The second is the need for an effective rodenticide to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the first matter, the capacity to predict the likelihood of a plague, there is a much greater need for national coordination of the monitoring of the build-up of mouse numbers. This is done in isolated areas and in an isolated way at the moment. It is not done on a national basis or with adequate national coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experts to whom Senator Collins referred, both in his answer and his further response in this debate, are clearly of the opinion&mdash;and this is evident if we consult the report of the national rodent workshop that was sponsored by the Grains Research and Development Corporation&mdash;that an effective monitoring program will make it possible to develop a highly sophisticated predictive capacity which will allow us to predict when a mouse plague is imminent. Early preventative action can then be taken to prevent the numbers of mice increasing to plague proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one very strong argument for the establishment of a national mouse plague commission. The second is the need for better coordination of research into effective preventative methods, particularly the development of an effective rodenticide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister referred to the use of strychnine as a rodenticide. He questioned its effectiveness. It is certainly the only effective counter measure against mice that is available and proves effective, but it is obviously not an ideal counter measure. Indeed, it is passing strange that after more than a century of mouse plagues in this country, with all the scientific advances that we have had here and internationally over that period, we are still relying on a rodenticide, in the form of strychnine, that is more than a century old. With all the developments in science and technology we have not developed a more effective poison or alternative method of killing these rodents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research is being conducted in various quarters but there is a need for that research to be coordinated and focused so that an effective rodenticide that can be brought into use in the very near future is developed. There is an important role for the commission in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter certainly needs to be effectively managed. As Senator Macdonald mentioned a few moments ago, considering the history of this minister one doubts whether he has the capacity to manage anything within his department effectively. This commission, if structured and managed properly, need not be the traditional, ineffective bloated bureaucracy. It can operate on a very lean and mean basis and bring in the expertise needed from time to time. My proposal is that the actual monitoring process be undertaken by farmers themselves because they are the best people equipped to monitor the development of mouse plagues&mdash;the growth in mouse numbers&mdash;and to report back on the development of that situation so that effective preventative action can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need for this commission to be established because mouse numbers are again building up in Victoria and South Australia. The potential for a plague exists and we need an effective coordinating body to be put in place to take over the monitoring role and the development of effective counter measures urgently so that another plague does not develop, which would be to the detriment of not only rural producers but all Australians who benefit from what is produced by our rural producers. The mouse plague cost in the order of $175 million last year. We do not want that to occur again to the detriment of rural producers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney on 2 February 1993, relating to the allocation of sports funding.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson yesterday came up with an almost laughable answer to the questions raised by me about the sports rorts in Maitland. He got his facts totally wrong, and said that I should be happy with the facility being developed in the city. He was missing the entire point, of course, which was that East Maitland was about to lose the grant totally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously Senator Richardson's department or Mrs Kelly's department pointed that out to him and he had another try today. I am amazed at the answer provided by him today. I wonder where he has got his information from, because there were supposed to be no records of these grants. Yet he spelled out chapter and verse the history of this particular grant. He spelled out what happened when the club moved from one field to the other, and he had dates and all sorts of things for this application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must have been the enormous brain power of the minister that provided him with this information. She claims that she can keep 2,800 different applications in her mind&mdash;all the particular cases, including all the circumstances and the histories. She did not need any paper work. Yet today all this information was displayed. One wonders where it came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders also about why Senator Richardson, a former minister for the environment, played down the real problem with the site that has been chosen for this sports facility. The real problem is that it is being developed on a former gasworks site. Senator Richardson told us that there might be a few environmental problems with this site. There are absolutely massive environmental problems with this site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Huge deposits of toxic tar were discovered recently on another site in Maitland, which was also a former gasworks site. There is so much concern about the East Maitland cricket club site that a fence has been built around it to keep people out. The council is trying to get expenses from the former owner, the Australian Gas Light Co., to cover the expenses of removing the tar. The upshot is that it will take time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the other point that the minister failed to answer&mdash;that is, what is actually happening to the grant? In his response this afternoon he smoothed over that. He tried to give the impression that East Maitland was still going to receive the grant, but it is very obvious that time will run out because of all these difficulties and East Maitland will lose this facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could ask why the grant was given in the first place. East Maitland was totally unprepared for the grant. It did not have a DA or a BA and there were environmental concerns, yet the money was rushed to it. Why? One would think that one of the major players in the East Maitland cricket club, Tony Keating, the chief staffer of Mr Horne, the local member, and a candidate for the state seat of Maitland, obviously had something to do with this group getting the money in an inappropriate way. There is a real question to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a perfect case study of allocating money to sports facilities not so much with the community benefit in mind but with political benefit in mind. This occurred in all the marginal seats on the north coast of New South Wales. While the three poorest seats of Richmond, Page and Cowper in the far north did receive grants, the marginal seats received twice as much as the safe National Party seat. It was obviously a rort. It is something that the minister has to answer. Today Senator Richardson gave yet another inappropriate answer. We will see whether he can do a little better on Monday.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of issues that I would like to raise with regard to the question I put today. The question was in three parts: first, what value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar was used by ABARE to arrive at commodity prices, particularly for agricultural export markets; second, what steps will be taken to address the inadequacies as identified by Dr Fisher, the executive director of ABARE, with regard to the rural adjustment scheme; and, third, has ABARE shifted emphasis with the rural adjustment scheme away from debt reconstruction towards phasing farmers out of the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last part of my question&mdash;in some respects, the most important part&mdash;was totally ignored by the minister. An adjustment process has occurred in agriculture over the last 20 years, with increased pressure over the last few years&mdash;particularly since the engineered recession of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, while he was Treasurer. I find it alarming and disappointing that we are now seeing that emphasis coming through. It is highlighted by what Dr Fisher had to say to the ABARE conference. Dr Fisher said that the magnitude of the required adjustment was beyond the scope of the federal government's existing rural adjustment scheme, reflecting a view held by ABARE that the scheme's emphasis should move from keeping farmers on the land to providing more aid for them to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make about this change of emphasis is that we will again see farmers, through no fault of their own, on the merry-go-round of falling into hard times and getting into difficult financial circumstances. Through a build-up process, one property debt will be transferred to another. We only have to wait another four or five years and the cycle will repeat itself. We have seen that happen regularly, particularly since the late 1960s and early 1970s. That is a matter of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the rural adjustment scheme has failed to address the pressures on agriculture that exist at the present time. Those pressures result from the high costs being faced by the industry. That was highlighted today by Senator Ferguson's question on the matter. The minister has failed to address that issue. He talked about the amount of money that the federal government has put into the rural adjustment scheme since it has been in power. I do not deny that, but it has been misplaced and misdirected money. It was only needed because of the failed economic policy of those who sit on the other side of this chamber and on the government benches in the House of Representatives. It would not have been needed if we had had proper policy and if the government had addressed some of the structural problems we have in this country, including taxation, transport and the work practices in place on our wharves and in other areas. That is where the real adjustment has to be made. Those are the areas that need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another point in terms of these figures. The minister was quite wrong when he said that there was an improved outlook for agricultural products. It is borne out by the figures. We do not have to look very far. We just have to look at the wool industry, for example. Its forecast for 1993-94 was 475c. The figure for 1992-93 was 488c. If that figure is not going down, I do not know what is going down. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that wool looks sweeter than sugar, and wool is falling. One can only assume from that that sugar will be worse. As we work through the figures, we find that is a consistent approach. That is done&mdash;might I add, because the minister did not know the answer to this question&mdash;at an averaging of the dollar of 67c. The dollar has been sitting at 70c or a little higher for some time. I know that is a fluctuating thing. The problems were borne out by the announcement yesterday of a blow-out in our current account to $1.7 billion. One acknowledges that that is a one month figure, but it is a symptom of the lack of policy direction of this government. The government addresses one thing and it blows out somewhere else because the government's focus is so narrow. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TABLING OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3 FEBRUARY 1994, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) is one of the Australian aid program's "quiet achievers". The Centre commissions and promotes research aimed at improving sustainable agricultural production in developing countries&mdash;principally in the Asia-Pacific region. By doing so it contributes to their well being&mdash;particularly benefiting rural areas where most people in developing countries live. By increasing general economic growth amongst many of our neighbours, the Centre's research in turn assists Australia's economic growth and its security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR was set up as a statutory authority in 1982. Its mandate was broadened in 1992, following a highly favourable review of its operations by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Some of the many complimentary remarks made about the Centre following the tabling of the report included that of Committee Chairman Senator Chris Schacht, who said, `In my view ACIAR is one of those good news stories that does not get the coverage in the Australian media that organisations like it should get'. Australia's Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, described it as a `lean, professional organisation with an excellent approach to its task'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR's new mandate is to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">commission research into improving agricultural production in developing countries</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">fund some project-related training (both informal and postgraduate)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">commission some development of results from its research programs</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">administer the Australian Government's funding contribution to the International Agricultural Research Centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Promoting bilateral research collaboration between Australia and developing countries remains ACIAR's primary aim. It mobilises Australian agricultural research expertise to help developing countries help themselves. It achieves this by commissioning research groups in Australian universities, the CSIRO and the state agriculture departments to carry out joint research projects in partnership with their counterparts in developing countries. The commissioned research focuses on high-priority problems in developing countries in fields in which Australia has particular scientific and technical competence&mdash;and there are many. Research takes place both in Australia and in the partner countries, and it is a feature of ACIAR projects that they are specifically chosen to maximise the benefits to both our developing-country partners and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sometimes argued that international agricultural assistance simply helps our competitors and reduces markets for Australian agricultural products. In reality the reverse is true. By increasing incomes, it enables people to purchase more, and experience demonstrates that one of the first things they buy more of is food. In Indonesia, for example, as agricultural production increased during the 1980s Australian wheat exports to Indonesia increased by over 200,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR research helps Australian farmers directly as well as indirectly. It is conservatively estimated, for example, that the international agricultural research to which Australia contributes through ACIAR has increased the earnings of Australian farmers by more than $2 billion over the last two decades, principally through the use of high yielding varieties of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is rare among aid donor countries in that it shares with most developing countries a similar location in tropical, subtropical or `mediterranean' latitudes. As a result, Australia's agricultural scientists find themselves working within an extensive and very successful network of agricultural research establishments, dealing more often than not with agricultural problems similar to those of much of the developing world. It is ACIAR's contribution to have given Australia a more effective focus for its research collaboration with developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 11 years of operations ACIAR has commissioned around 240 projects, usually over 3-year periods, 170 of which have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has tackled the critical problem of agricultural land degradation and the associated spoilage of natural resources. The Rio Earth Summit's Agenda 21 calls for action to safeguard agricultural production by protecting natural resources and minimising environmental pollution. ACIAR has responded in a number of ways, including mounting a coordinated effort to alleviate the physical problems arising from poor farming practices on hilly lands in the Southeast Asian region. The research complements studies to determine how best to introduce suitable technologies to smallholder farmers with little understanding of the need for change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has discovered new varieties of Australian trees and shrubs that will help meet the fuel wood, agroforestry and industrial needs of developing countries. Seven years' research to find better adapted trees for China has led to the planting of 17 000 hectares of high-performing acacia and eucalypt species and the provision for further plantings of acacias in China's 5-year plan. In Indonesia  propagation techniques for acacias are now being applied to large-scale forestry. In addition, Pakistan, Thailand and Australia, together with many other countries with salt-affected agricultural lands, stand to benefit from the identification of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that can restore some productivity to otherwise useless land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has developed environmentally safe, appropriate technologies that have improved the health and productivity of animals owned by smallholder farming communities. In India, farmers have had milk production increases of over 10 per cent in dairy cattle and buffalo, as a result of the combined effect on their nutrition of giving them nutrient blocks with medication added to control internal parasites. In the Pacific Islands scientists have found that goats need almost no medication for internal parasites if they are moved through a rotational grazing system that prevents infection from pastures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the traditional crops of Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific, such as coconut, banana, sweet potato and cassava, suffer from viral, bacterial and fungal diseases. ACIAR research has developed more productive, disease-free lines of some of these crops.  For example, banana varieties with resistance to black sigatoka disease have been identified. This disease is a potential scourge of banana crops world-wide, including Australia, and was recently isolated and contained in north Queensland as a direct result of this project. The possession of resistant varieties is a good insurance policy to protect our multi-million dollar banana industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Biological control and integrated pest management have been encouraged and progressed through ACIAR's crop protection program. Last year two ACIAR publications on biological control containing some outstanding examples of successful programs to control pests and weeds in Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. In addition, researchers have compiled a large body of data on fruit flies in Malaysia, Thailand and four Pacific countries that will lead to better control of fruit flies and improved quarantine protection. Associated with this is the development of bait spraying for preharvest control of fruit flies in orchards and field crops. When cover sprays are used for control they often kill pollinating bees and other beneficial insects, but bait spraying uses a tiny quantity of insecticide mixed with a substance such as hydrolysed yeast that attracts only fruit flies. The method is not only safer but cheaper in materials and labour. The investment of $800,000 in this project is projected to yield an overall benefit to Australia of $176 million through local application&mdash;a staggering 220:1 return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR has become a major player in the arena of safe postharvest handling, processing, storage, transport and marketing of both durable and perishable foods in the humid tropics. Much of the increase in food production in Asia over recent decades can be attributed to early maturing varieties which enable two crops per year to be harvested instead of one. This has presented producers with the challenge of storing grains during the wet season with high humidity and heightened pest activity. The Postharvest Program works closely with national, regional and international agencies concerned with food handling. Smaller-scale operators and farmer cooperatives are specifically targeted in the program's current work on outdoor storage and grain drying, with high potential to deliver the benefits of new technology to the poorer sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern world-wide about dwindling fisheries resources is mirrored in the ACIAR Fisheries program. Ongoing studies in countries of the Indo-Pacific have given a clearer understanding of the effects of commercial baitfishing on traditional fishing grounds and provided a better basis for effective co-management arrangements between traditional owners and industry. A current study of the seasonal abundance and distribution of billfish, such as marlin and sailfish, will assist Pacific countries to preserve the habitats and regulate the catch of these fish, which are of particular interest to game fishermen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In association with its applied research, ACIAR funds economic studies to ensure that new technologies are implemented and that national agricultural policies are appropriate for the promotion of economic development. One research project devised a computer model of the Philippines economy that focuses on interactions between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy. Application of the model revealed that one third of economic growth in the Philippines over recent decades resulted from technological advances in agriculture, and that the economic gains primarily benefited lower-income groups. This study is the most comprehensive of its kind to date, and is likely to have international influence in promoting agricultural research as a means of achieving both economic growth and poverty alleviation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of ACIAR's mission is to enhance the research capacity of institutions in developing countries. This is achieved by visits from Australian scientists who spend time with their colleagues in their home-country institutions, by the conduct of project-related training courses both overseas and in Australia, and by the awarding of ACIAR Fellowships for project-related postgraduate training in Australia. The effects of these activities are becoming evident as ACIAR's programs mature and diversify in its 25 or so partner countries. There is a true sense of international partnership, and evidence of the increasing confidence of partner country scientists is reflected in the increasing number of authors from Southeast Asia in the published scientific literature. Furthermore, countries that once looked to Australia for expertise are now sources of information to assist their neighbours. For instance a recent forestry research initiative in Laos went ahead because the Thai partners bridged the cultural and language gap and conducted training in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR, with funding assistance from the Crawford Fund for International Agricultural Research, has staged a number of master classes associated with specific projects to give advanced training to developing-country scientists. One on molecular genetics held at Monash University involved 14 senior researchers from seven countries; another on plant virology held in Thailand attracted 20 scientists from nine countries. Response from the participants has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International standing</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1992 ACIAR took over responsibility for administering Australia's contribution to the International Agricultural Research Centres, previously undertaken by AIDAB. ACIAR has reinstated the Special Purpose Grants program which is designed to aid research collaboration of the international centres with Australian and developing-country institutions. ACIAR's familiarity with the operations of the international centres make it well placed to administer Australia's commitment to them, both in terms of development assistance and enlightened self interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACIAR is now held in high regard internationally and frequently cited as an model of excellence for others to follow in institutional planning. Recently the Centre acted as implementing agency for the establishment of the new Centre for International Forestry Research, which is now up and running in Bogor, Indonesia. ACIAR research coordinators regularly undertake short-term advisory consultancies for other international bodies such as FAO and the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling the 1992-93 Annual Report of the Centre, I hope I have demonstrated to honourable members that ACIAR continues to be a "quiet achiever" among Australia's successful international initiatives. Like AIDAB, the other aid agency within the Development Cooperation portfolio, it is staffed by dedicated men and women who have a commitment to excellence which ought to be a matter of pride to all Australians, as it is to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude with an observation from one of the Centre's overseas partners, the Agricultural University of Malaysia. When ACIAR was reviewed in 1991 Professor Syed, a Deputy Vice Chancellor of that university, made a submission to the review committee. He praised ACIAR for helping to advance agriculture in the tropical and developing nations, and pointed to manifold benefits arising from joint research. But while Malaysia appreciated the solutions arising from the research, Professor Syed said that the enhancement of expertise amongst project scientists was of equal significance. He believed involvement in ACIAR projects was one of the few means by which local scientists could gain access to foreign expertise and participate in technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is, in the end, what ACIAR exists for&mdash;to help other countries help themselves. I believe that it does so out of all proportion to its cost. I commend the Report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>The report is in respect of the year 1992-93. I remind the Senate that this year was the first full year in which the PPS fund was managed separately from the original fund. The investments have grown quite remarkably&mdash;from $926 million to $1,291 million, a 36 per cent increase. Interestingly enough, the best performing sectors were those of overseas shares and overseas fixed interest. The fund performance&mdash;9.25 per cent after tax and fees&mdash;exceeded that of the target portfolio. All of this is refreshing news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fund is of significant size. It has 98,710 members, an increase of 9.4 per cent over that of the previous year. My colleague Senator Newman will be interested to hear that women comprise 56 per cent of its membership, so they are significant members. This raises the question about the need for women who have significant part-time employment to be able to top up contributions. For example, under a lot of the arrangements it is difficult for them to get, say, 40 years continuous services, which is a bit of a yardstick for determining what will be a satisfactory level of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that 16 per cent of members contribute below five per cent of salary, it means then that 74.9 per cent of members pay five per cent of their salaries into the fund. The new arrangements through additional death and invalidity policy with National Mutual came into effect on 1 July 1993. As of June 1993, only 194 members were paying premiums for additional cover on death and disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to use this opportunity to raise an issue of some concern&mdash;the tax on superannuation of medically retired public servants. The tax treatment of lump sum superannuation payments was raised in the press as a matter of some concern. The problem arose from a clash between the New South Wales legislation on how the scheme was to be administered and the Commonwealth legislation on how benefits would be controlled. Specifically, the problem relates to how invalidity benefits are measured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might remind the Senate that invalid benefits are taxed at a more generous rate than other retirement benefits. In order to receive the more generous tax rate certain criteria must be met. The state scheme seems to provide for a benefit that unfortunately at the time did not meet those criteria. I have been advised that an interim solution has been found by way of using the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner's discretionary powers to have the benefit treated as though it were an invalid pension even though it does not meet the Commonwealth criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not aware of any long-term solutions in terms of the new reasonable benefit rules to be administered by the tax office. I thought it significant enough to use this opportunity to raise this question of invalidity and to clarify the position in respect of a number of public servants who I know are aware of it. I am pleased that an interim arrangement has been established to overcome the problems they were faced with. </PARA>

This document is a consolidation of welfare related data that is collected both nationally and on a state-territory level.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of my portfolio, I was interested to look at the aged care sector. I read about CAM and SAM funding. For those of my colleagues who think they are the names of two residents living in a nursing home, I advise that they are in fact two types of funding. The document is very factual; in fact a residents' rights agreement is talked about as well as the fact that the government brought in legislation relating to residents' rights in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document does not discuss how many nursing homes or how many residents have actually signed residents' rights agreements so one will only get factual information about the policy and the implementation of that policy to a point, but there is no information on other points which ought to be addressed&mdash;though not necessarily in this sort of document. I would sound a note of caution in the sense that the document really provides factual information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other things need to be addressed apart from the factual information. Nursing homes and hostels should be asked about the details of the programs outlined in this document. One will then actually see a somewhat different story. That is my only note of caution. It gives good factual information, but should honourable senators really want to know what is actually going on they need to talk with service providers to find out how it is being implemented. </PARA>

<PARA>I note first of all that the document was signed by my distinguished cousin Professor Peter Baume on 1 November 1993; the financial accounts were signed on 26 November 1993; the Senate business sheet tells us that it was received by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on 16 December but for some curious reason it did not come to the Senate by the time it rose, 22 December. We eventually get this annual report in February. The amount of time taken is disappointing, but at least it gives me the opportunity to deal with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for that interjection. I think the Sports Drug Agency is a very worthwhile and well-run operation. But I am concerned about the fall off that the annual report reveals in the level of user-pay tests that has taken place. In 1991-92, for example, there were 817 user-pays tests; in 1992-93 there were 743. That is a fall of 74, almost 10 per cent. I do not know the reason for it. As my quick flip through the annual report does not indicate the reason to me, I may be doing an injustice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would know, Mr Deputy President, the proposition that you and I have been putting in this place for many years has been that ASDA should seek to maximise the user-pay tests so that the burden does not fall entirely on the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is disappointing to see this fall off, particularly as the five-year target for the user-pays drug testing service has been one of continual increase. In fact, by 1995-96 there is an expectation, or a hope, that there will be 1,300 user-pay tests at ASDA. That compared with, say, 2,500 government user-paid tests makes it a pretty healthy proportion. At the moment it involves an increase in the user-pay target of something like a quite substantial 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key is that unless ASDA has users paying more for the services of ASDA, this requirement to test people for drugs will fall more and more heavily on all Australians rather than just sporting Australians. It seems an unfair burden. I might say that this general question of revenues does not look terribly good. We have seen a fall in operating revenues from independent sources compared with the total revenues, including governmental revenue, from 10 per cent in 1991-92 to about only 7.6 per cent in 1992-93. I notice the forecast for 1993-94 is back up to 10 per cent, and I hope that that percentage will increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to note&mdash;I am certain many people will be keen to see this&mdash;that the table on drug testing statistics shows which sports are in fact being heavily examined. I commend the rugby league, for example, for the fact that it is, on a paying basis, getting many drug tests done. I think this has been to the benefit of the Australian rugby league, as is clear from the fact that penalties have been imposed. I hope that this will discourage young Australians from being foolish enough to undertake excessive drug consumption.</PARA>

<PARA>I commend the Australian Sports Drug Agency for this document. It notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sport is about participation, performance, competition and achievement. Above all, it is about building character and improving the health and well-being of the nation. Drugs to enhance physical performance undermine the essential values of all that sport is about. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is committed to reducing the harm associated with drug use in sport in order to enhance the well being of individuals and the value of sport to society.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that statement. That is why I was very disappointed to see an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in which Mr Neil King from Athletics Australia was very critical of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The article quotes Mr King as saying that athletes who were caught using drugs would escape punishment on technicalities unless changes were made to the Australian Sports Drug Agency's practices and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I hope Mr King has been misquoted. Having read that article, it appears to me that Mr King has some major misunderstandings about what sports drug testing is all about in terms of the people being tested. The requirement under the Privacy Act is that the first thing to be done if someone rejects a test is advise that person&mdash;I think that person has three weeks or so; I assume that is right because that is the situation if there is a positive test&mdash;of the consequences before anyone else is advised. That is only right and proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Athletics Australia is saying that its policy in the last few months has been that, if ASDA does not advise Athletics Australia immediately of a refusal to accept a drug test&mdash;in other words, does not give the benefit of the Privacy Act to athletes&mdash;Athletics Australia will not follow through with penalties against athletes. That is a disgrace, and I hope Mr King withdraws that comment. The point is that we are obliged, under the law, to give athletes that level of privacy. I think they have three weeks to respond before anyone else is told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Athletics Australia is serious, all it has to do is require its own athletes to sign a membership form which acknowledges that Athletics Australia has to be advised in the event of their having got a refusal or any communication from the Australian Sports Drug Agency. It is up to Athletics Australia to do that. But I am darned if this parliament, which passed this law, should be dictated to by Athletics Australia about how our drug policy should be implemented and what sorts of privacy standards should exist with athletes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr King should go away, scratch his head and decide the best way to fix this problem. For him to say that because the organisation has changed its policy and will not penalise athletes by banning them&mdash;by the way, they normally get rubbed out for four years for refusing to take a test&mdash;and that, therefore, it is the Sports Drug Agency's fault, is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the fact that Athletics Australia has had some problems in its relationship with the Australian Sports Drug Agency, or it may be the other way round, but, on my understanding of these matters it has largely emerged from the fact that some senior officials in Athletics Australia&mdash;you, Mr Deputy President, would be aware of them&mdash;had in fact connived with some athletes to alter samples. I do not want to become involved in any kind of slanging match with people but this is a major issue. It is vital that Athletics Australia cooperate properly with the Australian Sports Drug Agency. It is simply wrong for Athletics Australia to say that ASDA had refused Athletics Australia's request to test specific athletes. I have checked that with ASDA. It is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Athletics Australia has to get down to cooperating properly with what I believe is a well-run organisation&mdash;and I do not say that simply because my cousin is the chairman of it. This organisation has a good set of objectives and is playing a major role in clearing Australian sport of the horrific consequences of drugs. Athletes are dying as a result of drug taking. This kind of sniping in today's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is not in the best interests of athletics and it is not in the best interests of the campaign against drug taking. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Baume has just referred to a report dated last December. This report was dated 10 December 1993, and it is now being tabled in the chamber. Had it been tabled at the end of last year when it was ready, it may have been received by the same minister to whom it was addressed&mdash;Senator Bob McMullan, as the then Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. Now that the report has been tabled in February, it is not the responsibility of the same minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read this report with amusement. So much for the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the priority of the arts&mdash;a priority which seems to have escaped his attention in the recent cabinet reshuffle. I thought that the ALP was keen to maintain the myth that it had this solid contact with the arts community. I suppose some of the arts community would be pretty furious that they have established this relationship with Senator McMullan and spent hours briefing and talking to him, only to find that suddenly, because he has done what may appear to some people to be a reasonable job&mdash;yet we have got some doubts about that&mdash;in the administrative services portfolio, he dumps the arts portfolio, and Mr Lee has been given the arts portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, I want to speak about the report. I also mention that Film Australia has made some quite significant changes over the past 12 months in terms of its staffing. It has acknowledged that that has not been easy and has actually impacted on some individuals who have served the organisation for some time. Obviously, it felt that was necessary because of the financial situation. The use of space was also rationalised within the Lindfield premises and it sought successfully to lease large portions of the excess. It should be commended on seeing that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested also as to the way in which it is marketing and distributing Australian films. By commenting on one film one may omit others and I do not wish to do that, but the report mentions <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kangaroos: Faces in the Mob</EMPHASIS>. On page 24 one can see the long list of awards that documentary has received already. If any of my colleagues in this chamber have not seen that film, I commend it to them. In order to market it, Film Australia has located this film in ABC shops, zoos, national parks, wildlife kiosks, Australiana shops, airport outlets, and a number of other areas. It is looking to try to sell it through Readers Digest, Avon, Amway, Doubleday Book Club, SBS catalogues, et cetera. It is using innovative and creative techniques to market this wonderful film&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kangaroos: Faces in the Mob</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at this report, one's attention is drawn also to the fostering of trade relations with Asia which Film Australia is engaging in. This is demonstrated by, firstly, its partnership with a Japanese company, NHK Japan, on the children's project <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Escape from Jupiter</EMPHASIS>; and, secondly, the marketing and distribution contract with a group in Japan for the television, video, merchandising and publishing rights to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Johnson and Friends</EMPHASIS>. These are two examples of a movement into the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another innovation which needs to be brought to the Senate's attention occurs on page 15 and relates to special projects. We see that Film Australia is involving itself in a  relationship with the National Museum of Australia to look at ways in which innovative means can be used to transfer the experience of collections across time and space in order to enable access to films by people in remote areas. The aim is to create the opportunity for all Australians to participate in the nation's cultural heritage. One has only to look at the changes in technology that are about to occur to realise how organisations such as Film Australia need to be almost ahead of the game in order to benefit from those changes. It is heartening to see that it is projecting itself forward and looking towards changes in technology to facilitate the promotion of Australian films. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

The children for whom they care come largely from the most disadvantaged groups in society. They have expressed serious concerns about the accreditation guidelines. I was referring to a statement put out by the society last Monday. I quote from it:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>that is the privacy one&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which, if found to be correct, demonstrates a lack of compassion for families in the International Year of the Family. The Society is most concerned because it has begun work to ensure that rapid implementation of accreditation. If our clients and families in general are going to be faced with cost increases which they can't afford, then nobody benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>I am informed that the society has now had to employ two part-time employees to start implementing the accreditation guidelines for the society. It has found that the government's handbook is very vague and difficult to use for implementing the accreditation process and it is still waiting for the work book to come from the authorities. In addition, the Sydney Rescue Work Society has today issued a media release which  may do more to convince the Democrats and the Greens than did the material provided earlier by other people who had been looking at the cost of implementation. This media release,  dated today and signed by Mr J.B. Robinson, the chief executive officer, says:</PARA>

I was not aware at this stage that the Council was an incorporated body.</PARA>

<PARA>Once again, here is confirmation that the opposition's concerns on both cost and privacy are serious matters not satisfactorily addressed to date by the government, and a delay will do nothing but give these serious matters time to be more carefully addressed. What is the government saying to Australia's families? It is saying, `We don't care if you face higher child-care costs; we are going to implement our flawed accreditation and guidelines and you can suffer the consequences'. It is saying that privacy is just a word to this government. And what if the private sector boycotts accreditation? In a climate where demand for formal child-care places is largely outstripping supply, how would the government face up to thousands of parents being denied fee relief because their child-care centres refused to comply with these flawed guidelines? The government must come to its senses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns are with privacy, with the cost increases and with the impact that this will have on low income and disadvantaged parents. Our concerns are about the effect on the eligibility of parents to fee relief if the non-government sector decides to stay outside the system. We are also concerned that the review in 12 or 18 months time by the minister is worthless because it is a joke for the minister to be reviewing her own program. At the very least, a review of the guidelines must be conducted by an independent person or body. If there is $11 million to spend over four years on accreditation, it could be spent in more practical ways, including greater assistance for special needs children, such as those from a non-English speaking background or those with behavioural disorders. Yet the government drags its feet on meeting these very important needs. I urge all honourable senators to reject the guidelines currently before us. </PARA>

Very large numbers of them are already registered and in the process of trying to tackle the opening stages of the steps that they need to take for the accreditation process. The latest figures that I have to hand are that, since registration started on 1 January, over 500 centres have registered with the Child-care Accreditation Council, and about 48 to 49 per cent of those are private centres. One could say that near enough to half of the centres that have registered come from each sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Senate is seriously going to deliberate on this, it is important to know that the objections to accreditation are not coming uniformly from across the industry and they are not coming uniformly from across the private part of the industry; they are coming from small sections of the industry. Indeed, the persistent objections are based in large part, as in the first debate, on misinformation. This is not assisted by Senator Newman's contribution, which perpetuated some of that misinformation. Unlike Senator Newman, I will not say at this stage that she intends to do it deliberately&mdash;the sort of accusation that she passes about the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two points in particular need to be raised today. Firstly, I thank my colleagues Senator Lees and Senator Chamarette for their contribution and for their consistent view. I particularly draw the attention of honourable senators to the speech made by Senator Lees, in which she has, in a very thoughtful and detailed way, debunked most of the claims about the extraordinary costs that will be held against child-care centres if they implement the accreditation process. It seems impossible for the opposition to understand and accept what I say&mdash;that matters of state regulation are not part of accreditation and therefore are not able to be part of the costs of accreditation. Indeed, they insist that I am a liar. That, I think, shows a very insufficient understanding of what state regulations are about, and I would commend to the opposition a reading of Senator Lees' paper. She makes it very clear, spelling it out in a very useful way. If it is listening to me that upsets opposition members, they should read Senator Lees' contribution and follow thoughtfully the issues she raised and the statements she makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost issue has got legs, and I am rather pleased to say that we now have some better understanding of the basis for the claims made by the opposition about the costs. We in the government had been waiting for any of those documents to be provided. I am pleased to say that we have access to some of them following the tabling of some documents by Senator Boswell, although the documents he tabled were very insufficient. I do not know whether they were the documents that were provided to him, but certainly as they came to us from the tabling they were insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the opportunity to examine some of those documents. In light of our examination of the Taylor report in particular, and with the analysis by Senator Lees of other reports, quite clearly the claims that I have been making about costs are very much substantiated. In particular, it is more important to try to wait until the beginning of the implementation of accreditation and to see the process in action rather than rely on hypotheses that people can conclude either from advice given to them or on the basis of the decisions they make from reading the guidelines. Let us remember that, notwithstanding the limitations of the study, the Pitcher findings of costings was based on the actual process of accreditation being implemented in real live centres, in real live time, with real live people; it was done across a variety of private and public centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the government nor I has ever claimed that it is a perfect document and that those figures are absolute, but they are a very useful basis for a working document from which one could begin to estimate or `guesstimate' the costs of the accreditation process in centres. I very much endorse the comments of Senator Lees that, if centres are going to worry about the cost of smiling at children or having a warm relationship with children, or learning to speak to children differently, then one can only wonder about the standard of care that would be in those centres at the moment. I also wonder how one could begin to understand why it would cost anything to help people smile. I am concerned that centres would feel that they have to introduce a cost for such processes. As Senator Lees says, they make one worry about what might be the standard of care out there. I do not believe there is much more I should say about cost&mdash;I might come back to it&mdash;because, as I have said, this matter has been very well canvassed, and refuted, by Senator Lees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days the issue of privacy has emerged as something on which a further attack against these guidelines could be made. It is important to place on the record some of the facts, the rulings and the evidence we have about privacy, as well as information relating to the accreditation council. The National Childcare Accreditation Council has been having discussions with the Privacy Commissioner since last November to ensure that all its procedures are conducted under privacy guidelines. The council started those discussions as a result of conversations it had with the department. Essentially, the concerns that the department had that came up in discussions with the National Childcare Accreditation Council led to further discussions with the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Newman commented, Quentin Bryce was a colleague of the Privacy Commissioner and is extraordinarily well placed to be aware of concerns about privacy. So suggestions by Senator Newman that the government has deliberately tried to construct this council in a certain way so as to dodge privacy issues is drawing a very long bow; it is a very poor attempt by Senator Newman to make much of nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the concerns about privacy. National Childcare Accreditation Council material produced for the purpose of gathering data includes a notation approved by the Privacy Commissioner. That notation indicates where the information will be available, where it can be used and by whom, and so on. All of the staff of the National Childcare Accreditation Council sign confidentiality agreements and all departmental officers involved in the accreditation are subject to the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to pick up this interesting point in a certain way, but in light of the letter that Senator Newman read, it is important to say that the Privacy Commission has sent advice, firstly, that of course the National Childcare Accreditation Council and the information involved would be a matter of concern from the privacy perspective; and, secondly, that if there were the prospect that the way the National Childcare Accreditation Council had been set up meant it could then fall outside the Privacy Act, that would be of concern. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today I have received advice from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that makes it absolutely clear that, constituted as it is, the National Childcare Accreditation Council is covered by the Privacy Act, and all the obligations and responsibilities pertaining to information and data that go with that act. So the concerns that have been raised can be laid to rest. The Attorney-General's advice makes it quite clear that the National Childcare Accreditation Council is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act; that is, the Attorney-General rules that it is covered on the ground that it is defined as an agency under subsection 6(1)(d) of the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am very pleased to be able to assure senators with honourable, and senators with perhaps not quite so honourable, concerns about matters of privacy. I can give that assurance to the Democrats because I know it has consistently been a matter of concern for them as well as the Greens.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privacy is a matter of concern which I think has been honourably raised by many of those opposite. I would like to be able to give them the assurance that the National Childcare Accreditation Council is covered by the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines have been on the table for four months. This is not an issue of concern that has been raised by anyone previously. I have to say that those who have been most concerned about it have been the department and the National Childcare Accreditation Council. Processes have been put in place to make sure that the proper behaviour about all and any information coming to the National Childcare Accreditation Council is established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another point about privacy. The National Childcare Accreditation Council is covered by the Privacy Act. However, I am advised that the proposed reviewers who will be appointed to review the self-assessment of centres will not be covered by the Privacy Act. The National Childcare Accreditation Council is developing now a code of ethics for reviewers in close consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. The reviewers, I assure the Senate, will not be doing any work at all, and will not exist, until after July 1994 at the very earliest. So we do have a good lead time to make absolutely sure that the privacy provisions covering every other part of the national child-care accreditation process will also cover the reviewers; and, as I have said, the code of ethics will be well in place before that time. I cannot stress too strongly that those centres that have concern about matters of privacy&mdash;and properly so&mdash;can be assured by the information and the advice that I have received from the Attorney-General about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note&mdash;and there are many examples of this&mdash;that when systems are established people sometimes see things that, with the best will and intention in the world, were not picked up earlier by any number of people canvassing such matters. The issue of privacy has been under the cover of the Privacy Act since it was established. I am very pleased to give the assurance to people who have raised the matter that the Privacy Act is in place and, with the exception of the reviewers, its requirements do cover the areas of the National Childcare Accreditation Council. The requirements in respect of reviewers will be in place by the time they come into operation in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few points about costs. I am not sure whether Senator Lees covered the cost of translations. One of the claims under the Taylor costings assumes that every service would have to translate information into every one of the 10 languages suggested. In fact, that is not the case, and anyone with commonsense and understanding would know that that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need for translation facilities for parents and children of centres needing no language other than English. A centre with children largely from one ethnic background would clearly need a translation facility for that one language requirement. It is important to know that some of these claims are either maximum or hyper-inflated. There is no requirement on centres to translate into either every language or into 10 languages; but there may well be a need for more than one language. To suggest that the costings can be worked out on every centre having to produce translation in 10 languages leads to wrong conclusions about the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to consider the estimate of 88c. For the benefit of Senator Troeth, I want to make it clear on the record that I was not claiming any tested authorship for 55c. The government's consultant estimate is 88c. I was merely referring to a centre in South Australia which had tried to go through the accreditation process as best it could, and its estimate was 55c. I place no more store on the figures provided by a well-intentioned senator than what I said publicly in this place. I understood Senator Troeth to have represented those figures differently this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that the 88c is based on the independent consultant's assessment of services that were actually participating in the pilot scheme. All other costings that we have had so far are based on a number of assumptions of what is expected of centres in accreditation. Those assumptions made no reference to the National Childcare Accreditation Council. There have been no phone calls asking whether the assumptions were right, or seeking reflecting information&mdash;indeed, no-one in these centres has actually experienced the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs incurred by centres during the actual process will probably differ from the guesses in just about every way. For instance, if the guess is about translation costs, as I read out, then clearly it will be different. It is very important to allow accreditation to get up and running and to allow the cost estimates to emerge from the actual cases rather than assumptions claimed from reading the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat my commitment that I will evaluate the system after the first 12 months of the process. That evaluation will clearly include an assessment of costs, particularly the cost impact on any centres. In the meantime, I have made it very clear to the National Childcare Accreditation Council that I want it to closely monitor the experience of services participating in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that this accreditation debate will be assisted by prolonging the possibility of disallowance. Since the guidelines failed to be disallowed in December, a sense of, `Let's get on with the process' has emerged from the child-care industry. Already, over 500 centres have registered with the childcare accreditation council and almost half of that number are private centres. I have confirmation in many letters to my office of the number of private centres that have been appalled at the misinformation in attacking the guidelines and accreditation. Those centres are eager to participate and to make their contribution because they know very well that involvement in accreditation&mdash;the ability to say, `We are an accredited centre'&mdash;is just the sort of assurance a good, private business would like to have said about itself. That is exactly what those private centres want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to note that one of the speakers today from the opposition suggested that with accreditation people will withdraw investment in private child care. I can assure the Senate that at the moment child care is a very favoured area for investment. Those people who are looking for somewhere to put their money are being advised that investment in private child-care centres is a very good option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understood Senator Newman to say that many such investors are concerned at investing in a good small business, a good private child-care centre. One of the best hallmarks of a good private child-care centre is the assurance to all potential parents and their children that the centre is a quality one&mdash;`With our accreditation process we can assure you that we are providing a very good service. We are concerned both for our business and for the care of our children that we are accredited'. Many private centres are pleased to get into this area as soon as they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that genuine objections and difficulties encountered by people confronting accreditation are dealt with and not lost in this hype of awful furphies about accreditation. I am comforted in knowing that, since the disallowance was not successful last December, many of the centres are now getting on with the business of addressing the process and many of their concerns are being laid to rest. I hope that is the way we can proceed from here, rather than have today's claims in the child-care area causing more anxiety and confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remind Senator Troeth that if there are salary costs as a result of state licensing requirements, then that is not part of accreditation. Senator Newman thought it was interesting that we should add something to the state licensing requirements. I am not absolutely sure but I think it was Senator Newman who challenged me by saying, `Ask your state colleagues'. I will certainly give due consideration to that request. I can imagine Senator Newman saying, `How dare you interfere with the states' in any other debate in this place&mdash;`What do you mean? Why is the Commonwealth poking its nose into state licensing requirements?'. If Senator Newman wants me to take that request seriously, I will take up the issue and make inquiries sensitive to the state licensing responsibilities. It is not a bad idea, especially in light of the information provided to the Senate by Senator Lees from her examination of some of the claims by centres in Queensland. Claims are being made by centres across this country, most of which would be assisted by fact and not a proffered fiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state licensing regulations are not part of accreditation. The costs of state licensing cannot be used against accreditation. We assess the cost of accreditation of a centre as 88c plus or minus a little bit per child because we are realistic about the need to implement some of those changes at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman said that accreditation, by and large, does not duplicate state licensing requirements. Senator Newman is absolutely right&mdash;it does not duplicate state licensing requirements. It is a matter of grave concern for the government, which is why we are introducing accreditation for staff ratios and guidelines for the physical environment of children, the relationship between staff and children, the content of a child's day, and safety and health matters. Those matters go to the heart of quality child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the objections are very amusing for any of us who have been around for a few years and visited pre-schools, child-care centres and kindergartens where these practices have largely been the name of the game for very many years now. Indeed, the Lady Gowrie centres were established by Lady Gowrie in 1939 as a result of concern for quality care of children. The government believes that child-care centres should practice that kind of comfortable and loving care for our children. The primary concern is for quality care for our children in those centres where they can spend very long hours. Also, as Senator Chamarette said, very large amounts of money are being spent now on child care. Properly, the government wants to be able to account for those dollars being appropriately spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe we have been assisted in the accreditation process by re-running this disallowance debate. It is very much a re-run. The issue was put to bed last December. It allowed the industry to shake itself down and get on with the process of accreditation. I hope we can vote and finish this debate in a moment, once and for all, and allow the accreditation process to start. We will then be able to evaluate it on the run, in real life experience, in real centres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Let me say to Senator Crowley that, as responsible opposition senators, if we had just one objection to the guidelines, we would voice it. I would feel it my responsibility to do so. As we have had more than one objection, that is exactly what we are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns, as evidenced by the speeches of the other two coalition speakers, Senator Newman and Senator Boswell, have been to do with the costings that I evidenced this morning, privacy and the impact on low income earners. We are talking about people's livelihoods. We are talking about the people who run the centres&mdash;they act as small businessmen&mdash;and the welfare of the children and families who use them. Both those groups of people have considerable concerns with what has been introduced in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that Senator Lees did appreciate the substantive nature of our arguments. The reason we did decide to have a re-run of this debate, as Senator Crowley has put it, is that sufficient doubt has been cast on the costings since we last had this debate for us to raise the matter again. That is why we have done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to staff needing language training, I point out to Senator Crowley that in some primary schools, particularly in the inner Melbourne area, something like 13 to 14 languages are spoken in the playground. Unfortunately, primary schools, secondary schools and day-care centres do not slip easily into a preconditioned mould of conveniently having one, two or three languages. In the melting pot that is our civilisation in Australia today we have many languages to cope with. Day-care centres should not be any different in that role from primary or secondary schools. We will need at least the 10 languages and probably the 10 pages of instructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees also mentioned the professional and legal responsibility that day-care centres will have. From some of the press reports of the non-education of professional staff these days in areas such as legal responsibilities generally and rights in harassment situations or under harassment charges, for example, I believe that day-care centre staff will need to take a great deal of professional and legal responsibility, particularly as we seem to be moving into a society that takes litigation very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More education is needed. It would have to be of such a standard that I could not imagine it taking place in the workplace. I can only imagine that extra professional courses would be required. All of that would add to the cost.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Lees that special needs should be catered for. That is one area in which very professional training is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees also agreed with me that an increase of $5 a week is too high. Five or six dollars a week extra money for child care can make or break the economic budgets of many low income families. Many of these parents, both mothers and fathers, place their children in day care because they need to earn a second income to get their family budget to balance, particularly over the last couple of years in the recession that we had to have. If they are faced with paying extra money for child care, and as we have seen this morning $5 or $6 is an extremely conservative estimate, they may well consider other avenues of child care. It is all very well to say that is a very low amount. For some families it is not a very low amount. I would like to remind Senator Crowley of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Senator Chamarette is well intentioned, but she does appear to be hoping for the best. We are saying that onerous guidelines will impose financial burdens on centres and parents. How do we address the concerns after the guidelines are in place? The proper place to express our concerns about the guidelines is here and now, while this legislation still has the chance to be amended. I would not like to be trying to address the concerns and change the guidelines in 12 or 18 months' time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care centres are the very last places that should be thrown into turmoil as far as administration and the way they should be run. To say that we will do this now, and then change the system if it does not work properly, is one of the worst administrative ideas I have ever heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government apparently is unable to realise that acquiescence and compliance with the guidelines will impose financial burdens. This is what we should be looking at. If costs rise, parents will seek alternatives and place children at further risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman outlined very well our concerns about privacy. As she said, the guidelines illustrate the government's cavalier response. We believe there is strong and widespread opposition. The bodies that have expressed their concerns to us are responsible bodies that look after child-care centres. They would not be expressing these concerns if they did not feel strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course Senator Crowley could cite the number of child-care centres that have registered for operation. As I said in my remarks this morning, they have no option. They do not like it, but they have to go along with it. That is why large numbers are registering. I am glad that Senator Crowley admits that there are some objections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about concrete changes, not intangibles. Senator Crowley mentioned that it does not cost much to smile or talk positively to children. It does cost to change the structure of a child-care centre and to start reversing the way in which it has been operated for years. It all costs money. I will not go on further, because I think I have well established the coalition's concerns. We would like to see these guidelines disallowed. I therefore ask honourable senators to support me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with document No. 1, the Australian Securities Commission annual report for 1992-93. I do not want to deal with it at length, but the first point I want to make is simply that I am glad to see that in its annual report the Australian Securities Commission expresses great regret that two of its senior executives were found by the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges to have committed a contempt of parliament which, by the way, resulted in no penalty being recommended. The annual report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC has apologised to the Senate and is ensuring that all senior staff are aware of the principles governing the operation of Parliament, particularly the rights and responsibilities of, and protection afforded to, witnesses before parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that it happened. It should not have happened, but at least now the Securities Commission is aware of its duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with another matter relating to duty, and that is its duty to ensure that all the information in its database relating to companies is accurate and that the provision of that information is timely. The source of this information is company annual returns, which company secretaries are obliged to put in on time, and they should be accurate. The Securities Commission report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC has actively encouraged company secretaries to ensure that Annual Returns are accurate and lodged on time.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a longstanding problem in promoting compliance with these requirements, based perhaps on perceptions that lodgement was difficult, the requirements unclear or that no action would be taken for non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence, that was the perception, and it seems to have been what encouraged people such as Mr Constantinidis, Mr Keating's business partner in his multimillion dollar multinational piggery group, to treat this requirement with utter contempt. I raised today the matter of one of his companies that has not put in an annual return for six years. Of course, the piggery group companies themselves have not put in annual returns that were timely, and the bulk of them, I understand, have received penalty notices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of penalty notices is very important. The annual report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1992 the ASC started a summary prosecutions program aimed at improving the quality of the database. 118,000 penalty notices were sent to secretaries of companies which had not lodged Annual Returns for 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's piggery group is among that 118,000. I have a letter from Lynn Ralph, the acting chairperson of the ASC, saying that although no penalty notice in respect of late lodgment of annual returns has been sent to the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd itself, penalty notices have been issued to other companies within the group. That is disgraceful. The annual report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notice stated that if the company failed to act on the penalty notice the ASC would start legal proceedings. About 50,000 penalties were paid, 12,500 penalties were cancelled, and the rest grouped into various priority categories for summary prosecution in State and Territory courts. During the year 8565 summary prosecutions were begun, with 8133 matters concluded.</PARA>
<PARA>I am disappointed that the ASC took the view that some of the companies in the Prime Minister's piggery group did not merit this kind of prosecution because the letter that was sent by Mr Constantinidis to apologise was simply misleading and I believe the ASC was wrong in accepting that misleading letter as some kind of justification. It is disappointing to note in the letter from Lynn Ralph the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of 1990 and a number of 1991 late annual returns, the ASC issued only warning notices, including to BHG, as there had been little follow up under the former Corporate Affairs Commissions. In 1991 the ASC compliance section had to design, await the building of and test the automated follow up system and as a result action was not taken in all instances.</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the effectiveness of this, the ASC is expecting that next year only about 65,000 penalty notices will be issued for failure to lodge 1992 annual returns on time. I notice that, following the experience of the Prime Minister's half-owned company piggery group, the Brown and Hatton group put in its 1992 returns on time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address very briefly document No. 6, the 1992-93 report of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Senator Woodley is listed as being in continuation, and I thought he would have finished off what he had to say. I would like the Senate to note that there is a belief in the wool industry that there is an improvement. Of course there is an improvement; there is a slight improvement from the basic price that has been around for quite a few years now. Having gone down to the depths of despair, the price is starting to turn around. But it is nowhere near the figure that we need for it to be a viable industry, especially when producers totally rely on wool as an income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did quite a tour of the southern Nullarbor pastoral industry and the eastern goldfields pastoral industry over the break and I found that most of those stations are in a care and maintenance situation. They are keeping the improvements up and the numbers of stock up, but there are certain things that they are not able to do. They are not able to make any improvements to their structures. They are not able to do new fencing. As honourable senators might have heard, there were a lot of bushfires in the Nullarbor that burnt a lot of fencing down. Fortunately, all of those were insured and they are able to replace the fences. What the people in the pastoral industry did impress upon me&mdash;not that I did not know before&mdash;is the present price. The last price I was given was about 536c a kilo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have a viable wool industry, we have to return to around 700c a kilo. When we do&mdash;I can see it coming; probably in a couple of years time&mdash;that industry will be very viable, not only for the pastoral industry but for the wool industry that is run alongside the cropping situation. We had a new scheme put in place in the wool industry some six- or eight-odd months ago&mdash;maybe a little longer than that&mdash;under the stewardship of Mr Crean, who was minister for primary industry at the time. What I would like to impress on the industry and everyone is that we cannot depart from the arrangements that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool production is down this financial year to 717 million kilos for the year. More is being sold. There is more coming out of the stockpile, and I believe that that situation, having been fixed, has to stay. There is no going back on that one. That is what wrecked the old scheme. Honourable senators may remember when Mr Kerin ran around the world and said that 700c was unchangeable, and then all of a sudden it was gone. There was a lot of damage and a lot of confidence was lost at the time. No matter how tough things are, even though the stations and others are on care and maintenance, we must stay where we are and look forward to better times. </PARA>

He was described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as `the farmer's friend'. I wish Mr Kerin well in his new job as head of the AMLC, but I would not call him a farmer's friend, not after what he did to some of our rural industries, and to the wool industry in particular. While I wish him well in his new venture, those of us associated with the wool industry will remember him for the damage that he did rather than for the good that he did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Essentially, this report was nothing more than a general description of the IMF. It said little about the changes that were consequent to the ninth general review. It did not talk about what the IMF is doing about the ongoing problems of international debt. It did not talk about what the IMF is going to do to promote exchange stability or to maintain orderly exchange arrangements. It did not mention how the IMF was going to promote and maintain high levels of employment and income of member nations. I suggest that this was because the IMF is actually doing nothing about these issues, beyond blindly imposing fundamentalist economic policy on poor nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IMF is well known for two things. First, it demands of borrowers that they deregulate their economies in response to the cynical argument that free trade is good. Frequently, this deregulation consists of eliminating barriers to imports of consumer goods, such as imported alcohol, and opening barriers to international fund transfers. The first measure simply exacerbates international debt, while the second generally results in capital flight as the wealthy elite stash their money in banks in Europe and in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the IMF's frequent solutions is to impose austerity programs&mdash;demanding cuts to social infrastructure such as education, health and so on&mdash;which it calls `reduction of public expenditure'. This frequently results in a decline in the ability of the work force to compete for trained jobs and an increase in political instability. It is worth noting that only rarely do cuts in public expenditure extend to cuts in military expenditure, which is often a major source of international expenditure in poor developing nations. More ominously, such cuts almost never extend to reducing internal police and paramilitary expenditure, in spite of sometimes appalling records of human rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brandt report on trade and debt, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North/South</EMPHASIS>, produced in 1980, and the Brundtland report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS>, produced in 1987, and many other international reports have pointed out that the IMF and the World Bank are often major culprits in maintaining and reinforcing poverty, misery and maldevelopment and that they are in urgent need of reform. Yet we hear of no plans for reform nor for dealing with the international debt and its problems. Both reports have also pointed out that under the regime of deregulation and so-called free trade, poor nations have become poorer, the difference between the rich and the poor in all nations has become greater, and that this has exacted an increasing price from the local and global environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of the IMF is supposed to be a stabilisation of currencies. Today the biggest element of instability in currency is speculation&mdash;what is known as short-term financial transactions. Currency and bond speculation is a result of international deregulation of the financial markets and fund transfers. It boomed during the 1980s to a level where the scale of the market for currency speculation was about 40 times that of all real goods and services globally. It is a speculation run on the big cash holders&mdash;commercial banks, merchant and investment banks, insurance and superannuation companies, and stock brokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have seen this speculation destabilise European currency in the run-up to the EC attempt at creating a common currency. Again we have seen how this sector can dominate Australian and Japanese currency. What will the IMF do about this? Where is the plan to promote exchange stability? There is no plan. There is only the blind adherence to deregulation, as if deregulation was not the major source of the problem. It may not have been the source of such problems when the IMF was set up at the end of the colonial period, but times have changed. Instead of any plan of stabilisation, which is a worthy goal, we see blind adherence to deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to note especially that further deregulation of the financial sector, or financial services, is one of the two major goals of the Uruguay Round of GATT&mdash;the other child of Bretton Woods, along with the imposition of the US patent system under the intellectual property rights. In this context, we feel that the report tabled is entirely inadequate. As noted, it is simply a summary of what the IMF is; it says nothing about the major problems faced by developing nations and what it will do. It says nothing about the major problem of currency speculation, even though it is clearly in the IMF brief to promote exchange stability. It says nothing at all about plans to reform the IMF&mdash;in fact, it says almost nothing at all. That is simply not good enough. In the future I expect to see reports that actually convey information about how the International Monetary Fund is addressing these problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is noted that in 1988 the bank decided that the amount of money made available to nations should be increased by 77 per cent. The bank asked for subscriptions from wealthy members. Australia subscribed to less than three-quarters&mdash;74 per cent&mdash;of its shares, following its practice of putting less than the recommended amounts into any sort of foreign aid.

He cannot understand why developed nations, which are not forced to, do not impose their own austerity measures. </PARA>

I believe that there are many positive recommendations for improving the current management problems that beset our coast. There is only one problem that I wish to deal with.

To reinforce some of my comments, I ask honourable senators to take note of the dissenting report of Special Commissioner R.J. Graham. Whilst not wishing to condemn the report, he asked that some of its recommendations should be viewed with greater seriousness so that they could be taken a few steps further. The Special Commissioner said:</PARA>

To do so it has to be stressed that it is not resources which need to be managed. What is needed is management of the ways in which people use and develop resources. This may be an obvious point but it seems to have been missed by the Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Special Commissioner continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attempted to make these connections by outlining development guidelines and management proposals in considerable detail.

The report recommends that state governments require all authorities responsible for the supply and disposal of water and other waste to take urgent steps to introduce charges that reflect the costs of supplying these services. It goes on to recommend the use of tradable permit systems to meet water quality criteria. We are concerned that to simply put in place two economic instruments will do very little to stop pollution of our waterways.

<PARA>The annual report of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories raises again the issue of the Kelly sports grants affair and this government's continuing manipulation and abuse of the public purse. I think the shabbiest thing about this whole sports grants affair is that the government has been exposed as trying to bribe Australians with their own money. That is the saddest part of all. In fact, it is the most flagrant display of public vote buying ever seen in Australia. It is also a tale of flagrant ministerial abuse of responsibility by the honourable member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly, which has gone shamefully unchecked by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke at lunchtime on another element of this particular rort. Senator Michael Baume drew to my attention the fact that he had raised this issue some two years ago and yet nothing has ever been done about it. The fact that Labor was twice as generous in handing out its taxpayer-funded grants in its own seats as it was to the marginal seats held by the coalition smacks at the very least of gross mishandling of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly became a political philanthropist in her own electorate. The only problem was that she was giving away the public's money&mdash;money that, according to the sports grants criteria, should have been spent in other seats. Labor seats in Western Australia are among those at the end of this taxpayer-funded vote buying exercise. The federal seats of Perth and Swan&mdash;occupied by the former prime ministerial adviser and now prime ministerial aspirant, Stephen Smith, and Kim Beazley, the Minister for Finance and honourable member for Swan&mdash;came in for some extra-generous funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report found that an incredible $604,635 went into the seat of Perth and $542,562 into Swan. On the basis of these grants, it cost the government a scandalous $1,845.44 per winning vote in Swan and $72.22 per winning vote in Perth. I should not say that it cost the government&mdash;it cost taxpayers. It was their money. It cost $1,800 to win a vote in Swan and $72 to win a vote in Perth. In the seat held by the Assistant Treasurer, George Gear, the Kelly sports grants factor was worth a massive $406,592, leaving the taxpayer with a bill of $1,666.36 per winning vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no shame among members of the Labor party. They have no shame whatsoever that they can fork out that sort of money. Former Labor Minister Wendy Fatin's seat of Brand received grants totalling $432,637&mdash;a cost of $77.80 per winning vote. Between Western Australia's marginal seats of Brand, Canning, Swan and Perth, more than $19 million was spent on shoring up Labor stalwarts, including Mr Beazley, Mr Gear, Mrs Fatin and Mr Smith. On the other hand, in the seat of Stirling&mdash;which was written off by many Labor pundits before the last election&mdash;only $80,000 was outlaid by the government in sports grants. The government made a sort of halfway bet, I suppose; knowing that it was going to lose, it did not bother to put much into that seat. In the seat of Cowan, which Labor had also all but conceded it would lose, only $30,000 was spent. This compares with $45,000 which was spent on one project alone in Mrs Kelly's electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going on figures from Mrs Kelly's own electorate, a sports club or an organisation of which the minister was a member, was in for a funding bonanza. Mrs Kelly made it quite clear that a grant of $100,000 was nothing for her. Of course, honourable senators will have guessed that, as it turned out, Mrs Kelly is a member of a number of these organisations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind honourable senators that the national forest policy statement was agreed to by all governments in Australia except Tasmania. Under the agreement there is supposed to be a moratorium on logging old growth forests and wilderness areas that are likely to have high conservation value until those areas have been properly assessed. Yet, the DEST annual report makes no mention of the fact that there are flagrant breaches of the intergovernmental agreement occurring in a number of states. Where are the performance indicators for this agreement that the Commonwealth has signed? Why have woodchip licences been issued by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) with no apparent consideration for the requirements of the national forest policy statement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report also refers to technical working groups that have been established to identify criteria for developing a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of reserves in forests and to establish baseline environmental standards. I would like to stress to both the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Resources that the draft documents prepared by these working groups must be put out for public discussion and comment before being finalised for presentation to governments. Community interest groups have considerable interest in the criteria for forest reserves and in the baseline environmental standards, and their input would be invaluable. </PARA>

<PARA>I have not had the opportunity to examine this report in detail, but I was horrified to read in the overview the author's claim that the practical ability to manage waste comes in part from the ability to generate a surplus from everyday economic activity. It is an astounding statement. It appears that the Industry Commission is convinced that we need to continue to produce waste and pollution so that we can afford to clean up the mess. This philosophy lies at the heart of the problem facing the nation and this planet as we approach the end of the 20th century. There appears to be no commitment to address the fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there appears to be some discussion in the report about the need to avoid or reduce pollution, the emphasis is placed on economic instruments to achieve this end. The enormous environmental problems in this country and overseas will require creative solutions that address the fundamental problems. We cannot afford to continue to rely on half-baked solutions or the vagaries of the market. We cannot, for example, rely on waste water or sewerage treatment in isolation when there are fundamental solutions available that aim to minimise sewerage or water use and acknowledge the ecological limitations of the regions in which these systems operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oft-quoted analogy with the human body is appropriate: if a person is diagnosed as having heart problems, continuous bypass surgery is not appropriate if the lifestyle issues that probably caused the heart problem are not addressed. I should stress, however, that I do not under-value the opportunities for environmental waste management equipment, systems and services, particularly with respect to export. My concern is that the government may not have the commitment to also pursue the fundamental solutions to environmental problems rather than relying on bandaid options. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this very clearly in the pollution that is now having very detrimental effects on rivers all over Australia, and now in Western Australia as well.

<PARA>I shall take advantage of this opportunity to make some comments about the regulator of the superannuation industry, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The ISC has provided invaluable assistance to the parliamentary committee that oversees this process, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Indeed, the close cooperation that has dominated the relationship between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the parliamentary committee on superannuation has meant that many of the difficulties that often arise in the passage of legislation through the parliament have been minimised. I take this opportunity of mentioning that the committee has also worked extremely successfully with industry and consumer groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of the last session of parliament, the package of bills known as the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bills&mdash;commonly referred to as the SIS bills&mdash;passed through the parliament. As has already been noted, this legislation will commence on 1 July this year and provide greater protection to members of superannuation funds in terms of prudential controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The smooth passage of this legislation through the parliament can be credited to the cooperation that I have mentioned which exists among the key groups in this field. This cooperation has been nurtured and promoted by the Select Committee on Superannuation to excellent effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also congratulate the ISC team on the constructive role it has played as the regulator. It has some very fine people working within it. At the same time, I think it is probably appropriate to indicate that the tone and the success of the ISC was very much set by the founding ISC commissioner, Mr Richard Beetham. During his career as ISC commissioner, he made an outstanding contribution towards the establishment and development of the commission. During his five-year term as commissioner he performed to the highest level of professional standards, often at the time with inadequate resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of resources created a massive work overload which was only overcome through the tireless dedication of Mr Beetham and his staff. There is no doubt that without Mr Beetham the ISC would not have developed into the organisation it is today. At the same time, I wish to commend and congratulate Mr Pooley on his role as commissioner and commend him on his leadership of the ISC during the passage of the SIS bills through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the assets in superannuation funds continue to grow, the work of the ISC becomes increasingly vital. We heard this week concern about the loss of superannuation benefits facing the employees of the McDonnell and East retail business. Throughout the past year the ISC has worked with a judicial manager in an attempt to ensure that the financial damage, for example, to Regal Life and Occidental Life policyholders would be minimised. It appears that the work of the manager and the ISC will result in a reasonable outcome for the policyholders. It is imperative that the ISC be proactive in preventing such disastrous situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many honourable senators will be aware, master trusts have been the subject of much public concern. Only recently I heard that one of the reasons for the rapid growth of these master trusts is the move to avoid much of the regulatory type of environment that has surrounded superannuation. It is activity such as this that will create the greatest challenges for the ISC in its role as regulator and protector of the country's retirement income. I therefore congratulate the ISC on its valuable work, and in particular on its cooperation with the Select Committee on Superannuation, and on its work as a regulator of the vast superannuation assets. Finally, I implore the ISC and all those involved in superannuation to be vigilant so as to provide needed security for their very valuable resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today I spoke to the annual report 1992-93 of the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 1. In its annual report the public sector superannuation scheme indicated it did not feel it was appropriate for it to participate in industry market surveys. This reluctance of the trustees of the funds to participate in the surveys was raised during Senate estimates by me last year. I am pleased to report that following the Budget estimates the trustees have given this matter their prompt attention. The board of trustees have established an internal monitoring process in that they have adopted a range of indexes which the fund managers are expected to outperform and against which performance is measured. The result of the fund's performance relative to these benchmarks is available to members every six months by means of a newsletter and the results are published in the board's annual report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It was pleasing to note, when reviewing the Industry Commission report, that the economic rationalist approach that has tended to dominate Industry Commission reports to date has been softened somewhat in this latest report by an expression of concern for the social justice aspects of this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting at this stage that this report should not be seen as the definitive and primary vehicle for the much needed reform of the public housing sector. There will need to be a broader and more long-term public process to pursue this reform, and I look forward to government initiatives in that regard. I think it is safe to say that many community organisations, together with the Greens, will applaud the fundamental finding of this Industry Commission report&mdash;it is not often that we are seen applauding an Industry Commission report&mdash;because it states that the provision of public housing, rather than cash payments and housing allowances, is the most cost-effective option for delivering housing assistance to people on low incomes. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes proposed to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement . . . which would restrict the commonwealth role to income support, leaving the states to finance housing provision. This will create the capacity for states to reduce the level of support and opens the door to a potential 50% reduction in the commonwealth contribution to public housing provision;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed rent setting arrangement is too complex, and will mean that tenants living in the inner city would be worse off;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Splitting property and tenancy management functions into different departments will make it far harder to respond to tenant needs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes to waiting lists which appear to be unworkable because of the difficulty in weighting different needs, the additional administrative burden created by proposed assessment panels and will lead to a greater welfarisation of public housing;</PARA>

<PARA>This motion refers specifically to the Industry Commission's report on public housing, and I acknowledge Senator Margetts's general comments on the tabling of that document. My motion goes further. The second part `recognises that the recommendations of the report will affect over one million low income households in Australia'. The motion then condemns the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, Mr Brian Howe, the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, and the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, for the action that they took in a joint press release at the time that this document was released. Their response was totally inadequate and certainly did not measure up to the fine principles, recommendations and findings of the report itself. In the fourth part of the motion I urge the federal Labor government to address the recommendations that have been made to it, rightly and properly, in the context of the 1994 federal budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government to date has not given public housing the attention it deserves. I was appalled to read in the press release by the ministers for housing and social security and the Assistant Treasurer which accompanied the report that they publicly acknowledged that the federal Labor government would not respond to the Industry Commission's recommendations until June 1994. What a disgrace. Here is a statement that refers to a response that is going to come in June. I ask honourable senators to contemplate the reason for that. The budget this year is in May, so a month later the government will make a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It simply cannot be argued that the federal government needs more time to address the pressing problems of public housing in Australia. The Industry Commission report that was tabled in January follows on from an interim report that has been on the table since August last year. And now the government says mincingly, `Please give us a bit more time; let it flow to a month after the federal budget'. What a disgrace. This government has absolutely no ability to address the problems raised by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas that need to be addressed urgently by the government include: expenditure to promote and facilitate public housing; housing assistance to people in crisis; the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program; the funding to modify community housing to meet the special needs of people with disabilities; the housing problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; the rent assistance measures for tenants in the private rental market so that, firstly, it declines as income increases and, secondly, is available to all low income tenants in the private rental market and, thirdly, is brought closer to rent rebates in the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have a right to know what their elected government is going to provide in the form of housing assistance&mdash;and the government is going to totally walk away from this. We have total chaos and confusion. One only needs to look at the budget overview for the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services that accompanied the 1993-94 federal budget. That overview properly recognises that in the area of housing the expenditure is in the order of $1.125 billion. That is over a billion dollars of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great proportion of that&mdash;probably about 90 per cent&mdash;is dedicated under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement which obviously needs radical review. That is addressed in one paragraph of that overview. On the following seven pages of the document we get all of the little petty cash items that the government wants to pick up and claim credit for. I stress, it is a review of the mortgage and rent assistance program. With export strategy, because the housing industry has been faltering in Australia, the government wants to expend some $0.8 million for us to be competitive internationally. It is an important construction initiative, but not one that I would have put down as the second most important priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the government is going to provide the implementation of a housing choices strategy for older Australians&mdash;that is not addressing the fundamental problem. It is going to look at a national youth housing strategy for young people between the ages of 16 and 19 who, it claims, `obtain public housing at a rate disproportionately lower than any other age group', and where there is often a lack of consistency in the way they are treated by state housing authorities. The government wants to look at these 16- to 19-year-olds, not the fundamental issue of the family and how important it is. As I said, this confusion and chaos is constant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report, which is in two volumes, is an important document. It is concerned with accountability in the housing portfolio area. Concern is expressed&mdash;indeed, I would express concern&mdash;about the muscling in of the recommendations in this report between those that appeared first in the draft report last August and what has now appeared. There has been a shift in priorities. Very obviously ministers of the Crown, frightened that they will have to address some budget priorities and areas of accountability, have muscled in on the Industry Commission in the final report. These accountability recommendations have slipped seriously in the priority order. I wonder to what extent there has been subtle intervention by the ministers or departmental officers. I give notice that I will be pursuing that matter in the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has also commented recently on this whole area of accountability. In Audit Report No. 1, 1993-94, volume 6, there are some important issues. They highlight the fact that after a decade of Labor, the administration and accountability of Commonwealth-state housing programs is still in question. The Industry Commission's suggestions on accountability come on top of this very damning Auditor-General's report. In his report, the Auditor-General found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there remains scope for further enhancement to the Agreement (CSHA) and the manner in which it is administered.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's comments in the area of housing and planning drew attention to a range of issues and agreements between the Commonwealth and state governments that need addressing in the performance of Commonwealth-state housing agreements. We have had a decade of a federal Labor government. Thankfully, in the last couple of years we have seen the state Labor governments falling over, but very obviously leaving us with the particular problems that led the Auditor-General to raise the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now need to ask: where is housing in Australia after a decade of Labor? What rules, regulations and arrangements between Commonwealth and state ministers have been put in place? There is a paucity of results. Billions of dollars of Commonwealth money that has been injected into housing has not met the essential need. I was alarmed at the last round of Senate estimates when officers of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services came forward and admitted that they had not responded to the recommendations with any degree of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Industry Commission recommendations for the housing industry. As I said in my opening remarks, the recommendations will affect over one million low income households in Australia receiving housing assistance from the Commonwealth and state governments. There are genuine battling families living in cities, suburbs, towns, villages and communities throughout Australia. It is interesting to note that figure of one million low income earners and also to note the current unemployment figure in Australia of around one million. I wonder to what extent there is a comparability and compatibility between those two disaffected groups. Many of these families that I am referring to in the disaffected low income groups have a mother, a father, a brother, a sister or some other relative who is unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's report is a critical indictment of existing housing arrangements and highlights the need for urgent action in some very specific areas. It is a shocking report card on Labor's housing record. The recession has adversely affected large sectors of the Australian community. What on earth has Labor been doing to correct this, seeing that it induced the recession?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has deserted its own natural constituency in the area of underprivileged housing. The Industry Commission report acknowledges that many people have difficulty accessing appropriate and affordable housing, including people with disabilities, elderly people, young people, women and children escaping domestic violence and family breakdown, sole parents, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and migrants. The fact that the Industry Commission reveals that many needy people have fallen outside the traditional safety nets and government spending priorities shows the compounding relationship between unemployment and housing needs and the fact that the Labor government has failed to meet those needs. We need to look carefully at the whole program objectives which link the relationship between the Commonwealth and state areas and how they link up with employment generation in regions of high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the questions we asked at estimates recently showed us clearly that there were regions throughout Australia where the lack of housing and the high level of unemployment go hand in hand. A year after the program commenced the department was unable to adequately inform me of the number of houses built, the number of jobs created, where housing was located, and who in the Australian community benefited from the housing being built. There was $75 million brought forward from the Commonwealth-state housing agreement funds for this program in 1992-93, and although $52.6 million was spent in that year, another $22 million was carried over into 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell honourable senators what the Labor government has been doing in this area&mdash;it has been announcing review after review after review. I recently went through all of the budget papers and departmental documents in this area. It is fascinating. I have compiled a list of some three pages of reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an Australian and urban task force review; a Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act review; support for local government developing regionally based strategies; long term unemployment reviews; local government approvals reviews; Green street program; indicative planning review; a review of residential regulations; a way of looking at ways of reducing the cost structure to the housing industry; a model code for residential development; the better cities program&mdash;we all know how that failed; the housing choices strategy; the urban-export strategy; the integrated local areas planning; the House of Representatives report on patterns of urban settlement; the taxation and financial policy impacts on urban settlement and urban transport; the mortgage and rent assistance program; the community housing program; the review of the crisis accommodation program; the government's response to the report we are talking about; research by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute; the National Advisory Committee on Housing and Urban Development; the national youth strategy; the youth social justice strategy; studies on domestic violence; the job placement and training program; JPET pilot projects; the national information program informing tenants and landlords in the private rental market of their rights and obligations; and the development of a written code and practice for real estate agents. That is where the government has seen its priorities in housing, yet nothing has flowed from any of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers responding on behalf of the government did not address any of those particular issues. These urban review policies do absolutely nothing for the people living in high density public housing. They have been totally deserted. It was interesting to look at the recent result in the Werriwa by-election. During the campaign the Liberal candidate, Mr Charlie Lynn, was vehemently criticised by Labor Party politicians when he referred to Macquarie Fields housing commission area as a ghetto. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has no appropriate housing policies. Its policies of the past have not kept up with contemporary housing and demographic needs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Patterson rightly puts out, very expensive teak tables are put on the shopping list of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Industry Commission has acknowledged the failure of government to keep pace with the changing requirements of housing applicants. It is low income housing near employment and training opportunities that must be addressed. The Industry Commission acknowledged the need for greater efficiency from the public outlay of $2.5 billion in Commonwealth and state funds by re-jigging rental to reflect more accurately the income of tenants. The beneficiaries would be the genuinely needy tenants and the more than 200,000 would-be tenants on housing waiting lists around Australia&mdash;200,000 tenants who have not been accommodated by the government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people on low incomes who do not own their own homes and are unable to obtain public housing must either rent privately at high market rents or remain dependant on other family members. I had a constituency representation on that very issue today from my electorate in Darwin involving a tragic situation which brought home to me that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on low incomes who are not Department of Social Security clients may not be eligible for this important rent assistance. People with low incomes in many circumstances are spending in excess of 25 per cent of their income on private rental housing. Many people on low incomes are in a most unfortunate situation of living in continual financial crisis. That is having a catastrophic effect on Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government decision to defer a response to this important report dealing with the directions for general housing assistance reform until June 1994&mdash;after the federal budget&mdash;just shows how much clout the current minister, Mr Howe, has in this area. He has admitted defeat before the ERC has even met. Obviously, Minister Howe is a man under siege. It is only a matter of time before Carmen Lawrence replaces him not only as Deputy Prime Minister, but also as the relevant housing minister in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seriously doubt whether any of the recommendations of the Industry Commission's report on public housing will ever be implemented by a Labor government. It appears that they certainly will not be addressed with any degree of urgency in the 1994 budget. By the time the government responds to it&mdash;obviously some time later this year, after which we get into the subsequent 1995 budget round&mdash;this report will be closeted away, collecting dust on a bookshelf. The people we must be looking after are the people that I believe very rightly the Industry Commission has acknowledged as those in crisis. Dozens of excellent submissions were made, and dozens of recommendations and findings need to be addressed. All we get from this government is another series of reviews. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are always rather cautious not to be seen to be saying anything that might be construed as support for an Industry Commission report. However, in this particular case I believe that this report has been well done. It has not come out with the usual `privatise everything, and on anything that cannot be privatised limit government expenditure as much as possible'. The report is very thorough and well-considered, and I recommend it to anybody who is interested in public housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling's notice of motion refers to the effect of the IC report on over one million low income households in Australia. I certainly agree. Unfortunately, when we look at the Liberal Party's proposals, we wonder exactly where is its current policy. I remember that one of the planks in Fightback was to sell off large slabs, if not most, of the public housing stock. However, we have before us today a motion criticising the government's response to this Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report basically makes it clear that it is more cost-effective to provide low cost housing as well as housing assistance. Pleasingly for the Democrats, the idea of selling off stock has not been looked at as a serious or realistic option. The proposal for a voucher system for use in the private market also is not covered anywhere here as anything credible. I recommend that the Liberal Party looks very closely at many of these recommendations when formulating its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a substantial report which has obviously taken quite a bit of time and shows a lot of effort and work. All honourable senators would be correct to complain if the government response to this very detailed and well thought out document had been rushed. This was put down only a month before Christmas. Looking at the time frame, it is unrealistic to expect a full and considered response to this report in such a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, upon making the report public, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, Mr Howe, said that he would begin immediate consultations with the states to develop a new administrative regime in response to the areas of concern outlined in the report. On checking what stage this consultation process was at, I find that the first of these meetings took place in Adelaide two days ago. I am advised that a series of meetings will take place this month and that the report is the key item on the agenda for the ministerial council meeting at the end of February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling basically implied in his speech that it is somehow negligent of the minister not to respond before this year's budget. However, the existing Commonwealth-state housing agreement means that the housing funding is basically locked into this year's budget. I wonder whether Senator Tambling is suggesting that the Commonwealth should breach the agreement with the states to achieve whatever it is that we are looking for. Surely we should be looking ahead to getting a full and considered response in a new housing agreement which has to be drawn up in the subsequent year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas of concern raised by the commission's report were: tenancy management; housing allocation; rent setting; asset management; and accountability of the states in their administration of Commonwealth moneys. All of these need detailed and thorough consideration. These are all issues for a new Commonwealth-state agreement. Surely it is better for the minister to develop a thorough, new package rather than make an ad hoc response and patch up or in some way alter the current agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at Senator Tambling's press material, there is an inherent confusion about housing policy. The need for public housing will not go away whatever we do with first home buyer schemes or access to superannuation for people who are looking to buy their first home. In the real world, people without superannuation still need homes, and the private rental market is closed to many Australians. The need to stimulate growth in the economy at large by encouraging home ownership is a separate issue from the need for public housing. Indeed, we could just as well argue that, by stimulating the public housing sector, we would also stimulate the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is far and away the preferred option for the Democrats to put a large amount of money into public housing and in that way provide jobs right across Australia. When we compare the forms of assistance the government could offer to help people meet the need for shelter, the provision of public housing, according to the Industry Commission, overall ranks the highest in terms of accessibility, affordability, appropriateness, security of tenure and equity. The Democrats have always believed that provision of public housing of an adequate standard is the way to go for those who are not able to provide shelter for themselves. Indeed, it is a responsibility of government to ensure that its citizens are adequately housed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has commended the management of public housing in Australia in some respects and made recommendations for improvements in others. Nowhere in this report do I find wholesale condemnation of the government's policy direction. Yes, there are many problems, some of which Senator Tambling outlined, but this report does not condemn, as he did, the general policy direction. I would prefer the government to make refinements to its existing service delivery and accountability, as suggested by the report, in a considered way, rather than rush in. It is eminently sensible to put more money into public housing under the present structure than to pull that structure apart when we have a housing agreement already in place with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has overlooked another point in relation to this issue. It is the standard practice for there to be around about six months for a response to an Industry Commission report&mdash;certainly one of this size. The government's response will be accepted in roughly this time frame. The Democrats expect a considered and thorough response from government before the end of June. In the meantime, I commend the report to members of the opposition. I hope they will read it thoroughly and use it to correct their housing policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on Senator Tambling's motion. Picking up on the points made by Senator Lees, we have seen an enormous waste of time this afternoon. We expect that from the opposition, but this has to take the Logie&mdash;the big one. We are talking about a report that was tabled some three weeks ago. Senator Tambling is calling on immediate action to respond to that report. Fourteen days, 20 days or whatever is not a long time, particularly when we are talking about issues such as this. Senator Tambling could very easily have given a much more considered response. He could have spent more time considering it. Had he done that he would not have made those basic mistakes that Senator Lees talked about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much a fraudulent, knee-jerk response to this Industry Commission report&mdash;a report that does deserve much more consideration. This response is from an opposition which less than a year ago was going to the electorate with a policy on housing. It was a policy that, despite the crocodile tears here this evening, promised the Australian electorate a huge cutback in the area of public housing. The policy promised $450 million under the Fightback cutback proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of moral authority do members of the opposition think they have to cry crocodile tears within 12 months in such a snap response to a very detailed report? What we are seeing again, and what we have seen consistently since the last election, is an opposition which has not been prepared to do the hard work&mdash;before or since the election. The opposition consists of a bunch of amateurs. No matter how many of them are on the front bench, it will not raise the quality of the output. Within two weeks of the report coming down they are claiming instant responses and moral authority, when they wanted to cut away per capita housing through the Commonwealth-states agreement. What do they think a cut of $450 million would have done to the people of the Northern Territory or Werriwa, or to people on low incomes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one expects consistency from Senator Tambling, nor from the rest of the opposition. We on this side of parliament do not mind that, because the more that happens, the more likely we are to keep winning elections. We thank the opposition for the last five elections. What really stinks of hypocrisy is that those opposite, time and time again&mdash;particularly in this place&mdash;are screaming, wailing and crowing about states' rights. When we look at and analyse this report, what we see as the most basic, fundamental structure that the Industry Commission tries to tackle and analyse is state-federal responsibilities; their clarity and transparency, and the need for more transparency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do those opposite want us to do? They want us to come up with a response instantaneously, without consultation with state authorities. We have responded. Those ministers cited by Senator Tambling in his motion did respond, but they have responded in a more concrete way. That is unlike the simplistic approach to life and politics taken by Senator Tambling&mdash;particularly his approach to policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister responsible for this area has already moved quickly to establish processes for consultation with the state ministers. Arrangements with the states are in place already. Particularly under Senator Tambling's creed of politics there cannot be a unilateral decision to dump the states without consultation. The minister has organised consultations with state ministers. Bilateral discussions between the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) and his state counterparts will be held in mid-February. Housing ministers are to meet in late February to discuss the Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot I could say but I will not, given the time of day and the need to proceed to other business, but Senator Tambling has moved his motion without moral authority. He is critical of the federal government's response and, more particularly, he is critical of our record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing that the Industry Commission did do. This point was endorsed by Senator Lees but, unfortunately, in Senator Tambling's rush to read this report he must have missed the vital paragraph. I do not know why the opposition keeps some of those opposite on the front bench. In terms of talent they are not producing much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about rent assistance. Once again we think back to 12 months ago, when it was the opposition leader&mdash;the departing leader, Dr Hewson&mdash;who talked of people renting houses as being second-class citizens. That was the policy the opposition went to the last elections with. The opposition today is crying about those who may have to rent houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a record that, in bald terms, is reflected in the fact that we have increased total expenditure during our term of government from $500 million to over $1 billion in 1992-93. We have put in place agreements with the states to continue funding. It is a policy which, between March 1983 and September 1993, increased in real terms by 139 per cent assistance for eligible families with three or more children&mdash;from $10 a week to $42.60. We have committed funds, put in resources and worked with the states. We have had the reviews and we read the results. More importantly, we produce the funds to accommodate the need, unlike the policy of those opposite which, at the last election, was very clear: do away with federal government support for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's report, to the extent that it endorses anything, endorses the need for a mix of housing; a mix in terms of publicly owned housing and rental assistance. What the opposition's policy was then, and I do not know what it is now&mdash;we would all be surprised to hear what it is now&mdash;was to wipe the slate of one particular and important part of housing assistance; that is, public housing finance&mdash;$450 million less. That is the type of policy the opposition put up at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to go by that because there has not been a change, despite the endeavours of the opposition leader in this place to develop a policy think tank. There has not been a substantial addressing of these issues. The opposition criticises us for not giving sufficient import to these issues. It is not just the arrangements with the states that are important; but the fundamental issues that the commission raises, such as the transparency of funding arrangements and the greater clarity, objectives and responsibilities of both Commonwealth and state governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General is not the electorate. What the electorate said about us last year was quite different from what it said about the opposition. The opposition has candidates running around this country. I was in Werriwa just a week before the election. I did not see a ghetto; I saw a lot of concerned people. The end result in Werriwa was one of the lowest swings away from a government. Everyone in the electorate knows that last year was not a good year for us in terms of some of the issues we had to confront, but it was not a good year for Dr Hewson either. That is the bottom line for all members of the opposition sitting on the front bench, because Dr Hewson's time is limited and the time of those sitting on the front bench is limited. It is limited because the opposition cannot grasp the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission made assessments and put up proposals to look at the clear and full cost benefits of various tenures, the best levels and mix of assistance measures, and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Tambling's motion relating to the Industry Commission's recently released report into public housing. I welcome the opportunity to do so for a number of reasons but most particularly because I found the response of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, to Senator Tambling's speech just stunning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Bolkus had the hide to call the coalition hypocrites! I cannot believe that he had gall to do that, given that the government told pensioners that they would be taken out of the tax system by 1995, then five days after the election, the former Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said that that was some sort of a typo and that it was not right. The government had the temerity to tell people that there would be no increase in taxes, and then only yesterday we saw an increase in the tax on leaded and unleaded petrol. That was after the government had gone round the traps telling everyone that the coalition was going to do terrible things. After telling us that there would be no increases in taxes, the government increased the wholesale sales tax. For the minister to stand on that side of the chamber and call us hypocrites is simply astounding, but then nothing about the Labor government should astound us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for senior citizens and aged care and shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on women's affairs, I am concerned by the fact that the government has not seen fit to respond to this important report in the 1994-95 budget election. It seems that whenever there is an issue that comes up or report that is tabled we are to be told that it will not be dealt with in the new budget because it is being brought down earlier. That should have been taken into account when the cabinet decided to have an early budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A draft report was tabled in August of 1993. Yet Senator Lees&mdash;a member of the fifth faction of the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats&mdash;says, `Look, it is very difficult for the government to take the report into account in this budget because it has only just been brought down'. In fact, the government cannot respond because it already has agreements in place with the states. As early as August, the government was in receipt of a draft report that was very much along the lines of the final report. So Senator Lees' argument holds little if any water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of tardiness that the government is demonstrating in its response to this report&mdash;it knew what was going to happen because it already had the draft report&mdash;is not confined to this matter. The coalition is appalled by the apparent lack of political will demonstrated by some of the Labor ministers in responding to the shameful human rights abuses so lucidly highlighted in Commissioner Burdekin's recent report into mental illness. But we have heard nothing from Mr Howe. The silence is deafening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no response to what is happening to women postnatally; no response to what is happening to young people with schizophrenia; no response to what is happening to people with Alzheimer's disease; no response to what is happening to people with dementia; and no response to what is happening to the number of people who are homeless as a result of the policy of de-institutionalisation of former Labor governments. We have heard nothing from Mr Howe on that report&mdash;not a thing. It is increasingly apparent that Labor's so-called commitment to social justice is predicated on ensuring its own electoral successes rather than improving the lot of Australia's one million-plus low income households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues relating to housing that affect older Australians are somewhat different from those that affect younger Australians. The majority of older people own their own homes. Often they own them outright&mdash;free of debt. For many retired people their home is a source of significant emotional attachment and, given this government's policies, reliability. It is one asset that does not seem to change. Their shares are now being assessed as capital gains for income assessment purposes so the family home is regarded as an asset that is at least secure. For many of these retired people the family home is their first and only home. It is where they have raised their families; it is the source of many happy memories. But at the same time, a family home can become a burden in retirement. It may be too big and too costly to maintain, or inappropriately designed or located for individual health and personal care needs. As a person or a couple gets older this burden inevitably increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when our population is ageing&mdash;a fact highlighted in the EPAC report released earlier this week&mdash;our challenge is to adopt policies that facilitate the development of sufficient appropriate housing choices for older Australians. While that is a responsibility of both state and federal governments, state governments in particular should be encouraging flexibility in housing regulations so that older people have some flexibility in the way their house is used, especially over a limited period so that they could have people living with them or assisting them. But that is a matter of concern for the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister has frequently highlighted the deleterious effects of urban sprawl. In fact, from shadowing his portfolio, I think housing is his only interest. To ask him about other issues, such as aged care and disability services, one would think that he hardly knew about them. He has talked about the urban sprawl&mdash;not for one moment do I suggest that the problems that he highlights are not real&mdash;but two points need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, this government has a lot to answer for because of the recession that we had to have and the high interest rates that followed. The high interest rate policy of the then Treasurer and the now, unfortunately, Prime Minister Keating&mdash;I am sure that there are one or two people on the other side who lost out in the recent reshuffle who think it is unfortunate that Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I think you have to address the Prime Minister by his correct title. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to him as Prime Minister Keating because, unfortunately, the rules of this chamber require me to do so but I would prefer not to. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for pointing that out to me because I had made a slip. The high interest rate policies that resulted in record high mortgage rates forced young families to move out into satellite suburbs&mdash;miles from the metropolitan areas, long miles away from their families, support systems and extended families, and miles away from their work places, which involved long distances to travel&mdash;to find a house that they could afford.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it has always been my philosophy that it should be the people themselves and not the government who decide where and in what sort of accommodation they live. For many older Australians their housing choice must by necessity be far more than mere bricks and mortar. In times gone by some aged care planners referred to a continuum whereby older people moved from a home to a retirement village, supported accommodation unit or hostel and then to a nursing home and possibly finally to an acute hospital bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful whether that continuum ever existed. It is certainly true that it does not exist today and it is less likely to exist in the future. As the needs of older people increase, they may opt for an accommodation choice more appropriate to their needs. They do not necessarily move along the continuum that I described. Most often they move only once or possibly twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Noel Howard from the highly successful Illawarra Retirement Trust refers to `taking care to people' rather than `taking people to care'. This is the way of the future in terms of ensuring appropriate housing choices for older people. Not only does it maximise older people's independence and reduce the number of upheavals that they must endure, but it is also financially far more efficient for government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, if there is one part of the aged care program that is badly in need of reform, it is the home and community care program. While there has been a major increase in funding for HACC since its inception in 1985, less than half of the target population benefits from that program. In spite of this massive unmet demand, Labor has seen fit to reduce the real rate of increase in HACC funding in each of its last two budgets. We have an EPAC report that shows us that the number of older people in Australia is increasing, and yet in the last two years Labor has seen fit to decrease the real rate of HACC funding. The inevitable result of that lack of HACC funding is early admission to residential care, with an accompanying loss of independence for older people and significantly higher costs for government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the problems with HACC stem from the fact that it traverses all three tiers of government, resulting in duplication, unnecessary administrative overheads and major differences in service provision both between and within states and regions. The key to reforming HACC lies in putting Commonwealth-state relations back on the political agenda. They were taken off the agenda by Mr Keating when he was elected by his party because he believed the initiative belonged to Mr Hawke. Unfortunately, as the Queensland Premier has pointed out, the likelihood of it coming back onto the agenda is remote under the current Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most older people own their own homes, ensuring some degree of financial security in their retirement, I cannot let this opportunity pass without referring to a group that is often forgotten by government and society. I refer to older people who are either totally homeless or who live permanently in boarding houses&mdash;in particular those who live in boarding houses around the edges of some of our inner city areas. Those people are being affected by the regentrification of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his mental illness report, Burdekin points out that large numbers of Australians affected by mental illness live in boarding houses and that living conditions in many of these establishments are nothing short of disgraceful. Older people make up a large proportion of these residents. These older people often have no family&mdash;if they do have family, they have separated themselves from that family or have been separated many times because of their mental illness&mdash;friends or support base. If they were not in a boarding house, they would be on the street or on the park bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While considerable effort and money have rightly been put into solving the problems of youth homelessness, society has largely forgotten our older homeless. We must ask why. It is only the tremendous work of voluntary agencies that allows these most disadvantaged members of our society to maintain at least some basic level of dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A thought just crossed my mind while I was thinking about that. It sticks in my throat that Senator Bolkus said that we were hypocritical. Talk about hypocrisy!  On 11 December 1992 Mr Keating announced on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that he was going to match dollar for dollar moneys raised by the charities over the Christmas appeal. When the representatives of the charities went to sign the fine print, they found that it was dollar for dollar raised and spent during the Christmas period. One charity that would have got $8 million on the first understanding got $5 million when it came to look at the fine print. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did charities get last Christmas? A big fat zilch&mdash;nothing. Why? There were the same number of people unemployed and the same number of people in difficult straits. There was an increase in long-term unemployed and a development in what people keep talking about as the underclass. Agencies were telling us that more and more people were coming to them for help. What had changed? The answer is that there was not an election coming up early in 1994. That is what had changed. It is hypocritical. Senator Bolkus has the hide to stand on that side of the chamber and call us hypocritical. He should look at his own policies and his own party's behaviour before he criticises ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, those voluntary organisations go on regardless of the hypocrisy of the current government. I wonder what they think about the next Industry Commission report that is being commissioned to investigate voluntary organisations. I am interested to know how they feel about having to participate in that. I am sure that will be an interesting exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those voluntary agencies do an enormous amount of work, but is it good enough that the government leaves it just to them? If this government is really serious about social justice, it should remember that it has a responsibility not only to respond to the valid concerns of lobby groups but also to go in to bat for those who have no advocates and no political voice. They do not have people who come to Canberra and lobby for them. This hypocritical government is not concerned about them. Minister Howe does not look as though he is going to give a reply to Mr Burdekin, who pointed out that this is an area where urgent action is required, especially for older homeless people who have a psychiatric disturbance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One important feature of the report is the highlighting of the difficulty that many women and children have in gaining access to appropriate and affordable accommodation when escaping domestic violence. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women escaping domestic violence can have difficulty finding refuges and shelters that accommodate children, in particular teenage boys.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission acknowledges with some concern that the demand for emergency accommodation has currently outstripped the capacity of current programs to provide it. The report states that because there is a lack of medium to long-term public housing many women are staying in supported accommodation assistance program facilities and crisis accommodation program  facilities indefinitely. This is eroding the benefits initially achieved by the government's emergency accommodation programs in providing people who are homeless or in crisis with immediate housing assistance. Those facilities are being used by people on a longer term basis and they are not there for those people with immediate housing problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a lot of ways it is ironic that this report deals with issues such as crisis accommodation for women. I do not know whether Mrs Kelly, the new minister for women's affairs, would be particularly aware of this. She is too busy covering her back, her front, her sides and every other flank to try to cover up what she was doing dishing out $30 million without any records or any information based on oral discussions with her staff. Somehow she and her staff have lost their memories about what they have done with a couple of thousand applications. She is busy doing that while women, l suppose, will languish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifty per cent of the supported accommodation assistance program clients are women and over a third are children accompanying a parent. Many women and children are suffering as a result of the current demands being placed on the supported accommodation assistance program and crisis accommodation program facilities because of the lack of affordable medium- to long-term accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report some attention is given to the need to streamline the assessment procedures relating to the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program funding. Honourable senators will recall that the SAP program principally funds charitable organisations and community groups to provide supported accommodation for people who are homeless or in crisis. The crisis accommodation program, CAP, provides capital funding for crisis and supported accommodation housing. While both SAP and CAP are joint Commonwealth-state programs administered by state governments, the requirement for both levels of government to be involved in assessing and approving applications for funding is causing delays and is unnecessarily adding to the cost of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is that on the one hand we have HACC and on the other hand we have the SAP and the CAP programs, both of which are suffering because of problems with state-federal relations. Again this is an issue that Mr Keating dropped because it was Mr Hawke's baby. Mr Keating could not be associated with that in any way because it might have reflected on Mr Hawke's achievements, so he dropped it. Yet another problem goes unresolved because of Mr Keating's ego and his inability to deal with the fact that his predecessor might have been on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been noted that the involvement of various government departments and community groups in the provision of support and accommodation means that there has been little pressure on the public housing authorities to house people with special needs. One of the report's recommendations is that the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program should be combined and come under the control of the supported assistance accommodation program manager, with a discretion to allocate funds for capital or recurrent purposes. This recommendation is worthy of consideration. I wondered whether Senator Lees actually read the report because she concentrated just on the housing issue in that very specific and narrow sense. When we go through the report, we find that it really deals with a very broad range of issues relating to housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 129, the report outlines concerns that were expressed by homeless women interviewed by the commission. They expressed concern not only about access to refuges and shelters, but also about their ability to pay the rents demanded in private rentals for appropriate accommodation and the difficulties in accessing public housing. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other issues of concern included discrimination, the lack of information on housing for people in crisis, and the stigma attached to being a homeless woman with children.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homelessness amongst young people is exacerbated where young people, particularly young girls, are afraid to seek assistance at mixed refuges and shelters because their safety may be in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA>Some attention is also given in the report for the need to address the disparity between the amount of rent assistance received by private renters and that of public renters on similar incomes. While rent assistance is largely determined by the level of rent paid by the household, public housing rebates are calculated on the level of income the household receives. This means that the levels of assistance paid to private renters is much less than the rental rebate to public renters on similar incomes. This is another issue that could have been addressed in this budget; it is not an issue that has to be addressed between state and federal relationships. It was a very myopic approach taken by Senator Lees and Senator Bolkus. These are issues that the government can address in this budget. If the government had the will, it could address these issues. But it is obvious that the government does not have the will. It is not responding to this issue, and Mr Howe is not responding to Burdekin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission has recommended that the Commonwealth government should change rent assistance to tenants in the private rental market so that it is brought closer to rent rebates in the public housing sector. If this recommendation were to be taken up it would greatly benefit low income women, particularly those women who are sole parents. Not only would it be more equitable but it would enable many women to have greater flexibility and mobility to find employment. It would not only enable them to be located close to employment, but also enable them to be relocated close to their extended families from whom they could receive assistance. Such a measure would give low income women more control over their lives. But, as I said, I do not think this will be a primary concern of Mrs Kelly at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would love to have Mrs Kelly in this chamber and to ask her a few questions about this industry report. I think she would find it as difficult to answer these questions as she finds answering the questions on the sports rorts. My greatest sadness is that she now has the women's portfolio. While she continues to stonewall on the sports rorts affair, women's affairs will not be attended to appropriately. That area will be neglected because she will be too busy worrying about the sports rorts and saving her own skin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the government to consider this important report in its current budget deliberations. There may be state-federal issues&mdash;there should not be because the government had a draft report&mdash;that have to be addressed. But there are issues that do not have state-federal problems associated with them that can be addressed. The fact that this year's budget will be brought down earlier than in previous years is of no relevance to Australia's thousands of homeless people. They simply want a roof over their heads. If no action is taken in this year's budget, then it will be late 1995 before they, and the tens of thousands of other Australians who find themselves in inappropriate or unaffordable accommodation, receive any relief. I suppose it will be just in time for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also urge the Labor government not to continue along its apparent current path of winding back the much needed reforms to Commonwealth-state financial relations as they apply to public housing and home and community care. The irony is that we heard recently of how Mr Keating wields his power to accelerate the placing of prints in the cabinet room, yet he does not have the same will to use his power to accelerate putting people in housing. </PARA>

It just highlights a number of the issues, as Senator Patterson has pointed out, where the Democrats have missed the main game. Senator Lees threw a couple of questions that I will address. She asked whether we want to break the existing Commonwealth-state housing agreement which is already in place. Frankly, I am appalled that the Australian Democrats feel that taxpayers' money, all $1 billion per year, should not be properly accounted for in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. This is particularly so in light of the fact that if the Democrats had been doing their homework and studying what was going on, if they had addressed what the Auditor-General had previously reported to this chamber and if they had addressed the issues of last August, when this issue was before the chamber in the draft report they would well have been aware that all state ministers have been taking a close interest in this issue. The consequences that flow from the questions that were asked in the 1993 estimates should also have been before the attention of the Australian Democrats. Senator Lees acknowledged that the ministerial council was meeting later this month on this matter. I would have thought that the accountability mechanisms would have been discussed and put in place prior to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the conclusion that the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party have already reached a compromised accord on the 1994 budget. Senator Lees and the Democrats are therefore already intimidated by the commitment that they have given the government for the May budget. Senator Lees is not prepared to come in here and argue the issues that affect young Australians, elderly Australians, disabled Australians or Aboriginal Australians in the area of housing need and housing priority; she is prepared to walk away from that because a cushy deal has already been done&mdash;it has been cooked up in the corner&mdash;between the Australian Democrats and the government on this budget. The government has changed the parameters of that Commonwealth-state housing agreement, including the funding arrangements. I fail to see why the Industry Commission recommendations cannot be addressed in the time frame that is before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees also asked a question relating to the coalition's policies at the last election on the possible sale of public housing. I ask the Australian Democrats to consider very carefully what would be the consequences of selling some old public housing stock in which inappropriate people are currently enjoying the tenancies. This would release considerable capital that could be reinjected into the community for low income, needy tenants&mdash;for the 200,000 I mentioned who are sitting around on waiting lists. The government and the Democrats are just afraid that all of this will be too much like hard work before the May 1994 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees has implied that she supports the thrust of the Industry Commission's report. However, with over 200,000 people on waiting lists in this country not able to access public housing or rent assistance, I would have thought that these low income Australians in need of housing would have been the very people the Australian Democrats wanted to assist immediately. Under the government and Democrat plan, these people will have to wait until May 1995 or perhaps later&mdash;some 15 months away&mdash;for housing rental assistance as proposed by the Industry Commission report. How does Senator Lees explain that to the struggling families living throughout Australia in our cities, towns and villages?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus made a six-minute response on behalf of the government, basically attacking Liberal and National party policies and claiming they were hypocritical. He had an absolute paucity of argument. He had no informed response to the Industry Commission report that was before us. Whilst he raised the issues of the transparency and the accountability mechanisms that need to be addressed, he did not come up with any solutions. Is that not admirable? The Labor government hands over $1 billion of taxpayers' money to the states with insufficient accountability mechanisms in place and really does not care at all whether the money is spent on housing for Australians who need housing. How ridiculous!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look very carefully, in light of what has been put forward, at the issues that later this month are to be presented by this government to the state housing ministers. These issues were raised by the Auditor-General last year. I note that it now looks as though two financial years will pass before the accountability in the housing program will be addressed&mdash;and this by a federal Labor government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister had the absolute gall to speak about Labor's grant in the public housing area. He gloated over the fact that over 10 years of Labor government public housing expenditure had doubled from $500 million to $1 billion per annum. What he neglected to tell the Senate was that in 10 years of Labor government the housing waiting list doubled. That is right&mdash;it doubled. Let me give honourable senators the figures. In 1983 when the Labor government came to office there were 125,570 people on that waiting list. In 1992 the figure was 216,339&mdash;and the Labor Party and Senator Bolkus call that social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus had the hypocrisy to say that the Liberal and National parties failed young people. I would ask him to consider that young people today are the first home buyers of tomorrow. I proudly stand here and say that I want as many people as possible to take up their first home buying options, whether through the right to use superannuation funds or whether through the right to use other financial issues that we put forward. I want disabled people and Aboriginal people to have the right to decent housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the response to this Industry Commission report, the only issue that the Labor government has addressed is the Industry Commission's recommendations with regard to funding of Aboriginal housing, which it has knocked back. It put them to one side. It said, `This is the issue that we will make a decision on. We are not going to do anything; we are going to leave the present system in place'. Yet, it has told everyone else in the community, `You must wait until 1995'. I urge the Senate to support the motion. </PARA>

They ought to be of a nature which is supported by the whole of this nation because national symbols are part of a nation's character, heritage and pride.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded of the importance of those basic symbols of ours when I visited the provisional Parliament House with my colleague Senator Rod Kemp. I found two very stark and contrasting examples in the exhibitions currently being held there. The first of those exhibitions was of the flags of Australia. It was an excellent exhibition because it presented fully the history of the flag. It presented the options, the alternatives, for looking at the future of that great and fundamental symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second exhibition was called Landmark. That exhibition was supposed to reflect the relations between the land, its people and politics. It concentrated on three elements. It concentrated on Mabo, it concentrated on the Franklin Dam debate of a decade ago, and it also dealt with Australia's immigration. I was really very saddened to see the very biased approach to all of those issues that that exhibition took. In my own area of immigration, it had Al Grassby as the pinnacle of Australian immigration policy-making. The exhibition made no reference at all to the fact that it was the Liberal governments under Menzies that, progressively through the 1950s and 1960s, produced an enlightened immigration policy which led to the abolition of the white Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Menzies Liberal-National governments of those periods that provided an immigration program which formed the great basis for much of the development of our nation. None of that was included in that exhibition. I must say I found that not only surprising but a matter of great concern, and it ought to be of great concern to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should reasonably expect that a person of no less eminence and stature in this country than the Australian Prime Minister, the highest elected official in the country, should uphold and promote our national symbols with honour, pride, commitment and resolution. On the contrary, Mr Keating has had a go at just about every national symbol. He has undertaken a persistent, venomous and divisive attack, supported and encouraged by his left wing colleagues, various un-Australian vested interests and apologists, including, in particular, Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner, who has temporarily joined our side, and supported by a group of downright un-Australian activists and interest groups. If one is going to play with the nation's symbols and institutions, one is playing with the very core and basis of what this nation has been built on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this approach a monstrous attempt to rewrite our history, but it also sucks the confidence and vitality of our people. One of the most shameful of these assaults has been the Prime Minister's denigration of our number one national symbol, the Australian flag. He has denigrated it not just in Australia but around the world. He ignores public opinion which overwhelmingly takes pride and honour in our flag, a flag under which Australians have fought and died in order to defend that which it represents&mdash;that is, a free, federated nation under the Southern Cross, built on our rich heritage from our founding fathers from Great Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has taken that denigration around the world. He did it in Indonesia, in one of his first fleeting visits when he tried to discover Asia in his early days as Prime Minister. With regard to Mr Keating taking Australia into Asia, he is an absolute novice; he is a Johnny-come-lately. He said in Jakarta in 1992&mdash;several months after he became Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sure that in this part of the world, people do wonder about Australians representing themselves with a British flag in the corner of our flag. That must change and it should change because Australia should respect itself as a country of independent minds and spirits.</PARA>
<PARA>At about the same time&mdash;indeed, on the same tour&mdash;he said to a group of school children in Papua New Guinea who were waving the Australian flag on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Kokoda Trail, `I see you've got an Australian flag, have you? Well, I'll get you a new one soon'. I have yet to hear of any other national leader in any other country of the world who grovelled and denigrated his nation's prime national symbol in overseas visits in the way that Prime Minister Keating did on that occasion. Not only did he do that, but at an Anzac Day ceremony just two years ago, when the national president of the Australian RSL, Alf Garland, wanted to present him with a small Australian flag, he gave it back to him and said, `No good giving it to me, give it back to one of your Pommy mates'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a quote which has never been denied by this Prime Minister. It shows that the Prime Minister's motivation in terms of his attack on our institutions and our symbols is not done on the basis of wanting to assert Australia's independence. Everyone in the world, including everyone in Asia, knows that we are a totally independent nation and we have been for many decades. What it concerns is a deep-felt hatred of anything English. That is what motivates this Prime Minister in terms of our institutions, in particular the flag and in particular the republican debate. He seems to imply there is a subservience somehow or other by Australia to Britain because of those institutions and symbols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall, and I am sure my colleagues well recall, it was in the 1950s and 1960s that Mr Keating and his party were waxing long and loud on our so-called subservience to America. It had nothing to do with Britain; at that stage it was America. When he has a problem he picks a diversion and does it in a way that is deeply offensive to most Australians and, most importantly, in the longer term, is deeply damaging to the whole fabric and fibre of our society. It is a tragedy that this Prime Minister does not realise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to this area of denigration of basic institutions and symbols in Australia, of recent interest directly to my portfolio of immigration and citizenship has been the unwarranted, party-politically motivated abolition of the Australian oath of allegiance for citizenship ceremonies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in addressing the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. This particular inquiry was one of the most challenging, intense and, in a sense, harrowing inquiries that I have participated in. The inquiry received 1,031 submissions, then something of a record. However, this has now been surpassed by more than 6,000 submissions received for the inquiry which follows the family law inquiry; that is, the one that concentrates on child support and also deals with the resources available to the Family Court. The latter is an extremely important issue and I look forward to the committee tackling it at a very early opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I said `harrowing' because,  as we went through the process under your expert and tolerant guidance as the chairman of the committee, I&mdash;and, I believe, other members of the committee&mdash;realised the limits of legal action which can be taken in such an intensely personal and traumatic area, where people have been hurt and where, in their pain and frustration, they want to hurt their former partner. I say `harrowing' also because the children were likely to be the innocent victims. Everyone would support the Family Law Act, and indeed the Family Court, when the statement is made that the welfare of the child must be paramount. I believe that in all the dealings of the committee&mdash;and, I am glad to say, also in the responses from the government&mdash;this guideline has been observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that we have a responsibility to construct a legislative framework that is as good as can be achieved to deal with this highly traumatic area of personal concern. In doing so, we need to realise that prevention, education and alternative dispute resolution&mdash;alternative to the courts that is&mdash;are the areas which we must emphasise to spare the former partners and their children some of the trauma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I welcome the positive response by the government in a number of areas. In particular, I welcome its acceptance in principle of the committee's view that alternative dispute resolution and mediation processes, as well as counselling and education, should be advanced at a much greater rate. I welcome also the strong commitment to improved enforcement of Family Court decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also adopted one of the committee's recommendations in a somewhat stronger way than I believe the committee expressed it, and that is in the area of pre-nuptial agreements; it has specified a number of welcome guidelines for the way in which this matter should be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has picked up another area in a stronger way than the committee considered it, and in a very welcome way. I refer to the joint parenting concept, which should, as time goes on, supplant the concept of custody which to some extent carries the implication that the other partner is excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the government has not responded to some of the additional recommendations that I have put forward relating to facilitating self-representation, the separate legal representation of children, and the treatment of gay and lesbian partnerships in the same way as heterosexual de facto relationships are treated by the court. If this committee system is to provide the benefit to the Senate as a whole that we expect from it, I believe the time must come when the government is asked to respond to dissenting opinions when specific recommendations are made as well as to the majority recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the government response. I welcome the fact that, where the committee has recommended legal procedures and measures and the government has accepted them, the government has done so with a degree of alacrity and has in fact stated that those things will be implemented and dealt with fairly quickly. However, on the areas that I mentioned before, which in some way are central to the recommendations that the committee made&mdash;that is, mediation, counselling, education and training of counsellors to achieve the deployment of people with better qualifications&mdash;we find that the government accepts the recommendations in principle but, on no fewer than 15 occasions, then says that the matter must be considered in the light of competing budget priorities. That surely must be disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has placed on record in a very painstaking way the opinions and the evidence provided by more than a thousand submissions and by several hundred people who appeared before it. I believe it would have been appropriate for the government not only to accept in principle the committee's recommendations for changes and improvements, but also to give the committee the response that it would do its best to find the funds for those recommendations. But in only one case does it say that it will seek to provide additional funds; in all other cases the comment is extremely non-committal. This means that the coming budget consultation process will be central to these considerations. I assure the government that the Australian Democrats will very carefully watch what it does in relation to providing funds for improvements that it has acknowledged in principle to be worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add the point that in some areas&mdash;domestic violence is one of them&mdash;many of the responses that the government has made seem to indicate that it believes enough is being done already. If that is the case now, then the improvement has happened very speedily. If has not happened then the government should accept that the committee would not have reached the conclusions it has on substantial evidence. It is somewhat off-handed for the government to say it believes that this matter is already being attended to by the Family Court or by other agencies. I am somewhat disappointed by the cavalier attitude that the government takes to a number of issues and, in particular, to the issue of domestic violence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, may I mention the part that you played in getting a government response now to this very important, very emotional and very traumatic act&mdash;the Family Law Act. The people it deals with all the time are those who have concerns and problems, and who obviously have not been getting on. The situation is always full of emotion. As chairman of the committee which investigated the Family Law Act, Mr Acting Deputy President, I believe the part that you played has to receive some commendation, as does the part that Senator Spindler played in supporting my initial moves for an inquiry into this act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a long road. It took quite some time to get the inquiry started and then to get the Attorney-General to enact many of the changes that the committee recommended. No amount of legislative change will remove all of the bitterness and pain of family separation. In trying to get this inquiry going in the first instance, I sought to make the system more equitable, affordable and accessible to all. I believe the committee was able to go some way towards doing that. I thank all my colleagues who supported this inquiry. I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for the part you played as chairman of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government response. The present Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, was on that committee under your chairmanship, Mr Acting Deputy President. Although we have the government's response, I regret that it has taken a year. Maybe that has a little bit to do with elections and changes of Attorney-General. But change in the legislative process is always slow, and changes to family law appear to be particularly so, as we have seen. I am pleased that the government has picked up many of the committee's recommendations. Senator Spindler has alluded to quite a few of them and I will not repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General has called this the most far-reaching reform process in family law since the act was first introduced. When the Murphy act was first introduced it was quite dramatic and innovative, and included the change from fault to no-fault. I will not go back to that debate because it has long passed. The act has been going for quite some time and the review has brought out a few things. Mr Lavarch has said that the original concept of simplicity and affordability was never fully realised, and those of us who were on the committee would understand exactly what he means by that. He was on our committee and would well know the number of complaints we had about the cost and complexity in the whole process of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response says that it is committed to attacking excessive costs in family law as part of a concerted effort to overcome the wider problem of the financial barriers that ordinary citizens have. That is what this report is about. There are 40,000-odd divorces every year. Even though there may be only 5 per cent of that number who go to the adversarial or legal side of the act, it still applies to everyone. I am particularly pleased that there will be an effort to increase mediation and to reduce the adversarial nature of divorce. Senator Spindler has already alluded to that. Hopefully, in years to come children will not be used as pawns in bitter custody battles. Fairer access and custody procedures might well be the result of the work of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children are involved in 59 per cent of marriage break-ups. Each year in Australia the numbers are increasing as divorce rates continue to climb. For their sake it is imperative to get in place legislation that protects them and ensures their very best future. That is what the change in the act was meant to do in the first instance: children were meant to be paramount. I wonder sometimes whether in the last years they have been used only as pawns in the game. I accept the government's refusal to remove the terms custody, access and other emotional terms, but, if we alter the process by which custody and access are achieved, we will at least be removing some of the acrimony. It is impossible to remove it all. No matter how much we change the legislation there will be some who complain that we have not done enough. I believe that the act should be looked at again in a few years time. If there are many complaints and problems with it, it should be amended to make it better. That is what we are meant to do in this place. We look at bills that are put up by the government of the day&mdash;and occasionally by a private member&mdash;and they become acts after passing through this parliament. We should be making the Family Law Act good, easy to understand and financially accessible to people who divorce once they have decided they cannot live together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the assumption of equality as a starting point for property settlements. However, one of the many reasons why the inquiry commenced was to prevent the complete disintegration of the family farm in property settlements due to the adversarial nature of the act. The present system of property settlement is too discretionary and leads to too many inconsistencies and inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee heard countless examples of seemingly bizarre property settlements. While not many involved farms, there were enough to make one realise that the present law is unjust. Regretfully, the government wishes to continue this injustice. However, the response states that there does not appear to be any basis for differentiating between farming properties and other businesses, and that the Family Court should consider the desirability of preserving that business as an income producing unit. If the Family Court ensures that, in the long run, the children will benefit from the money invested, it will go a long way towards overcoming some of the difficulties that have been created by previous Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long superannuation has been a sticking point that has not been treated with any consistency or equity. I certainly agree with the government response that a new approach is needed. The government says that in the future superannuation will be treated as a discrete asset to which both parties have contributed, directly or indirectly, and from which both parties will be equitably entitled to benefit. I welcome the initiative of the government to convene a working party involving superannuation industry experts to develop a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lavarch, as the Attorney-General, sat on the committee, so this matter is now in his court. If he can do something to alleviate all the problems raised in evidence before that inquiry, he will go a long way towards making his mark as being an Attorney-General with the interests of children at heart. This report is all about ensuring that, even though divorce is adversarial in nature, the interests of the children are looked after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act while you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a former chairman of the committee, are in the chair. This evening, you may have to listen to me in utter silence, while as chairman you were able to intervene whenever you felt it appropriate to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to be a member of the joint select committee, an inquiry which took a reasonable length of time&mdash;it could not have been done in less time. The committee had what it then thought to be a fairly large number of submissions&mdash;over 1000. That number pales into insignificance when compared to the number of submissions that we have received on the inquiry that we are now undertaking on the operation and impact of the Child Support Agency. Those involved will remember that we recommended to the government that the committee continue its work in this area because of the number of people before the committee who raised access and child maintenance as significant issues. All committee members felt that it was important to present the report dealing with the other aspects of the operation of the Family Law Act and then invite the government to ask us to deal with that which had been left out of the original terms of reference, namely, the Child Support Agency. It will be some little time yet before the committee is in position to report on the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just about every case that comes before the committee involves the vexed question of child access, as it did so frequently in the previous inquiry. Indeed, the committee made some recommendations on access and about enforcing access and was very aware of the difficulties in this area. Ultimately, a court order can be enforced by putting in gaol any person who does not comply with it. That concept, in relation to child access, is very difficult to come to terms with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the committee has not found all the answers to child access, I am satisfied that the judges of the Family Court of Australia are equally aware of the problems of making access work for all the parties involved, particularly the children. However, there is still work to be done to resolve the issues. Fundamentally, the resolution of access problems in most instances comes down to working out a better relationship between the parents living apart than they obviously had while living together, and in part dealing with the grieving process which is a consequence of the marriage failure, and the hurt that goes with it. Mostly, it is the hurt that still exists on one side or the other, or with both parties, that causes access to continue as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was established in about March 1991 and the committee handed down its report of 120 recommendations in November 1992. We all would have liked to have seen the government's response to that report much earlier than we did. But I, at least, recognised the difficulty of dealing with such an extensive report when an election intervenes and a new Attorney-General is appointed and has to, in a sense, start at the beginning. The report was listed for tabling on the last sitting day last year, but it was not reached as an item of business, so we now have it before us this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can feel pleased that the government has accepted the bulk of the recommendations, although they still have to be put into effect. While less significant in many ways, one of the most important recommendations is that before too long the Family Law Act should be reprinted and consolidated so that it is easier to use. Another issue that we could talk about for some time is the complexity of the act. In its present form it has to be more costly to deal with than if it were reprinted, consolidated and made easier to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original act set out to simplify dissolution of marriage by making it more friendly and so on&mdash;we would all recall the rhetoric of 1975. Ten or 12 years ago, the act was about a centimetre thick, but now one almost needs both hands to deal with it. It is a great pity indeed that, like the Taxation Act, this sort of legislation is blossoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry there was an enormous amount of criticism of the cost of lawyers&mdash;much of it, I thought, totally unjust and unwarranted. That is not to say that there are no specific instances where costs have been grossly excessive. But it would be naive in the extreme to suggest that lawyers need not be involved in this area. With counselling and mediation, both parties should be well informed about their rights and what they are embarking upon, otherwise great injustice could follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, I cannot refer to all the issues in the report. However, I support the concept of moving towards mediation where that is likely to be effective. Another recommendation is that the concept of guardianship be retained in the act. I would have liked the committee to suggest that the word `custody' be removed from the whole area. I am pleased to see in its response that the government has formed a preliminary view that there should be a move away from, amongst other terminology, the use of the words `guardianship', `access' and `custody'. I would urge the Attorney-General to follow up that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word `custody' is an extremely negative word in this country and in our vocabulary. The word `custody' has within it the concept of being in custody. We may say that it is a superficial reaction to the problem of dealing with children, but people feel they must have custody of a child to assert their ownership of it. The same result can be achieved, but in a way that is less confrontationist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that custody of children is that which follows from the birth of a child. Those two people who were the parents should have custody&mdash;if that word is used at all&mdash;for all time. The court should make orders relating to where a child will live and how it may move between its parents, and hopefully its grandparents. I recognise that there would have to be consequential legislation dealing with things like passports, but they are mere bureaucratic details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our recommendations involved more money, more counselling, more access to interpreters et cetera. The committee has now embarked on an inquiry as to the funding of the Family Court; whether it is adequate for the things that the parliament has asked it to do, and whether it is dealing wisely with the money it has. So anybody reading the report may feel it does not have depth and detail in that respect, but at least we are looking at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big area which still is to be solved in our society is superannuation. I am not entirely happy with the government's response, but I think it flows from the fact that the government has not yet come to terms with retirement income policy in our society. Current superannuation legislation still leaves women the poorer in old age for the want of proper superannuation or a proper retirement income policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the debate when the government brings forward the legislation relating to the changes in the Family Law Act. It goes wider than just dealing with superannuation as a matter of a property settlement. But I do think the government has not quite grasped the nettle yet in relation to what it intends to do. We have dealt with so many issues, and there are more here. I hope people interested in the area will look at the report and the government's response. I hope they will maintain their interest in the topic. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a result of a reference of the Senate on 7 May 1992. That does seem a long time ago, but between the first reference by the Senate and the presentation of this report we did experience an election. Consequent upon the election, we also experienced a change in the chair of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found what common sense would expect to reveal on this matter: that there is a long history of the incidence of toxic algal blooms in Australian waterways. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that incidences of those blooms occurred before there was habitation of the Australian continent, either by Aboriginals or by any subsequent occupation. This suggests that such blooms are a natural occurrence. While that may be so, the committee learned that the occupation and exploitation of the land resource of Australia has resulted in an increased incidence of these blooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also found that there is an abundance of knowledge in fact and opinions derived from all sorts of sources as to what is the cause of these blooms. The committee found there was plenty of information but not a lot of collation or confirmation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information tends to follow the same source; that the blooms were caused either by an abundance of nutrients or reduced turbidity or flow, or an increase in the conditions which are conducive to the growth of the toxic algae. The growth may occur because the algae is not being grazed upon, or because the conditions are so overwhelmingly suitable for that particular part of the ecology that it overwhelms all others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blooms, by their very nature, tend to exhaust their nutrients and dissipate of their own accord; or they can be reduced and modified in a number of ways. The most severe way, which is being undertaken by authorities in the United States&mdash;I would say fairly typically&mdash;is the application of a few explosives, and the bloom was suitably dispersed. In other cases there is an increase in the flow in the water body; and again the bloom can be dispersed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fluxion of time allows the bloom to exhaust its nutrients and disappear of its own accord. But nutrients can also be removed either in an immediate sense by mechanical or even chemical means; or they can be removed in the long term by a change in the source of those nutrients. It is that area, the change in the source of the nutrients, which holds the greatest promise for intervention by either government bodies or private individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This knowledge is well held in the community. It is a question of coordination and, I would suggest, the will actually to conduct this removal of the source of nutrients.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee fairly early in the proceedings found that phosphorus in its various forms was a major contributor to the nutrients. I am a little disappointed that we were unable to find a strong enough recommendation virtually to direct that the sooner we remove the sources of phosphorus from our waterways the sooner we will have a long lasting reduction in the incidence of toxic blue green algal blooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I did not consider it necessary to use my initiative to create a minority report that came out with some stronger recommendations, I find some dissatisfaction in that we could not get to the stage where we recommended that action be more immediate or effective. I cannot really see any reason why we should extend. For example, recommendation 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years then legislation be enacted to reduce levels or to ban phosphates in detergents.</PARA>
<PARA>Although that does address the concern about phosphates in detergent, the committee was given evidence about examples in Canada where phosphate levels of detergents were reduced without affecting their effectiveness and where there was a considerable effect upon the incidence of toxic blue green algal blooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation, although it does address this problem, is, I would suggest, a bit limp and not quite direct enough. Even though I was a member of the committee, I do not feel at all guilty about suggesting that we could have had stronger recommendations. The evidence is there and those who read the report will probably be able to come to the conclusions themselves&mdash;the urgency and the economic advantages which would accrue to Australia in reducing the incidence of those blooms; and the economic disadvantages&mdash;the huge amount of money that is wasted in Australia&mdash;and the huge amount of social pressure that should be brought to bear upon any authority which has any sort of control at all over our waterways. That, of course, is the other problem&mdash;the problem of who does control our waterways, be they internal waterways or be they the coastal waters of Australia. It is a sad indictment of the map drawing skills of our colonial forebears who tended to ignore the biological and the natural geographic boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this committee was investigating this matter, it found that the bio-regional concept of the management of our resources transcended the artificial cartographic skills of our former boundary makers. For example, water catchment areas were seen as the most suitable way to determine the boundaries of a group of people who were trying to do something about managing their resources properly. This often involved two, three or even more municipal boundaries, parts of municipal areas and parts of cities. In some cases such bio-regional groups even transcended state boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling Basin covers several state boundaries. Any action that is undertaken in that Murray-Darling Basin to try to govern that water resource requires the cooperation of several state governments, the local governments and many other quangos and semi-government authorities. So it is difficult but not impossible, I would suggest. I would recommend that people take very careful note of this report, read it carefully, see the wealth of knowledge it contains and perhaps even see the need to be a little bit more forthright than the recommendations would have us follow. We do need to act urgently on this matter, and I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993 was before us yesterday I was discussing and putting into context arms control measures in the bill and I was talking about nuclear weapons and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I gave only a brief review and, before I leave the subject, I want to make the point that the world has entered into a new age with respect to nuclear weapons. We will see in the decade ahead a huge reduction of the nuclear arsenals and the number of nuclear weapons in the world because of the end of the Cold War. We will not see their total elimination; nevertheless, the reduction will be quite dramatic and the world will be a better and a more secure place as a consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While primarily due to the ending of the Cold War, reduction will also be due to the possibility that new weapons systems will provide some alternative to nuclear weapons in a military sense. I do not want to expand on that at this time, but the emergence of precision guided munitions launched primarily from aircraft and secondarily from missiles allows for greater precision in attacking military targets and greater safety because, unlike nuclear devices, they cause no damage to surrounding civilian infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international convention on chemical weapons reflects great credit on the years of work that this government has put into bringing this about and it has, as I said earlier, the full support of all on this side of the Senate. Chemical weapons in the broad sense are poisonous gases, solids or liquids which can be delivered in a variety of ways against human beings. They share some of the characteristics of nuclear weapons that we were talking about before, but they differ markedly in several characteristics: they are usually low cost and readily available, or their precursors are readily available, and are very easy to conceal and transport. Most of the chemical precursors used, as I said a moment ago, are very cheap. They are readily available in the normal industrial or commercial world and their presence is easily explained as having a legitimate commercial purpose. The processing factories wherein the chemical weapons are made are also relatively cheap to establish. In fact, they are very cheap when we compare their cost to the huge cost of enriching nuclear fuel to weapons grade levels, of ultracentrifuges and of the gaseous diffusion process where there is a huge capital outlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of a factory to produce chemical weapons is infinitely less and, therefore, much more attainable for nations around the world. It is very easy to conceal and deceive because, quite plausibly in many cases, one could argue that it was a normal chemical factory producing a range of chemicals. Because of all these factors they are very tempting to the less technologically developed and poorer countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a practical point of view, chemical weapons have certain inherent limitations. For example, against dispersed troops in a high wind, there is obviously some limitation to the use of gas. But the other side of the coin is that agents such as nerve gases are really quite devastating in their lethality. Nerve gases are a magnitude beyond the gases that were used in the First World War, to which I referred yesterday when I was talking about lethality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two important areas of international arms controls that now need to be addressed by international arms control measures are biological weapons and missiles. The need for control of biological weapons is self-evident, and I do not need to talk about that. But there has been little or no attention paid internationally to the ready availability and the increasingly easy way one can obtain surface-to-surface missiles. I am not necessarily talking about those at the top end of the range&mdash;the intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are extremely expensive, very difficult to transport, very difficult to conceal and the presence of which is readily detected by technical inspection means. I am talking about those missiles with a range of between 1,000 kilometres and 5,000 kilometres. They are the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as weapons systems go they are relatively cheap and affordable and they are becoming increasingly easier to obtain internationally. They provide excellent platforms, not only for the delivery of high explosives but also for chemical and biological weapons. One has only to reflect on the effect of these sorts of intermediate range ballistic missiles with biological or chemical warheads, to realise that they are a terror weapon par excellence when they are used against undefended civilian communities. As such, the possession of the missiles is a necessary target for future arms control measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The element in the bill which limits its effectiveness is the old enemy of all arms control measures&mdash;verification. That problem is common to all the arms control measures that have been put in place. How are we going to inspect and detect the presence of these weapons in another country? The bill provides comprehensive measures but, at the end of the day, governments are like individuals&mdash;they can choose to break the law or to be dishonest. When a government chooses to break the law, it has much greater powers of deception and concealment than any individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supporting the verification process in this bill is a procedure called the challenge inspections, whereby one country can request an actual on-site inspection of a facility in another country if there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been non-compliance with the treaty. In practice, this verification process may prove to have some limitations, but the intention behind it is laudable and, at the present time, the legislative procedures are about as far as they can go. Clearly, in the years ahead, the bill and the treaty itself will have to be upgraded to improve its application and effectiveness. That will come about through improvements in technology whereby verification can be strengthened and through improvements, hopefully, in international goodwill and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My criticisms of the verification process are not in any sense an attack on the bill. I do not wish to be seen to be reflecting adversely on the importance of the bill&mdash;I believe it is a very important bill&mdash;but the criticisms are merely a sanguine recognition of the difficulties inherent in any international arms control legislation. I have not dealt with the details of the bill because, frankly, there is no point in rehashing the minister's second reading speech, which covers the details of the bill in an exemplary way. This bill represents an important and a further step down the path of international arms control. In this particular case, it goes further because it provides for the elimination of one of the weapons of mass destruction. As such, it has our support on this side of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was extremely fortunate and very proud to be part of the Australian delegation at the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993. Along with former Senator Giles, I attended a conference of the Parliamentarians for Global Action. Both Senator Giles and I were invited by Senator Gareth Evans, in his role as foreign minister, to attend the official opening ceremony at the UNESCO building in Paris. It was an inspiring occasion to hear many of the world leaders espousing the cause of peace. There was a sense of realising the enormous potential in people and nations when they set themselves to work for the positive goals of disarmament and peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentarians for Global Action met for a symposium on the role of parliamentarians in the implementation of the chemical weapons convention concurrently with the signing ceremony. Members of parliaments from 20 nations discussed the responsibilities of parliaments generally to, firstly, introduce and enact legislation to facilitate on-site inspections, to prohibit violations of the convention, and to introduce appropriate sanctions; secondly, to establish a national authority to fulfil the requirements for reporting and provision of international information; thirdly, to review the trade regulations for any inconsistencies with the convention; and, finally, to appropriate funds for the new international authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the role of members of the PGA, Parliamentarians for Global Action, was to distribute amongst members model draft legislation, such as the one that had already been prepared by Australia for general guidance. As we travelled to this conference, I was proud to be taking petitions, which had been signed by almost all of the members of our Senate, which later became the model for parliamentarians throughout the world. The petitions served as a model for declarations that parliamentarians could make to assist the progress of the convention within their parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After having that wonderful opportunity, I saw how this particular convention had broken the ground in several different ways. It was described by the Secretary-General of the United Nations as `a decisive breakthrough in the history of disarmament'. When the convention opened in Paris for signatures, it was the first genuine universal disarmament treaty. It was non-discriminatory in the sense that every nation could declare itself allied with the spirit of this convention, regardless of whether it had already made or was stockpiling chemical weapons. It was thus a very wonderful time to watch representatives of nations coming up and saying, `We have never been associated with the production of chemical weapons; neither do we ever intend to be'. The overwhelming majority of nations clearly appreciated that everyone will benefit from the treaty. At the United Nations General Assembly a year earlier in 1992, a resolution had been co-sponsored by 144 nations and passed by consensus. This eventually lead to the convention being signed from 13 to 15 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three great advantages to signatory nations. Firstly, the initial multilateral disarmament convention provides for a complete verifiable ban on a whole class of weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, it provides a model of verification which can strengthen other arms control regimes, such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Thirdly, the convention will enhance trade in chemicals under a predictable, internationally agreed regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote a statement put out by Parliamentarians for  Global Action in which Australia received praise for its involvement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After more than two decades of discussion at the UN, the pace of negotiation was greatly increased as a result of initiatives taken recently by Australia and like-minded countries. In particular, in 1989 Australia mounted the highly successful Government-Industry Conference Against Chemical Weapons in Canberra in the course of which the International Chemical Industry for the first time affirmed its opposition to chemical weapons and its support for the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia was seen to take the lead, through the so-called Australia Group of countries in our region, in coordinating action taken by countries to control the export of chemicals and equipment which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Australia also worked effectively to develop a regional consensus against chemical weapons in the South Pacific and South-East Asian region. It is gratifying to note that among the 154 signatories to the convention, all of the nations in these regions were represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chemical industries involvement has been crucial to the successful completion of the convention. The task now is for the chemical industry to collaborate fully with governments and other industries to ensure effective implementation of the chemical convention requirements. The need is set for the focus, by participating nations, on the urgent legislative and institution building tasks which we will need in, at least, the initial years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Evans mentioned in his second reading speech, only four of the 154 signatories have yet ratified the convention, though many others are preparing for ratification and implementation. It is fitting, therefore, that Australia is the fifth to ratify. Australia is certainly offering assistance, a lead to other nations and encouragement towards the day when the convention will come into effect. This occurs either after 65 countries have ratified it or 13 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Margetts raised some concerns. Having expressed my support of the convention, I too would like to raise, not by casting any aspersions on the convention at all, some features that we need to look at and consider as we go on to participate in this very positive venture. The convention specifically outlines procedures for the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. No signatory is to use or to be prepared to use them and undertakes to destroy any existing stocks. It is an impressive achievement, going much further than the current status quo on nuclear weapons under the non-proliferation treaty, as was raised by my colleague earlier in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on the issues associated with the demilitarisation of chemical weapons. The effectiveness and safety of the destruction of the chemical agents and of the costs associated with their destruction pose serious consequences for the environment. The schedule of the Chemical Weapons Convention outlines that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each state shall determine how it shall destroy chemical weapons, except that the following processes may not be used: dumping in any body of water, land burial or open-pit burning. It shall destroy . . . only at . . . appropriate facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The favoured method, unfortunately, is incineration. With tens of thousands of tonnes of chemical agents to be destroyed, we are looking at a huge environmental problem, simply because the incineration process is not a closed system. Emissions escape the combustion train. Also, there are the products of incomplete combustion that disperse into the atmosphere along with the left-over contaminated ash. Worse than this, some nations do not have the funds or the facilities to appropriately deal with the harmful agents. Russia has been a case point of concern ever since the bilateral treaty on the destruction of chemical weapons with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The destruction of chemical weapons can be as bad as using the weapon itself. This was pointed out in a very personal and concerned way by one of the parliamentarian delegates from Russia who said that the concern of people in the local community about the stockpiles was so enormous that they may not be willing to have the destruction occur. The lack of proper environmental protection laws in many countries throughout the world will mirror the problems that have been mentioned in relation to Russia. It could lead to great difficulties and quite damaging consequences, not simply for the environment but for all the people living in those areas and, potentially, for the global situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States' efforts in keeping its side of the agreement has also resulted in environmentally and politically unsound practices. The US has been stockpiling chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll in the Central Pacific for some years and incinerating them, despite the protests of Greenpeace and neighbouring nations&mdash;Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. High temperature incineration of such a huge stockpile of highly toxic weapons ignores the dangers to human populations and wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are ways to avoid significant environmental consequences. It is important to distinguish between the demilitarisation of chemical weapons and the detoxification of chemical agents. This would be done by having separate timetables and procedures for them. Demilitarisation is the immediate priority, disassembling them so that they cannot be used as weapons. Detoxification, or disposal, can then take place under stringent controls monitored by the procedures either already in place or to be made available through the sharing of information amongst the member nations of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a distinction is made in practice the pressure may be to burn off the agents as quickly as possible. Again I must stress that we need to be aware of the different practices in different countries. There has been a tremendous growth in research and development in technologies for the disposal of chemical agents, especially since the development of the United States and Soviet bilateral agreement and the United States Army decision 12 years ago to prefer incineration. These technologies provide many alternatives relying on incineration, including neutralisation, electro-chemical processes and chemical reprocessing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an imperative for the international community to remove those weapons which can cause so much damage to world peace, and it is commendable to have the convention pursued with vigour and commitment by the Australian government. But while it was exciting to see so many nations sign the convention so that the world might rid itself of chemical weapons and their destabilising influence on fragile military balances, it must be noted that therein lies the only focus of the convention. As so well put in the international citizen's accord on chemical weapons disposal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chemical weapons disarmament requires a comprehensive approach which fulfils international human rights and ecological needs.</PARA>
<PARA>There was discussion at the Parliamentarians for Global Action conference regarding the need to also share the financial resources of the wealthier countries to assist those who would be in a very difficult position indeed to find not only the technologies but also the resources with which to put those technologies into place. The international pressure needs to come from nations like Australia which played such an important role in setting it up to ensure the consequences of chemical disposal do not have significant impacts on people and the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to acknowledge the role taken by Senator Gareth Evans and his staff in furthering the progress of the Chemical Weapons Convention in the international arena and in this parliament. Their efforts have brought great credit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to table a document which emanated from the conference I mentioned, Parliamentarians for Global Action. The document is called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Paris statement</EMPHASIS>, and it speaks of the role of parliamentarians in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It describes some of the recommendations of the convention. Prior to tabling this, I would like to quote one section for the benefit of colleagues in the chamber as I believe it reinforces the useful action that has been taken by Australia in the whole process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, it will come as no surprise to the Senate that the Australian Democrats strongly support the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill. The Chemical Weapons Convention which the bill gives effect to is a milestone in international affairs. It abolishes an entire class of weapons&mdash;weapons which are among the most inhumane yet invented. It establishes an international verification system which, at least on paper, sets new standards of intrusiveness and effectiveness&mdash;a fact that we applaud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we are debating this bill is due in no small part to Australian efforts and, in particular, to those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), his staff and his department. I do not want to leave anybody out, but the four people I would particularly like to mention here are John Dauth, Richard Starr, Paul O'Sullivan and Martine Letts who did a great deal of the work. I know a lot of others did a great deal of work, but I mention those four in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely acknowledged that Australia played a major role in focussing the international community on the task of bringing the ridiculously protracted talks to a fruitful conclusion. This legislation gives great satisfaction to the Australian Democrats. Throughout the 1980s we consistently argued for major disarmament measures such as this. We were accused of being naive and idealistic; we were told the world was full of despots who could not be trusted to keep their word; that disarmament would simply play into their hands. We were told that of course no country would voluntarily compromise its sovereignty to allow the kinds of intrusive verification measures which are needed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill strongly suggests that the cynics were wrong and the idealists&mdash;many of them, thank goodness, Australians, I am proud to say&mdash;were in fact realists with a bit of vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little early to declare absolute victory, though. Few countries have yet ratified the convention and the verification machinery has not been proven in practice. Nevertheless, Australia has nothing to lose by being amongst the first countries to pass the ratifying legislation. We have no chemical weapons&mdash;unless there is something the minister has not told us&mdash;and can only benefit from the impetus our ratification gives to the spread of the convention. There may be an extra burden on the Australian chemical industry, but it has played a constructive role which recognises the benefits that will ultimately flow to it. The industry deserves to be commended for this very enlightened approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Iraq should also be given a perverse sort of credit for its unwitting contribution to the convention. It was the brutal 1988 gassing of Kurds by the Iraqi air force, and the subsequent threatened use of chemical weapons against coalition forces during the Gulf War, which generated the wave of public and political opinion in favour of a global ban. Without detracting from the achievement that this bill represents, it has to be recognised that the really hard disarmament tasks are much further from completion, and some of them have not been started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Gulf War also highlighted the dangers posed by the trade in conventional arms and nuclear technology. Very little has been done, though, to curb the growth in conventional armed forces and no moves have been made towards a global nuclear weapons ban. We do not even have a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty yet, although steps have been made in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of international politics is that a ban on chemical weapons was more attractive and achievable than these other measures. But when one looks at the tragedies of Cambodia and Afghanistan, it is arguable that, for example, a global crackdown on the production and use of landmines will do a great deal more to prevent human suffering and promote economic development. The Chemical Weapons Convention, as important as it is, can be seen as only one step on a long road. The world cannot afford to rest on its laurels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990s have so far been a period of unprecedented international cooperation on security matters, of which the Chemical Weapons Convention is a prime example. However, much remains to be done before we can bask in the satisfaction that the world has been made a safer and more peaceful place. The Democrats support this bill, and we look forward to many more in the same vein. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of the Chemical Weapons Convention speaks for itself. Certainly, it has been very well explained by Senator Chamarette this evening, a little more quickly by Senator Bourne and others. There is no need for me to repeat its phenomenally important multilateral disarmament achievement&mdash;the first achievement after many years of the conference on disarmament in Geneva, and what we all hope will be a herald of further things to come that are possible in the post-Cold War era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful conclusion of the convention negotiations was a major achievement for Australian diplomacy and one of which I am very proud. It was a demonstration of the kind of effort a country of our size and comparatively limited clout can have if we put to work those resources of energy, stamina and creativity that are abundant among our own officials. I would like to add just a little to what Senator Bourne said about particular individuals within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and elsewhere who made such an important contribution to this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, some were particularly important during the latter stages of the negotiations&mdash;the so-called acceleration phase when we initiated the government-industry conference against chemical weapons and, more particularly, the last stages of the treaty negotiation with a draft of our own. The people who mattered most among the chiefs were Mike Costello, the secretary to the department; John Dauth, then the divisional head; Richard Starr, the branch head in the arms control branch; and Paul O'Sullivan, the Australian Ambassador for Disarmament to Geneva. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the indians were Martine Letts&mdash;who is now on my own staff but was then a key figure in the department&mdash;Dr John Gee, Peter Furlonger, Chris Moraitis, Patrick Cole, Ron Morris and Miriam Baxter. Robert Mathews, who received a Medal of the Order of Australia in the general division for service to the control of chemical weapons in the recent Australia Day honours list, was one of those outside the department who was a crucial contributor in that phase, as was Shirley Freeman from the Materials Research Laboratories. Before that, Dr Tim McCormack from Melbourne University was also a major contributor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the earlier stage of the negotiations&mdash;and after all, this was an exercise, as Senator Bourne said, that went for some 20 years&mdash;the key individuals who moved it along in the latter stages of that were Kim Jones, the former divisional head and, amongst the other officers, Jim Silva, Tony Taubman, Bronte Moules, Richard Butler and Richard Rowe. The last two people I mentioned are now at the Australian Permanent Mission in New York. Outside all of those frameworks, I particularly add a reference to Mr Tom Reynolds, the former President of the then Chemical Confederation of Australia who acted as chairman of the industry forum in our 1989 government-industry conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other departmental officers contributed in various ways to this exercise. It was a massive team effort. The scale and the intensity of it are very difficult to explain to outsiders, but this is probably the most complex piece of international disarmament treaty law that has ever been negotiated&mdash;not probably; in fact, it is. All our people, those that I have mentioned&mdash;I hope I have not left any of them out&mdash;played a very significant role indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not denying, as a number of speakers have drawn attention to, that there are still some tasks ahead so far as the convention is concerned, including in particular its ratification and entry into force. One hundred and fifty-four countries&mdash;a huge proportion of the UN membership&mdash;have already signed the convention. There is only a small number of actual ratifications to date. That does not reflect a lack of interest or, worse, opposition to the convention but rather the reality that it does take time to prepare for national implementation and ratification. We are only now, with the passage of this legislation, in a position ourselves to proceed to ratification, and that is a similar recurring phenomenon elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still very hopeful that 65 ratifications will be received by mid-July this year to allow entry into force at the earliest possible time, which is January 1995. We have a particular problem in the Middle East, not because of a lack of commitment by many countries there to this convention but, rather, because of the problem of linkage politically we are experiencing between that convention and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A diplomatic task for us in the period ahead is to try to break through that impasse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the problem of ensuring effective operational implementation of the treaty. We will be spending a quarter of a million dollars to establish our own CWC office. That experience has to be repeated in many other countries. Senator Hill raised some questions about the legitimacy of that order of magnitude of expenditure. I simply say to him that it is based on transferring the Australian Safeguards Office to our own department, but adding to it a layer of specialist expertise which will be necessary in order to be able to perform the really quite complex technical tasks that are involved in the verification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some questions have been asked about the likely efficacy of the verification process in the bill. I simply want to say that that was obviously the crucial and difficult issue that made the negotiations so long and difficult. I genuinely believe that we now have in the convention a workable regime&mdash;not only the best that could be negotiated, but a genuinely good regime that will be workable in practice and one which will ensure that we succeed in our objective ultimately of removing altogether from this planet the possession as well as the use of this particularly horrific brand of weapon of mass destruction. It had to be a good regime because no-one has been in any doubt about the peculiarly horrifying character of this weapon and, particularly in the light of the awful experience in the Iran-Iraq war in recent times, building on our earlier historical experience, the awful evidence of just how terrible a weapon it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say finally that I personally perhaps got emotionally as well as intellectually, politically and diplomatically involved in this whole thing as a result of my own experiences in early childhood. I am drawing in this respect on something that Senator MacGibbon said and Senator Collins said by way of interjection during this debate. I remember vividly an uncle of mine who, in my early childhood in the late 1940s, 30 years after his gassing on the Western Front, was still coughing his lungs out in the most heart-rending fashion as a result of that awful experience to which he had been exposed. He eventually died from it shortly thereafter. That is a searing experience for any kid to have. It brought home to me the awful nature of these particular weapons. I guess it is one of the factors that make me very proud indeed that we are now, with the support unanimously of this Senate, able to pass this legislation, implementing in Australia and making possible our ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I advise the Senate of new battle lines being drawn to save one of our most priceless assets, the `great Australian bush'. The ravaging of this, our heritage, is reaching new levels of absurdity in my home state of Tasmania where the Tasmanian Forestry Commission is not only permitting, but actively fostering greed-driven exploitation of our most vulnerable forests, the conditional dry sclerophyll forests. Most of us know these simply as the bush. We take them for granted, as we do our very life's breath. Virtually every Australian has at some time walked, picnicked, played or perhaps even been privileged to live in the bush. We may not all feel directly comfortable in it, but we cannot imagine a land without it. Yet it is there that we are witnessing commercial forestry at its worst, at its most devastating.

Among the first people to react to the new wave of forest slaughter have been those in and around the Reedy Marsh Forest. It is probably true that few honourable senators will have ever heard of Reedy Marsh. It is an area of unspectacular, typical Australian bush near the picturesque town of Deloraine in Tasmania's mid-north, halfway between Launceston and Devonport. It is a quiet place; nothing special by Tasmanian standards&mdash;just a few modest farms, some bush cottages and a quiet population made up of old established families and new settlers, people who have more recently opted to pursue a semi self-sufficient lifestyle in this typical Australian setting. </PARA>

It is within that area that they can now hear the chainsaws, and they, together with many others who live in and around the forest, are enraged by forest practices they are witnessing. They are so enraged that they have formed the Reedy Marsh Forest Conservation Group which has quickly marshalled considerable local and other support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met with some members of the group, and at their suggestion, and accompanied by the group's co-convenor, Mr Andrew Ricketts and Ms Suzi Mannigan, of the Tasmanian Conversation Trust, I have inspected ravaged dry forests from the air and also at ground level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To visit coupe 469A at Parrot Creek, in the Reedy Marsh Forest, is like a flashback to the devastation that we only ever see in times of world wars. But the magnitude of the tragedy is only appreciated when one realises that in the next few years seven more coupes of equal size are scheduled to adjoin that devastated area and that such devastation may be repeated again and again, even throughout this one forest&mdash;the one in which many members of the Reedy Marsh Forest Conservation Group actually live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still is that this is occurring simultaneously in more than 30 other locations just in Tasmania, and it may be repeated in each one of those areas again and again. These are among our most vulnerable and slowest growing forests, but they harbour a most diverse range of flora and fauna. By the Forestry Commission's own estimates it will take as long as 150 years&mdash;that is six generations of humanity&mdash;for those areas to grow back, if ever. There is no way of knowing what the area will look like when that regrowth occurs. The reality is that they are irreplaceable and that under such a regime of exploitation the face of Tasmania will be utterly transformed by just the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Paul McLean put it to me, were he to stand with his grandchildren upon a mound of the clearfell rubble in Parrot Creek coupe not far from his home and look out upon a sea of devastation, they would find no joy in the Forestry Commission's assurance that if these youngsters returned in 50 years with their grandchildren, they would be able to promise them that when they in turn returned with their grandchildren&mdash;100 years or more from now&mdash;they could be confident that by the end of the lifetime of those youngsters the forest might have grown back again. I am sure none of us would be reassured by that prospect. We must all be enraged alongside the members of the Reedy Marsh Forest Conservation Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, the battle has begun to save, firstly, the remaining dry forests of Tasmania and then those of our whole continent. The Reedy Marsh Forest Conservation Group has been formed to initiate and sustain the dry forest campaign which will save our Australian bush for all future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons that I will now outline, this new and vigorous group, co-founded by Paul McLean with his neighbour, Andrew Ricketts, must have our whole-hearted support and that of the federal government. They have advised the Tasmanian Minister for Forests, Premier Ray Groom, that the battle lines are drawn and that the group and many other similar groups soon to be formed across Tasmania both challenge and reject current forestry practices which are threatening to destroy those vital forest ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Informed and thinking Australians will find their arguments irrefutable, and they are these: firstly, the logging of dry forests of Reedy Marsh and other similar areas is not essential to the saw log industry; secondly, sensible and viable alternatives are currently available to the destructive clearance of our natural forests; thirdly, that woodchipping of these forests does not provide a satisfactory financial return, but paper fibre extraction from alternatives such as kanaf, hemp, grain crop stubble, with a little technological development, offer huge opportunities for the diversification and expansion of agriculture across Australia; fourthly, intrinsic conservation values greatly outweigh the wood production value to Tasmania and to the nation, and priceless and irreplaceable natural forest products are being destroyed for little benefit to Australia; and, fifthly, that a process urgently needs to be established to ensure that Tasmania honours its part of Australia's international obligations. Such a process must: maintain bio diversity; conserve all forest resources and values, including soil and geomorphology; completely identify and protect vulnerable, rare and endangered species; reserve relic vegetation and other known isolated plant communities; fully identify what is there; substantially increase the areas of contiguous protected forested land; and fully buffer all reserves from dangerous forestry operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to extend this debate in the Senate tonight, but I wish to advise that there are many more aspects to this issue that I will bring to the attention of this chamber. This is the opening salvo of the battle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sad to hear Senator Bell raise here in this chamber a matter which is really a state issue, the assumption being that all wisdom resides here in the centre of political life in Australia. To actually suggest that we should take interest in compartment X or compartment Y here or there in a particular part of Australia&mdash;that the Commonwealth government has a right to consider and should know all the details of that&mdash;I find absolutely unbelievable. The fact is that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has been a very good manager of forests in Tasmania and, in the Australian and world context, has been an excellent manager.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Resource Assessment Commission in its report last year quite clearly showed that the native forests of Australia are being managed by the various state governments, through their forestry commissions or equivalent departments, on a sustained yield basis; that the accusation by the Green movement, including the Democrats, that the native forests of Australia are being desecrated is just not true; and that the losses of forest values in Australia are due to the fact that we as a community cleared a lot of the forests for the agricultural community. Since that time there has been no substantial loss of forest. In fact, the native forests of Australia have been well managed by state governments, which own about two-thirds of the native forests, and by the private individuals who own the other third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the Commonwealth government should get concerned about particular little areas, such as this one of Reedy Marsh out the back of Deloraine, is absolute nonsense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to put on record that what Senator Bell has been saying tonight is quite misleading to the Senate and to the Australian community and that the fact is that the forests of Tasmania have been and are being well managed. Over the last 10 years about a third of the forests of Tasmania have been locked up in parks of one sort or another, with the largest grab emanating from the Commonwealth government's decision, after the Helsham inquiry, to go to World Heritage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators know, the Commonwealth government decision went against the</PARA>
<PARA>recommendations of that inquiry, but that was basically a political decision, and that has been taken. Given that, the green movement, the Democrats and the conservation movement&mdash;the anti-development movement&mdash;will never be satisfied. Their objective is to take all commercial work out of all native forests in Australia. They will keep moving and agitating to that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, the forest industry of Australia is about 60 per cent dependent on the native forests of Australia. To take the broad ecological view of being consistent with the long-term ecological sustainable yield out of those forests, it is a good thing that they are being managed for multiple use, that is, for wood production as well as conservation, water and other values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a long history and background in forestry in Victoria and, in the last 20 years, in Tasmania.
