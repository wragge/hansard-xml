It became clear from the evidence received that the committee had been given a very large and very important task. The committee began considering the written submissions at the end of last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Crime Authority and James McCartney Anderson</EMPHASIS>, and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This reference was given to the committee in the last parliament and presents an opportunity to remind senators and the public in general of the consequences of taking on any particular reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reference was, in contrast to any other reference that this committee has had, quite an expensive one. The committee sought extra funding from the Department of the Senate so that it could have legal counsel advising it. That is no surprise, given the type of investigation that it was taking on. That legal advice, as I understand it, cost over $20,000: $20,000 of taxpayers' money was provided to assist a committee. One might say that in the sum of a lot of things $20,000 is not that much. I happen to think it is quite a lot. Witness expenses, I understand, went well over $10,000. So before we even add on the cost of senators going from one place to another, this inquiry has cost $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry relates to the authority's relationship with James McCartney Anderson, who was alleged to be a criminal and was used by the authority as an informant. The cost of that exercise is not calculated in this report, but it is fair to say that the report is critical of the arrangement that the authority entered into with Anderson as an informant. The consequences of doing that in terms of cost are quite obvious in the sense of relying on him as a reliable witness and then prosecutions possibly not being able to proceed because of that unreliability. Consequently, it is worth drawing this report to the attention of honourable senators who are interested in law enforcement in any way because it highlights the manner in which the authority was dealing with Anderson at the time. It points out that the authority would no longer deal with someone such as Anderson on the basis that it then did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask, `Why did you spend all the money and have this inquiry if you had an undertaking from the authority that it would not happen again?'. The reason is that the people who are on the authority now may not be there in two or three years time. In fact, law enforcement arrangements for the Commonwealth may well be very substantially changed as a consequence of the current review of Commonwealth law enforcement procedures and the authority itself may not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report really should be taken by people in the future not just as a report on the authority and its relationship with James McCartney Anderson but also as a highlighter to all law enforcement agencies as to the way they should deal with informants and the care that they ought to take. The consequences, when the incorrect path is chosen, can be very expensive for the community as a whole, in terms of law enforcement success or otherwise, and for a parliament which undertakes an inquiry into it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This latest report of the rural and regional affairs committee provides a useful reference tool to an industry that, in recent times, has been beset by many difficulties. The wool industry today is recovering from crisis. Wool prices in the last few years have been at record lows. An industry that once employed hundreds of thousands of people and just about guaranteed year-round work is on its knees. The work and the money to pay the workers are not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national sheep flock has fallen from 170 million in 1990 to 138 million last year&mdash;that is a 32 million drop in  just three years. That alone would have been sufficient to cause large scale loss of jobs. However, low prices have forced many farmers to do their own shearing. Wives and children have become the classers, the shedhands and the rouseabouts. The reference for this inquiry has, as its basis, the recent difficulties faced by the wool industry. But the underlying resentment and the accusations go back many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry in Australia is one of the oldest, if not the oldest. It is steeped in history and tradition. Its shearing shed protocol is as exact and entrenched as many of our parliamentary procedures, although our procedures have been changed a little in the last while. Over time, strong union ties developed within the wool industry to ensure that shearers throughout Australia were employed on roughly equal conditions, notwithstanding the variation in sheds&mdash;their location and variation in employer attitudes to shearers&mdash;and also the type and style of sheep to be shorn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times change has come to the shearing industry, and to many the change has been unacceptable. The introduction of wide combs, largely by New Zealand shearers, some years ago caused unprecedented violence in the sheds. People were attacked, sheds were burnt and a lot of animosity was generated through the industry. There has always been a `them and us' attitude prevalent in the wool industry because the richest and the most powerful people in Australia's early history were woolgrowers. That is no longer necessarily the case; but the old attitude still prevails in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took evidence all around Australia. It is fair to say that we were prepared to accept the evidence as presented and then to make a value judgment. Of course, a lot of the evidence was anecdotal. I am afraid that that evidence was not taken as pure, proper evidence because there were so many times we heard people telling us that this was happening or this was supposed to be happening. During our hearings the `them and us' resentment was evident in many witnesses. One witness summed it up thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ten years ago the Australian shearers dictated the terms, to a fair extent . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian shearers today are just pleased to go to work to earn a few dollars for their family and themselves. The boot is on the other foot. Now the graziers are dictating terms to the Australian shearers and to New Zealand shearers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it was. There have been no other rural industries so adversely affected by the recession and by inappropriate policy decisions of this Labor government than the wool industry. That is no light claim. All rural industries have suffered to an enormous extent in recent years, but quite literally the bottom has fallen out of the wool industry and times are very tough. That has resulted in widespread unemployment within the shearing industry which has led to widespread discontent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions and individuals have searched for a reason, and New Zealanders seem to be an appropriate target. In 1992 shearers demonstrated outside Parliament House claiming that over 50 per cent of Australian shearers were out of work because, they said, of an influx of New Zealanders. They suggested it was made possible by the Australian government's unregulated, open-access policy on trans-Tasman travel. They also suggested that New Zealand shearers undercut Australian work rates and could afford to do so because of the favourable taxation arrangements. Calls were made for the government to apply the same work test and visa requirements for New Zealanders as apply to other visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis the committee determined to examine those claims, and it did so through a number of public hearings. As I said, there was much anecdotal evidence presented by individuals and by the Australian Workers Union. In particular, the Australian Workers Union anecdotal evidence did not stand up when it was closely scrutinised by the Taxation Office and other government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures and statistics were bandied about; about 42 per cent seemed to be a popular figure. It was claimed that 42 per cent of the shearing work force were New Zealanders; that 42 per cent of the national flock is shorn by New Zealanders; that 42 per cent of Western Australian sheep are shorn by New Zealanders; and that 42 per cent of Victorian sheep are shorn by New Zealanders. There were claims that prior to 1982-83 two to three per cent of shearers in Australia were New Zealanders, but since 1983 the figure had jumped to 42 per cent. These figures just did not stand up.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also took evidence from the Bureau of Statistics and from farmers organisations across a wide cross-section of the rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes that there is little basis for any of the claims made by unions and by many shearers. High unemployment levels are more a result of the state of the industry than any New Zealand invasion. It is certainly true that New Zealand shearers work in Australia. It is also true that many of them are very good and that some woolgrowers prefer them to Australian shearers, and that is their choice. Many of those shearers are New Zealanders who live here in Australia; we saw many of them in the different places around Australia that we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence indicated that as far as taxation was concerned, for example, the double taxation agreements&mdash;particularly those applying to visiting New Zealand shearers as was claimed by the AWU&mdash;were completely misinterpreted by the AWU. The committee's review of the evidence made it clear that it was only in exceptional circumstances that the income tax of a New Zealand shearer working in Australia would not be subject to tax in Australia. Also, the claims that New Zealand shearers were receiving the dole were unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusions in the report clearly show that there are problems in the industry that need to be addressed. The problems will not be solved by a `them and us' approach; there has to be a much better approach from the shearers and from graziers to make sure that in the future they get along well together within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would like to thank the committee secretariat for its continuing patience with those of us on the committee. I believe the secretariat does a fantastic job in making sure that we get these reports out quickly. It is a committee that gets its reports out quickly, and it has its inquiries in a succinct manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a valuable report which does little more, to my mind, than confirm what many of us suspected at the beginning of the inquiry, but it provides useful reference material to overcome future allegations. The shearing industry needs to assess this report carefully and plan better for its future. It needs to make sure that the standard of our wool preparation and the training of our shearers here in Australia is actually better than it is in New Zealand. Australia cannot afford to live in isolation, and living with New Zealand and other countries with whom we share work relationships needs to be accommodated. I commend the report to the Senate. I know the chairman will be speaking on this report later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to comment on this report. I say, as a member of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, that it is one of the reports which our committee has produced which I am rather pleased with. The genesis of it goes back to 1992. Those of us who were here will remember that we had a demonstration by shearers outside Parliament House. At the same time, the Australian Workers Union made pleas on behalf of its members for the government to do something about what it saw as an invasion of New Zealand shearers into the industry here, thus putting a lot of Australian shearers out of work. As Senator Brownhill said, we had a severe recession and drought, and there is no doubt that a lot of shearers were out of work. Someone had to be blamed, so the so-called influx of New Zealand shearers got the blame. I am pleased that this report has been put together in a factual manner, and we have been able to put to bed a lot of the claims that have been made, quite wrongly, over many years, about shearers, particularly New Zealand shearers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one doubts the ability of Australian shearers. There is no doubt they are still the best shearers in the world, particularly in regard to fine-wool sheep. Even though New Zealand shearers have come here to work, they have fitted in very well. It was revealed in evidence that the major reason why New Zealand shearers were more favoured in some areas is that they were not part of the `them and us' mentality that has evolved over at least 100 years in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, it should be remembered shearing has not changed in the way that a lot of other industries have changed. It is still very hard work. For instance, a normal shearer who shears his 200 sheep a day drags about 12 tonnes in weight across the board every day. Physiologists estimate the maximum amount of energy that a person should expend in a day is 4,900 kilocalories. In fact, Australian shearers expend well over 5,000 kilocalories every day. Obviously, they have to be very fit. Nothing has really changed except we have gone from hand shears to electric shearing to wide comb. That sums up the modernisation of the wool industry since the 1800s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We travelled far and wide in this particular inquiry. I note that the chairman of the committee is present. He was with us when we visited Barcaldine. The shearing industry and the Labor Party go back a long way, and it is rumoured that Barcaldine is where the Labor Party has its roots because of the shearers strike which occurred there in the 1800s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Brownhill has said, a lot of misinformation and exaggerated claims were made prior to this report. In fact, the AWU in Victoria initially alleged there were between 7,000 and 10,000 New Zealand shearers working in Australia. Upon investigation, it was found there were only 8,600 sheep shearers in Australia all up, and of those, 6.3 per cent, or 547, were born in New Zealand. So, to say that the claims were exaggerated is being kind. They were totally untrue, as this report found out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went on to ask for more information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and found that, if we take into account the shedhands as well, the total number of people working in the shearing industry in Australia was 11,500. On census night, 763 of those were born in New Zealand. Might I say, we have received evidence and saw for ourselves that a lot of these 763 are actually, to all intents and purposes, now Australian citizens. A lot of them have lived here for 10 years at least. Particularly in the Muttaburra area and areas up in north-west Queensland, those shearers are a very important part of the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was gratifying to all of us to see the way that the New Zealand-born shearers have moved in and become an important part of the local community. They seem to have a great rapport with the local graziers in the area. I think it is a shame that the `them and us' attitude that has built up over such a long time is taking a little longer to break down. That is the advantage for the New Zealand shearers. They have been able to come in, see things and play things as they are, and therefore have not had the `them and us' attitude hanging over their heads. That was one of the major concerns that the AWU and the shearers had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern was the industrial relations side of things. One of the concerns put to us was that the New Zealanders did not observe award conditions and that was why they were being employed. We took a lot of evidence on this from union representatives and the industry. We found that there are employers, contractors and shearing workers, including New Zealanders, who do breach award conditions, but we came to the conclusion, based on fact, that there was no evidence that New Zealand shearers actually breached award conditions any more than did Australian shearers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a misconception that New Zealand shearers who came here, worked and left the country again were actually ripping off our taxation system. In fact, some claims were made to the committee that New Zealanders visiting here for less than six months received a 100 per cent refund on all the income tax they paid, and a lot of other wild claims were made. However, when we investigated this claim the Australian Taxation Office indicated that the tax evasion is not as widespread as the anecdotal evidence suggests and that, where it did occur, it was practised just as much by Australian shearers as by New Zealand shearers. The double taxation agreement came into effect in only very exceptional circumstances in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a bit of criticism about the trans-Tasman and CER arrangements between Australia and New Zealand and our investigation into that subject took up a fair amount of our time. I was rather impressed by the evidence given to us by Mr Ted Woodfield, the New Zealand High Commissioner, who stated that the trans-Tasman travel arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . go to the heart of the special relationship between the two countries which is the product of our shared heritage, geographical proximity and adherence to common values of law, justice, democracy and economic welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>On looking at the figures we can see that in 1991, for instance, Australian goods exported to New Zealand amounted to $2.674 billion and New Zealand goods exported to Australia, $2.268 billion. In other words, Australia had a $400 million surplus in trading with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made some recommendations, as one would expect. The major one of course was that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) urgently establish a shearing industry task force to restructure the federal pastoral industry award, which we believe is way out of date; to push compliance in relation to award pay and conditions; and to develop compliance activities in relation to taxation and superannuation. We believe that the shearers are certainly not getting the benefit of superannuation that they should. Most of it seems to be taken up by the different life insurance company and administration charges. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 September 1992 the Senate referred to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for inquiry and report the employment of visitors to Australia in the shearing industry with particular reference to: (a) social and economic implications for rural communities; (b) taxation arrangements; (c) immigration regulations; (d) international agreements; and (e) industrial relations. The inquiry arose out of concern about the presence of New Zealand shearers in Australia and their effect on job opportunities in the Australian shearing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was of particular concern to the Australian Workers Union, which represents shearing industry workers. The union maintained that over 50 per cent of Australian shearers were out of work because of an influx of New Zealanders, made possible by the Australian government's unregulated, open access policy on trans-Tasman travel. It was further alleged that New Zealand shearers are able to undercut award rates for shearing because of advantages conferred on them by taxation arrangements and the exchange rate. The union and others in the industry called on the government to amend the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangements by implementing a system of work permits for New Zealanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of this inquiry, I emphasised&mdash;through an interview with the New Zealand press and also in a number of radio interviews&mdash;that this was in no way an exercise in Kiwi bashing, that it was only on the basis of sound evidence that the committee could finalise a factual report and make informed and fair recommendations to the parliament. The committee undertook an extensive program of hearings in several states in an endeavour to gather evidence from all sectors of the shearing industry. Notably, the committee held hearings in the woolgrowing districts of western Victoria and central Queensland at which witnesses from all sides of the debate gave evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that the nature of the shearing industry makes it difficult for individual witnesses to gather and present first-hand, factual or statistical information. Nevertheless, the committee was somewhat disappointed that so much of the evidence received in this inquiry, including some of the evidence from the union, amounted to anecdotes and hearsay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator would just be quiet, he will learn something. In spite of the difficulties imposed by the nature of the industry and the quality of the evidence, the committee was able to reach conclusions in relation to the major areas of concern in this matter, particularly the number of New Zealanders in the industry, taxation arrangements applying to New Zealand shearers and industrial relations. On the basis of these findings, the committee then addressed the need to alter Australia's bilateral relationship with New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the number of New Zealanders participating in the Australian shearing industry, the committee was told that there has been a significant influx of New Zealanders. A figure of 42 per cent has gained widespread currency in the industry, referring either to the percentage of the shearing work force who are New Zealanders or the percentage of the flock shorn by New Zealanders. It has been suggested that between 7,000 and 10,000 New Zealanders may be working in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee tested these assertions and has accepted the advice of the Australian Bureau of Statistics that New Zealanders comprise 6.6 per cent of the shearing work force. This evidence is derived from the bureau's 1991 census, showing 763 New Zealand-born shearers and shedhands present in Australia on census night. This was the most recent information available to the committee. The committee also found that the social and economic profile of New Zealand shearers in Australia is more complex than the simple picture of a transient population that was presented by several witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to taxation, the committee was told that the Australian taxation system, and in particular the double taxation agreement with New Zealand, conferred unfair benefits on New Zealanders working in the shearing industry. It was commonly asserted that New Zealanders either pay no tax, or get all their tax instalments refunded when they return to New Zealand. But evidence from the Australian Taxation Office makes it clear that only in exceptional circumstances will the income of a New Zealand shearer working in Australia not be subject to tax in Australia. It was apparent from the evidence presented during the inquiry that the AWU and others have misinterpreted taxation provisions relating to the double taxation agreement and the taxation arrangements applying to visiting New Zealand shearers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the evidence to the inquiry concerned industrial relations. In this area in particular, anecdotal evidence was rife, with sweeping assertions frequently made about the work practices and attitudes of New Zealanders in the shearing industry. It was commonly asserted that New Zealanders do not observe award conditions and work for under award pay. The committee also heard that the number of New Zealanders in the industry has caused a glut of labour, leading to a general decline in observance of the awards. The committee is not convinced that the incidence of award breaches amongst New Zealanders is higher than amongst Australians, or that the presence of New Zealanders is the sole cause of a breakdown in award conditions in the industry. The committee was forced to that view because of the lack of solid evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conclusion is based on the committee's review of numerous statements and documents presented during the inquiry, as well as the findings of compliance activity undertaken by the Department of Industrial Relations. I would be somewhat remiss if I did not say to honourable senators that the department admits it is not an easy matter to run down breaches and problems because there can well be cooperation between the two parties to have people either work for under award wages or accept less than award conditions. However, there was no proof that could be tendered in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final chapter of the report, the committee addresses the calls for Australia to change the trans-Tasman travel arrangements that allow visa-free travel between Australia and New Zealand. That is quite different and is a much older practice than CER. Each stands on its own, even though in both countries one may have some influence in terms of attitude towards the other. The committee is not convinced that existing migration and travel arrangements with New Zealanders should be changed. The committee notes the views of the relevant government departments that imposing a visa regime on New Zealanders would be out of all proportion to the perceived problem and would not necessarily address concerns within the shearing industry, particularly in terms of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that there are problems in the shearing industry. It is convinced that these problems must be addressed by those within the industry and that the `them and us' mentality so obvious during the inquiry must be discarded. As a person who has had a long involvement in industrial matters, I would encourage the relevant parties to give priority to award restructuring. I understand that process is beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends the establishment of forums for consultation between the Australian Workers Union, the Shearing Contractors Association of Australia, the National Farmers Federation and other farmer organisations, and relevant Commonwealth and state government departments. These forums should develop strategies and co-ordinate programs for restructuring the federal pastoral industry award, and upgrading compliance activities in relation to award pay and conditions, taxation and superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not make this recommendation on the basis of an attitude of isolation, because if we look at some of the developments in industry throughout Australia&mdash;more recently in the news was the waterfront industry&mdash;there have been quite significant changes in work practices and the attitude to management. These have been beneficial to both sides in the short term, at any rate. We will have to see how they work out in the long term and in the interests of a nation. I am not suggesting that people do this in isolation but, rather, that they be part of the move towards change with mutual benefits to all and, at the same time, protecting the interests of employer and employee organisations. This will have to be done with the understanding that nobody will get everything that they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the committee also addresses the important issues of training and certification of shearer and shedhand skills. It is mentioned in the report, and it was brought home to us, that the training of shedhands in New Zealand is far superior to what is almost an absence of training of shedhands in Australia. The committee believes that, as in other industries where proper training is in place to provide a work force that is both competent and conscious of quality control and guaranteed quality, there is a necessity for people to be properly trained which will benefit this industry. Already comments have been made by producers in the industry, both publicly and privately, of their concern about quality and the need to lift their game so that their product is more desirable in the market place. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of New Zealand shearers was absolutely fundamental to this inquiry by the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs into the employment of visitors to Australia in the shearing industry. Clearly, many of the claims made in the first instance were exaggerated&mdash;even some of those originating with the Australian Workers Union. However, that does not negate the claims altogether and pages 82 to 87 record a number of breaches which are too significant to ignore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, as noted on page 90, there was strong resistance by a number of people to the notion that New Zealand shearers caused the breakdown in award conditions. Yet, at the same time, other evidence was given that New Zealand shearers were present in sufficient numbers to cause a change in work attitudes amongst Australian shearers. I draw the attention of the Senate particularly to pages 17, 35 and 36. Although on the one hand New Zealand shearers were regarded as almost not being present, on the other hand, in some instances, almost the same people&mdash;certainly people from the same side of the industry&mdash;were prepared to say that New Zealand shearers were able to effect beneficial changes in attitudes amongst Australian shearers. So one cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pages 39 and 40 deal with the social implications for rural communities. I underline the comment there about the significant impact of the rural recession on rural towns, communities and families. Clearly, the recession is a serious factor in the loss of employment for shearing families. In a recession it is very easy to look for scapegoats&mdash;I guess we all do that&mdash;and certainly there was some of that in some of the claims which were made. Even if the shearing work force represented by New Zealanders is only six per cent, that is still six per cent of jobs which would not be available to Australian shearers. Whether or not New Zealand shearers should be present is another debate for another time. Certainly, the committee was of the opinion that there should be no change in the present arrangements which allow New Zealand workers to come to Australia. Nevertheless, it is easy to see how in times of social stress people do look for scapegoats, and so the claims are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another critical question for debate at another time is whether shearers or other employees should accept reduced pay and working conditions to help employers mitigate the effects of reduced returns, particularly in the wool industry. Of course, I do not think they should. However, one of the inferences in the debate was that somehow or other when there is a downturn in the industry the employees should help pay for that downturn. I do not accept that argument; but it is part of the background to the whole debate and it needs to be addressed. It is an issue that is part of the debate and yet does not necessarily surface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference is made on pages 116 and 117 to a number of breaches of superannuation obligations. In my conversations with a number of shearers it was pointed out to me that whenever they pressed their claims to try to achieve compliance they were unable to obtain further work and, hence, did not insist on their rights in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the committee has drawn the attention of the Select Committee on Superannuation to this matter. It is part of the whole problem itinerant workers have in accessing government policy in terms of superannuation, particularly the superannuation guarantee levy. The superannuation industry obviously is not designed to take account of the special needs of itinerant workers. I simply wanted to underline that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a number of shearers were disenchanted with the way the issue was handled by the Australian Workers Union, but I am of the opinion that the AWU certainly has been chastened in that regard. I hope that the negotiations which are suggested in the conclusions in our report certainly will operate at a much better level in representing the needs of the shearers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusions to the report are recorded on pages 134 and 135, and I think they are going to help this industry to overcome 100 years of history&mdash;certainly if they are taken seriously by the industry, the unions involved and the various government bodies. Then I believe we can begin to address a very deep division within our community that ought not to be there. I believe that our rural communities need both the shearers and the wool industry to work together to achieve the kinds of results that we all want so that this industry will continue to play an important part in the support of Australian families and communities, and of course the Australian economy. </PARA>

I think they reached 206 million at the higher stage. That is why more shearers were needed. New Zealand shearers saw the opportunity and came to Australia. The figures show that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there was also the highjacking of Australian woolgrowers by the shearers because of the shortage of shearers compared with the number of sheep. In some cases in high season shearers were demanding twice the award rate. Of course they had to be paid. Some of the time the farmers may have been able to afford those wages with the high wool prices; but the wool prices did not last. So that was the reason there was the opportunity for Kiwi shearers to come to Australia. There is the myth around that New Zealand shearers undercut the award rates. Senator Burns's committee did not find any evidence whatsoever of that. I always knew that that was not going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I employ a shearing team of 20 shearers. I know that they will not shear for under the award, but the difference is&mdash;and Senator Burns cannot get it through his thick skull&mdash;that Kiwis are prepared to shear for the award. That was the difference at the time between the Australian shearer and the Kiwi shearer. The Kiwi shearers for the most part are prepared to shear for the award. That is the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another myth that has been around is that New Zealand contractors employ only New Zealand shearers. That is totally false. Senator Burns's committee did not find otherwise. A Kiwi contractor will employ the best shearers and the best shedhands he can get at the time. I know that from experience. That is what they do. Another thing, too, which shoots Senator Burns's argument out of the water is that there are very few New Zealand-born wool classers around. So generally the wool classer who comes with a shearing team is an Australian. If Senator Burns is saying they are all New Zealanders he is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kiwi contractors also introduced women on the board in the shearing work force. Senator Burns should know, because he has been around as long as I have, that there was a time when women were not allowed in the shearing shed. Can Senator Burns remember that?</PARA>

I have seen an odd woman shearer&mdash;not too many. The women are better on the shearing floor. I know that from the experience of seeing how they work. Even Australian women who work there tend to be better than some of the useless board boys that cannot even be woken up in the morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

As for Kiwi shearers coming and going and just taking their profits home, that is wrong. The committee found that out. Kiwi shearers are permanent residents of Australia. We had one Australian contractor for 23 years&mdash;that shows how hard we are to work with&mdash;and when he retired along came a Kiwi contractor and we have had him for about seven years. So I know both sides of the story. I know they are permanent Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do Senator Burns, Senator McKiernan or anyone else have any figures which show how many Australian shearers are working in New Zealand? I do not think they do. I know there are a lot of Australian shearers working in New Zealand. In fact, there are Australian shearers working in the United States on a regular basis. They go there for two months and then come back. They are teaching that industry what to do. In most parts of America they still tie up a sheep to shear it. That shows how far behind they are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the previous speaker, I will dwell on the report before the parliament today on the employment of visitors in the Australian shearing industry. I commend the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and, in particular, its chairman for bringing this report into the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a vexed question around this place a couple of years ago when we had large numbers of Australian workers demonstrating to protect, as they thought, their employment prospects in this country. The report suggests now that they were perhaps misguided and misinformed about the reasons why they had to camp out on the grounds of this building in freezing temperatures night after night. One could not but marvel at their commitment to protecting not only their jobs but also their children's jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that those demonstrations were taking place, I had some concerns which I expressed directly to the individuals and their union leaders when they approached us and lobbied us in the parliament. I felt that they were picking on a particular national group, and I did not agree with doing that be it Irish, Italian or Kiwi. I think in multicultural Australia we should seek to avoid such selectivity in blaming the victim for the ills of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Senator Burns and members of the committee. They have worked long and hard and travelled extensively throughout the land, not only sitting in offices in capital cities taking evidence but going out to meet the shearers, the shearing contractors, the cockies, the farming organisations and so forth. They also did something which I am not particularly in favour of&mdash;I was actually exposed to it myself&mdash;and actually worked on the weekend. They took evidence on the weekend, not on one occasion but on two. They did that in Victoria and in Queensland. They did it out of necessity because during the week the people were working and were not able to give evidence to the committee. So I again commend Senator Burns and those members of the committee who engaged in that weekend activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Burns says, no overtime. Speaking about the weekend activity, I am reminded of the debate that went on in this place in December of last year when it looked like we were going to be sitting on a Sunday. Some people did not want to sit on Sunday. They all forget that as politicians we actually do work on Sundays as well as every other day of the week. We do it in a variety of forms. One of the forms that this committee engaged in was the taking of evidence throughout the weekend, particularly on a Sunday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined the committee in May of last year so I am not the full bottle on all of the evidence that was taken earlier but I was with my colleagues, Senator Brownhill, Senator Calvert, Senator Burns and others when we took evidence in Muttaburra, in outback Queensland, which we were told was a Kiwi town. Before we went there we were told that virtually all the residents of that town were of New Zealand extraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we were there taking evidence we certainly met some but they were not exclusively of New Zealand origin. Some of those who were of New Zealand origin were as much Australian as I or Senator Panizza, because they had made this wonderful country their home. That is something that has to be remembered in debates such as this one. Some of us are luckier than others to have been born in places such as Ireland, Italy, New Zealand or Zimbabwe. But either we or our parents make conscious decisions to settle here. Many thousands of New Zealanders have done that and are settling here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the content of this report, particularly the statistical evidence, will put an end to some of the misinformation that has been abounding on this particular issue. It is not a hope that I am merely expressing in February of 1994; it is a wish and a hope that I expressed during the early part of 1992 when the demonstrations by the shearers first started. I expressed it in fairly forceful terms, directly to the organisers of the demonstrations and the individuals themselves and, indeed, within my own party's parliamentary forum in the caucus. I do believe that there is a concern that issues such as this can get out of hand and that individual national groups could be picked on, particularly in periods of depression. Australia has a history of doing that and it is something we do not look back on with a great deal of pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report could obviously have been much longer, bearing in mind the weight of evidence that was taken from most states of Australia, from many towns and regional centres and from the industry representatives, government departments, shearers themselves and shearing contractors. In its present form the report can be easily read and I commend it not only to the parliament of Australia but most certainly and directly to the union more immediately involved in this particular industry, the Australian Workers Union.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing but admiration for that union and its membership. It operates in very difficult circumstances in the remotest parts of this wonderful land of ours. In order for the organisers to do their jobs of representing the workers, they have to travel vast distances. I did not just come to know of that during the course of this inquiry; I have many friends in the organisation back in my home state of Western Australia. The name of Gill Barr comes quickly to mind, as a person who did an enormous amount of work in organising and protecting the workers in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with any industry, there are goodies and baddies. There are perhaps goodies on the workers' side and baddies on the workers' side, but that is also the case on the employers' side. Some employers will exploit workers, but I would suggest that the majority of employers of shearers in Australia do the right thing by the workers providing the right thing is done back to them. I hope that that certainly will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important recommendation contained in the report is that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy convene a meeting of all parties involved in the industry. I do not have the report open to pick up the exact words of the recommendation, but I believe it is perhaps the most important recommendation. The recommendation is looking to the future. It is a great industry for Australia. There are wonderful people involved in that industry and Australia as a nation will prosper as that industry prospers. If we take advantage of the initiative of the minister in convening a meeting, the skills, experience and goodwill that I am sure are contained on all sides of the debate can be blended together and the industry and Australia can move forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My previous comments on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill were interrupted at the point of the provision which deals with the entry to premises and the taking of fingerprints. For the record, I make it clear that the government has indicated that this provision deals with the taking of fingerprints from the premises and not from the person. That is contained in proposed section 3F(1)(b). If it were to extend to the person, I would vigorously oppose that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to some other aspects of this bill. I preface my remarks with the comment that in the area of search and seizure by police there is a vivid example of the state possibly coming into conflict with the rights of the citizen. Therefore, the regulation of that encounter must be very careful and it must achieve a balance between the rights of the citizen concerned and, of course, the carrying out of the functions of the agency charged with looking after law and order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with that in mind that I look at some of the provisions. I refer to proposed section 3F. I note that on page 18 of the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs the government members recommend that the bill as introduced be passed subject to some proposed amendments, two of which deal with proposed section 3F and relate to the right of the occupier to be present during a search and the fact that receipts are to be provided for all goods seized during the search. I can say to the Senate from experience that a good deal of argument at trial is in relation to items taken at the time of searching the premises. Often there are allegations by the accused that the evidence has been planted. Such allegations can be false or true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility of this parliament is to ensure that the legislation which deals with this matter is as comprehensive and as workable as possible. I am of the view that, wherever possible, it is desirable that the occupier be present during a search. But I fully understand that in some searches the police find themselves in a situation of stress, urgency and possible danger. That is where they enter premises where there might be armed offenders or multiple suspects, and, of course, that has to be looked at in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there could be some provision which states that, wherever practicable, the occupier be present during a search. Often I have represented people where the officers have detained the suspect in one part of the premises and conducted a search in another part. That has caused a good deal of discussion and argument at trial and a good deal of unnecessary cross-examination because, in the circumstances, that person could have easily been present during the search. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of why a person was not allowed to be present during the search has been raised in the minds of juries that I have been involved with. That has been a question of comment in addresses to the jury. I stress that that should be tempered with the practicality of the process so that, if it is a search where there is no danger, where there are no multiple offenders, or where the police have absolute control, there should be some requirement for the person to be present during search. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in proposed section 3K(3)(b) there is a provision which allows `the occupier or his or her representative to be present during the examination or processing' of various electronically stored information. That, quite clearly, canvasses the point I am making in relation to another matter. I ask the government to consider perhaps carrying that through to proposed section 3F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to a receipt for items taken, we should not demand police officers, during a stressful raid or search, to fill out and provide paperwork to the person they have just arrested. Picture a scene where we have a search being conducted, there is evidence on the premises and there are armed offenders. We could not contemplate officers having to stop and provide them with a receipt. I am saying that as soon as practicable after the search the police should make an inventory of things taken and provide it to the accused person or the occupier as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that trials I have been involved in have centred around aspects of what has been taken and, in my view, unnecessarily so in some cases. There have been cases where there has not been that stress or a situation at the time of search and seizure which would not allow such a receipt to be taken. But I say again that that has to be looked at in the context of the police carrying out their duties in a situation which might involve potential danger and trauma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to proposed section 3P, I note that the Democrats had some concern about police obtaining a warrant by telephone or other electronic means. I can fully understand that there may be urgent situations where that is required; but the Democrats requirement that the issuing officer be a magistrate only is not an unreasonable one in the circumstances. In this modern day of communication it is quite possible to get a duty magistrate. That could be a provision looked at rather than extending it to a justice of the peace as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the general provisions dealing with search warrants an issuing officer is either a magistrate or a justice of the peace. That provides some flexibility for the officers concerned and I see no trouble in that. However, something which is transmitted by electronic means could provide a problem if we, say, sent a fax to a justice of the peace who&mdash;as I know is the case in my home state in Western Australia&mdash;could be the local chemist or a person in a remote area. We would have that added assurance if it were a magistrate. I take on board the comments that Senator Spindler made. Perhaps that is a matter which the government could look at in the committee stage and I would welcome any comment that the government might have. That deals with my comments on the obtaining of warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already covered the issue of identification parades. I do not think there is any need to take that any further. As for the requirement to furnish a name and address, as contained in proposed section 3T, I can understand the need for police to ascertain witnesses who might be at the scene. I would not go so far as to say that police be allowed to obtain the names and addresses only of people they suspect have committed an indictable offence. The commission of any offence would be sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia there is a wide power for police to obtain the name and address of any citizen. From my experience, that has not been a situation of abuse. I certainly have not encountered it. There are other areas of police powers which could well be looked at. But, from my experience in Western Australia, that is not one which I have seen readily abused. I can understand that some people might say, `If you are just a witness, why should the police ask you your name and address?'. There is also the query, `If you are not going to provide your name and address, or you are going to prove obstructive, then you would not be a very good witness anyway'. Those perhaps are salient points to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obtaining of information is an important power for police officers in the exercise of their duties. Therefore, I find that that is a question which labours itself somewhat with me. I can understand the concerns of people who say that it might be providing too much power for police to just ask anyone they think might be a witness or involved in some way to provide a name and address. I certainly have no problem, though, with a policeman asking for the name and address of someone who he has reasonable grounds to suspect has committed any offence because that is the first step in the investigative process. I would be interested in the comments on the Australian Federal Police in that regard. Perhaps that is something which can be obtained in the meantime until the committee stage is reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a reasonable bill in the way that it sets out the powers and restrictions on police exercising this very important part of their duties. The uniformity of it has merit. Perhaps it is unfair to expect policemen to labour under different regimes or schemes of legislation in a variety of states. We might have one situation in Western Australia and another situation in New South Wales. Some states are code states; some are not. Of course, I think that is a situation to be taken into account. It may be helpful if the government could look at those matters I have raised. Perhaps those matters could be sorted out in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill and summarise some of the concerns that the Greens (WA) have in relation to the new aspects that are being introduced at this time. This bill enlarges police powers without commensurate protection for those people who may be affected by those powers. The new parts of the bill that we are seeing and discussing today make provision for obtaining and executing search warrants&mdash;including telephone warrants, stopping and searching conveyances, arrest and related matters such as personal searches, taking and destroying fingerprints, holding identification parades and other identification procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter that Senator Ellison just raised is the first one on a list of concerns. This bill creates an offence of not giving one's name and address to a police officer. I must say to Senator Ellison that I have had quite a deal of experience in our home state of Western Australia. I have had so many comments and allegations on the abuse of this power in our state that I begin to wonder whether there is not very substantial basis underlying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There certainly is a discriminatory capacity that can be established within certain police cultures. I am not saying that it exists everywhere or in all situations. In Western Australia, for example, a large group of the population has never seen the side of police culture that would abuse that power or take advantage of it. I know there are many people in Western Australia&mdash;and I among them&mdash;who have never had any problems personally with the police. They have always been very helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, through my work within the criminal justice system, I have seen that people on the other side of the poverty line or socioeconomic status have seen a totally different side to police behaviour. There has been a discriminatory capacity whereby people who already feel somewhat harassed or underprivileged in our society feel even more harassed when a policeman has the power to ask them information without having any correct basis. It can be used as an intimidatory measure and that is something which I do not believe we can afford to encourage in our society, especially when there is an absence of any independent police complaints process and we only have police investigating police. There are times when police culture can be such that giving them powers that may be abused under certain circumstances is very unwise. I believe there is an undue emphasis on allowing this within a state police force, and I am, therefore, concerned about it at a federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 3U(1)(b)(iii) is also an encouragement for police to arrest people rather than issue a summons. In this day and age, we should be encouraging alternative methods to detention. It is extremely costly, for one thing, to arrest people rather than to issue a summons. Issuing a summons is very reliable; there are very few times when it cannot be used. Arresting people is enormously costly to the people personally and in terms of social disruption. There is also a very great economic cost. It encourages police to have an arrest mentality instead of focusing on the positive influence they can have within our community. They can be assisted in their work by the incentive of an orderly approach in responding to a summons rather than using powers to arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 3ZK(7) creates an adverse assumption if a person refuses to take part in an identification parade. Senator Ellison presented the view, with which I agree, that there is an inconsistency here. There seems to be a creeping attack on the presumption of innocence&mdash;a presumption that is very important in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that this bill was severely criticised before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I know that the government, the opposition and the Democrats are preparing amendments to the bill. Hopefully, they will remedy some of the defects that are of concern, and I will await those amendments before saying whether or not we are happy to support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be no change in the position of the opposition. For good reason, we opposed those parts of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) when it came through this chamber some week or two ago. We opposed them on precisely the same grounds as we opposed the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) just before Christmas, and I do not propose to canvass the arguments again. Simply stated, we will not be party to changes in retirement income until the committee set up by the government to look at the whole system reports to the government and we have a considered response from the government to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my speech at the time, there are winners and losers in the proposition. All we have heard from Senator Evans is the winners' side of it, but there are downsides as well as upsides in this bill. We accept that. We are quite realistic about accepting that there are some good points as well as some bad points in the bill. I would like to quote from the final paragraph of the Committee of Reasons, when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to pass the bill as a whole will result in a piecemeal and inconsistent approach to pension assessment by creating differences and maintaining anomalies between social security and service pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely that point about a piecemeal and inconsistent approach to pension assessment upon which our objection to the bill is based. It is wrong for the government to say, `You buy the whole bill or none of the bill'. It is the business of government to present legislation to the parliament, and it is for the parliament to decide what is fitting legislation and what is not. The parliament, in the form of this chamber, has spoken. It has said that we are quite happy to pass this bill, except for one or two clauses. It is quite possible for the government to accept the will of the Senate and to pass the bill as amended and get such things as the seniors health card and other benefits into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing the government can do is to exercise the due process that it has already put in place&mdash;the committee of inquiry. There is no reason why the committee of inquiry, which is now fully set up, with appointees to the committee, cannot report before September. The people on it understand the retirement incomes field and could very well make their report, provided they were given the resources by the government, in quite a short period of time. I do not think a period of more than four to six weeks is unrealistic if the government is sincere about wanting to tackle this problem. If the committee reported within that time, it would then be possible for the government to introduce the legislation in the budget in May this year. Instead, the minister has said, in a very crude attempt to blackmail the parliament, `If you don't pass this bill it will be two years before we get around to doing anything in a legislative form to correct these anomalies'. The parliament is not going to be blackmailed in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can also introduce different legislation that copes with the parliament's wishes. At the end of the day, it should be remembered that the bill, as printed, provides that the parts in contention will not come into law until 1 July 1994. It is only February at present, so the crocodile tears from the government that somehow or other we are being unkind to the community in general will not wash. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This bill is a direct result of a Labor election promise&mdash;a pea and thimble type promise where it took with one hand and gave with the other. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his announcement at the launch of the Labor Party's election campaign, said that women at home would get $30. I know for a fact that a number of women voted for Labor on that basis. Little did they realise that it would be the dependent spouse rebate transferred to the social security area with a very small increase which would then be called the home child-care and partner allowance. So the government gave with one hand, took with the other and, with a sleight of hand and a very small increase of something like $2.60, tricked people into thinking they would get $30 extra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was exactly the theme of the government's campaign: it either tricked the Australian public the whole way along or gave promises that were going to be broken. The Australian public remembers the broken promises very clearly and that message comes home strongly out in the community. This government made promises before the election and then broke those promises, and it made other promises which were really like this one&mdash;a sleight of hand. In its policy document the government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, a Keating Government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse at home caring for children. The new Home Child Care Allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home caring full time for children.</PARA>
<PARA>This initiative was heralded by the Labor Party as a major step forward for Australian families. In reality, for most families it meant no more than an extra litre of milk and loaf of bread a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's record in relation to families needs to be put into proper perspective. There are two million Australian families living in poverty; 400,000 long-term unemployed&mdash;we saw yesterday that those figures have tripled in the past four years; 300,000 families with neither parent working; and family breakdown at record high levels. Australian families will gladly accept the extra loaf of bread and the extra litre of milk&mdash;under Labor, many of them desperately need it&mdash;but this meagre initiative will not solve their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of helping families, the Keating government is very good at putting in one pocket while it takes from the other. As I said before, this is a prime example. On the one hand, the government has introduced a non-means tested home child-care allowance. On the other hand, since the election it has reduced the income and assets thresholds for family payment, extended the income definition for family payment to include employer fringe benefits, applied the family payment income and assets test to student families, limited family payment arrears payments, and sought to transfer 16-year-old Austudy recipients to family payment&mdash;a measure which was blocked by the Senate but which would have left two-thirds of affected families worse off if it had been allowed to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one of these measures to tighten eligibility for family-related benefits was mentioned prior to the election. The government did not tell the Australian public about the tough things; it told them about the goodies and the pea and thimble tricks, and it made the public promises that it did not keep.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the measures I have just listed have been forced onto an unsuspecting Australian public. In total, they will result in savings of in excess of $200 million a year. Senator Crowley informed the Senate committee which looked at this bill that the transfer to the home child-care allowance would cost $230 million a year. This means that the sum of the changes to assistance for families since the election has been basically revenue neutral. The net benefit for Australian families has been a big, fat nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Australian families believed that they would be the great beneficiaries of Labor's largess at the last election. One must ask how long it will be before the hardheads of the Labor Party decide that the home child-care allowance will be means tested. Now that the work of dependent spouses is to be recognised through the social security system and not the taxation system, this new allowance will immediately become a prime target for income and assets testing. Of course, the government will vehemently deny that. However, one needs to look only as far as the family payment to realise that such assurances are totally meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that a number of benefits will be derived from transferring families with dependent spouses and children from the dependent spouse rebate to the home child-care allowance. These benefits include: the home child-care allowance being paid directly to the parent caring for the child or children; the home child-care allowance being paid at a slightly higher maximum rate of $60 per fortnight; families whose tax liability was too low to receive the full benefit of the dependent spouse rebate being eligible for the home child-care allowance; parents leaving the paid work force to care for a dependent child perhaps being able to claim the home child-care allowance even though their income for that financial year may exceed the dependent spouse rebate income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are concerned that a significant number of families with dependent spouses and dependent children who are currently eligible for the dependent spouse rebate will not be eligible to transfer to the home child-care allowance. The commitment by Labor prior to the election clearly indicated that all such families would be eligible to transfer to the home child-care allowance. This is clearly not the case. During the recent Senate committee hearing on this bill, Senator Crowley admitted that some will not be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the Senate some examples of some of the families who will not be eligible for the home child-care allowance as a result of the transfer from the taxation system to the social security system. Families in which either the claimant or the child is out of Australia for a period of over 13 weeks will not be eligible for the home child-care allowance as a result of the differing residency requirements under the social security and income tax assessment acts. Under tax law, it is only necessary to be a taxpayer to be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate. It is envisaged that academic families, aid workers, exchange students and missionaries will be disadvantaged as a result of this anomaly. Interestingly, Australian government officials are effectively protected as they generally receive allowances to compensate them for payments that they are ineligible for because they are overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those families in which the youngest child is a dependent student aged 18 to 25 earning less than $1,875 a year will not be eligible to transfer to the home child-care allowance. This is because the allowance will cut out at age 18 or when the youngest child leaves secondary school, whichever is sooner. Previously, the dependent spouse rebate was paid to families of dependent students aged 18 to 25. Families of prescribed students will also be automatically excluded from the home child-care allowance. Currently, they are not automatically excluded from the dependent spouse rebate but any prescribed student payment, such as Austudy, is considered as income under the separate net income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Differences in the definition of `spouse' and `partner' between social security and tax legislation may mean that some families are unable to transfer to the home child-care allowance. The tax law includes `estranged spouse' in the definition of `spouse' that applies to the dependent spouse rebate; the Social Security Act does not. Tax law does not require that an eligible couple be of the age of consent; the Social Security Act includes such a requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unknown number of families will be excluded from the home child-care allowance due to differences in the definitions of `income' between the social security and taxation systems. Under the Social Security Act, the definition of `ordinary income' for the purposes of the home child-care allowance includes deemed income on bank accounts, any notional capital gains on shares and managed investments, and any deemed income from disposed assets, loans and gifts. Separate net income for the purpose of assessing dependent spouse rebate entitlement refers to a dependent's gross income less expenses incurred in earning that income. It does not include any of the abovementioned examples of income under the Social Security Act. The coalition is concerned that the more onerous income test under the Social Security Act will advertently disqualify from the home child-care allowance families who are qualified for the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee hearing on this bill, coalition senators attempted to find out the number of otherwise eligible families that may be prevented from transferring to the home child-care allowance as a result of differences in residency and age requirements, prescribed student exclusions, and the difference in spouse and income definitions between the taxation and social security systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the tax office nor the Department of Social Security could provide details of the number of families likely to be affected. All we were given were bland assurances that the number of affected families was likely to be low. That is not good enough. It shows a distinct lack of effective planning by the government in the development of this initiative as well as a worrying disregard about its possible adverse impact on individual families. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will</PARA>
<PARA>move a second reading amendment that consideration of this bill in the committee of the whole be postponed until the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) tables amendments to ensure that families are not unjustifiably prevented from transferring to the home child-care allowance from the dependent spouse rebate as a result of differences in the definitions and other relevant provisions between the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also represents another extension in the use of tax file numbers for purposes outside the taxation system. When the tax file number was first introduced, the then Treasurer&mdash;the current Prime Minister&mdash;said that it would only be used by the Taxation Office for tax purposes. Since then we have seen the insidious creep of the use of the tax file number, of which this is another example. A significant number of dependent spouses will be required to provide their tax file numbers to the Department of Social Security for the first time. Some will be required to obtain tax file numbers from the tax office for the first time. As I said, the coalition remains concerned about the ever-widening use of tax file numbers under this government for non-taxation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of concern is the fact that the government is merely paying lip service to privacy and the opinions of the office of the Privacy Commissioner in the development of initiatives such as the home child-care allowance. Documentation provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs indicates that the Privacy Commissioner was given one day in which to respond to the department in relation to this bill. That is not good enough. The Privacy Commissioner was appointed to protect the privacy of the Australian public in issues such as this. As a parliament, we should also be vigilant in matters going to the privacy of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the Privacy Commissioner being given one day to comment on a bill where there is provision for the extension of the use of tax file numbers. I ask the minister to ask the department&mdash;or to ask the government because that is where the buck stops&mdash;why the Privacy Commissioner only had that one day to look at this bill. On behalf of the opposition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion for the second reading, add:  ", but that consideration of the bill in committee of the whole be postponed until there is laid on the Table of the Senate by the Leader of the Government, amendments to the bill to ensure that families in the following circumstances are not unjustifiably excluded from the Home Child Care Allowance as a result of differences, in the relevant definitions and other provisions, between the  Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Social Security Act 1991:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 introduces two new allowances&mdash;the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance. The home child-care allowance replaces the dependent spouse rebate. It is only for couples who have children being cared for at home. The maximum rate of the allowance will be $30 a week, an increase of $2.60 a week over the maximum rate of the DSP. The allowance will be reduced by $1 for every $4 of income earned over $282 a year. This means that carers with incomes of less than $10.85 a fortnight will receive a full payment. The payment will phase out completely when the partner's income exceeds $250 a fortnight or $6,500 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend some time talking about the partner's allowance. Essentially, it splits JSA, newstart, special benefit and sickness benefit so that the partner of the recipient gets a proportion of the benefit. The Australian Democrats share the concern about the actions of any future government&mdash;not necessarily this government&mdash;to move to work test or assets test the second part of the benefit, or in some way to apply additional tests that the partner must meet. Today, I will deal only with what we have before us and express the hope that this is not the beginning of further restrictions on the partner of a recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income that the partner will receive will be the amount over and above the single rate of benefit, and I am very pleased to see this measure introduced. When I came to the Senate in 1990 this was one of the first issues raised with me by people working in various welfare organisations&mdash;particularly the Sisters of St Joseph in Adelaide, who pushed strongly for the splitting of the benefit into two equal parts. While the bill has not gone quite that far, this move will certainly be welcomed by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their shared concern was that some families are unable to come to any sort of reasonable arrangement when it comes to working out how much money should be set aside for essentials, such as food and clothing&mdash;particularly for children. Unfortunately, and for a variety of reasons, the money is often spent&mdash;in most cases, by the male partner&mdash;on non-essentials, with charities then having to supply the essentials for the female partner and children. The measure proposed in this bill goes a small way towards guaranteeing those women their own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that with many families the money will still go into a joint account. As reported in the newspaper today, the vast majority of Australian couples have a joint account. However, with this measure, women will receive money in their own names and that sends the significant message: the partner is also of value and her work in the home is valued. She is entitled to receive this money in her own name and, if she so desires, to move it into an account held in her own name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats took up this suggestion from a number of agencies, in particular the Sisters of St Joseph in Adelaide, and have included it in each of our subsequent alternative budgets. While we did want the payments split down the middle, I acknowledge that the way the government has done it in this case is certainly better than nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted the comments that the home care child allowance is some sort of trick or sleight of hand, but it is no more than replacing one benefit with another, with a very slight income increase in the process. This legislation replaces the dependent spouse rebate, but the fact that we do not consider the amount to be enough does not mean that we should not support something that is a small step in the right direction. It is a long overdue shift in government policy and recognises the value of the work done by those who remain at home. It is about acknowledging the importance of the contribution made by those people, mostly women, who stay at home and care for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, once this work is better recognised and acknowledged by the community, we will have a few more men who are comfortable about sharing that role, with more couples seriously considering taking turns to move in and out of the work force or taking a proportional share of the load of working outside the home as well as doing a fair share of the work that needs to be done inside the home. It is a very small step but a necessary one towards formal recognition of the value of what has been unpaid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is more than just cosmetic. It represents a shift in both philosophy and community attitudes. It signals a willingness to see the role of carer as being an important and valuable one in its own right and one which we should reward financially. It is a major improvement on the old system of the dependent spouse rebate. Under that rebate, the person in employment&mdash;the recognised breadwinner&mdash;received the actual benefit. There was absolutely no way of guaranteeing that the partner knew the value of the benefit, let alone saw any specific increase in the amount of money going towards the family budget on a weekly or a fortnightly basis. The family as a whole received the money but, unfortunately, not always did that flow through to benefit members of the family other than the breadwinner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill ensures that the person who is caring for the children receives albeit a very small amount of money but nevertheless money intended for that person. In other words, such people can get cash in hand, in their own name, and not have to rely on their spouse's goodwill. Both the child-care allowance and the partner allowance make that important distinction, and it is a crucial distinction which has not been recognised until now. It is crucial because, as a direct payment to the partner who is staying at home, it acknowledges the personal costs of caring for those children&mdash;costs which are usually borne by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia at present, the birth of a child signals a clear divergence by gender in what we can best call life opportunities. For women, motherhood generally means an interruption to their paid career, and statistics show that it is often very difficult for them to get back into that career. It also signals a dramatic increase in the amount of domestic duties they have to perform. For men, fatherhood means longer weekly hours of paid work but rarely, if ever, a significant increase in their unpaid work. That discrepancy immediately reduces women's capacity even to keep up to date with their careers and it limits their ability to participate in a whole range of other activities in the community, whether social, sporting or recreational. It is a very heavy price to pay and, as a community, we should be acknowledging that price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this allowance is a very small but significant step along that road. It is also an important step towards creating more flexible employment opportunities for both men and women. As I said before, I hope we will now see more men thinking twice before automatically assuming that it will be the wife who makes that career choice on a long-term or permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to make these changes. Such changes are critical if we are to rethink our definition of work. We have to think again about work patterns. In the long term, if we do not do that, these patterns of work will lead to higher levels of unemployment and increased divisiveness and polarisation of our community. If we are going to avoid those outcomes but still get rid of the gender gap in both paid and unpaid work, we will need to look at strengthening two areas: firstly, more flexible and adequate child care options; and, secondly, the recognition and support of unpaid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the Democrats have called for some formal recognition of the work done by what has been called the invisible work force, most of whom are women. During the last election we called for a taxable means-tested primary care-givers allowance of $80 a week. Under our proposal, dependent partners earning less than $38.50 a fortnight, or $2,000 a year, would receive the full payment of $160 a fortnight. The payment would then be phased out on a dollar for dollar basis, cutting out completely when the dependent partner's income exceeded $235 a fortnight, or $6,100 a year. In other words, we were more generous than the government in terms of the amount of any allowance and the income test limits; but, unlike the government, we felt that the payment should be taxable in order to reduce the benefit to middle and very high income earning families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have a difference of opinion with the government as to the amount and structure and, particularly, the level at which it should be paid, this is not sufficient reason to move in any way against this bill or to seek to delay or oppose it. I find it interesting that so many people have suddenly jumped on the carers bandwagon and, in some cases, are calling for quite spectacular amounts to be paid. I worry about some of these claims because I think there is a real danger that in moving to pay spouses who are staying at home while their partners work we may be overlooking the financial needs of several other groups within the community, in particular those families where neither parent is able to get into the paid work force. That includes sole parent families and carers of aged and disabled people. In many cases, those people are struggling to make ends meet, with the enormous loads they carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we increase the amounts we pay to those caring for children at home, we have to be careful that we do not leave behind a range of other groups in the community who are also in need. It is all very well for us to talk to the media about payments of $130 a week. We have to be very clear about who is going to get that payment, how it is going to be targeted, and how we are going to pay for all of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, I note that Senator Minchin will be speaking after me in this debate. Having read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> last week and noted his call for a universal tax credit for people who stay at home, I ask him whether he could reconcile that call with the comments made on the same day by the shadow Treasurer stating that the Liberals would not support any tax increases in this year's budget and that they would not support any increases in taxes before the next election. Claims such as that for a universal child-care tax credit raise the question: how does the Liberal Party propose to pay for these measures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that Senator Minchin has made some very interesting points. It is good to see more and more people coming out in support of women who stay at home. But if we are not going to raise taxes or introduce new taxes, how are we going to compensate for losing that pool of money from the tax system? We need to be far more honest when we are talking to the community about taxation and equate it with services, because the two go hand in hand. If we are looking for additional support for people who stay at home, we have to acknowledge that the money has to come from somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another alternative is to cut services. Senator Minchin might tell us whether there are any particular services he would like removed. I have no objections to his aims&mdash;indeed, the Democrats have continuously called for acknowledgment of unpaid work. However, we have to be honest and say where the money will come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about these allowances we have to be very careful&mdash;and I have tried to be careful during my speech today&mdash;that while talking generally about women, we should not give the impression of trying to entice women out of the work force to make way for men. I believe that in talking to the media all honourable senators have a responsibility to make it very clear that we are talking about paid versus unpaid work, not women's work versus what was traditionally seen as men's work. I hope we do not get into a situation where we support that very small number of groups in the community whose hidden agenda is to go back to the `good old days' where women stayed home and did the `right' thing by not getting in the way of men's careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will support this bill. It is about giving choice, certainly nowhere near the amount of choice we would like to see; but it is a very small and tentative step in the right direction. We have to move a lot faster and further if we are to give women real choice about whether they stay home and care for their children or whether they try to hang on to a career. As one who made that choice and found that after a few years of child rearing the opportunities to get back into a career were closed, I can certainly speak from first-hand experience and say that we need to look very carefully at how fast we move in this direction and where we go. I stress again that this allowance will not give most families a real opportunity to have one or other partner stay at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot sit down before commenting on Senator Patterson's very strange set of amendments. In nearly four years here, I have never seen an opposition refuse to pass a bill until the government has drawn up its amendments. This bill was originally due for debate on Monday. I cannot remember any time when it has taken me more than two days to have amendments drawn up by the Clerks, unless the amendments were so complicated and relied so heavily on other provisions that they involved some enormous legal technicality. I cannot understand why we have not even seen any attempt at draft amendments and why the government is being asked to plan the opposition's amendments. We see no reason for delaying this bill which needs to go through today. We have already had several days of delay, so we will not support this attachment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Lees on the tenor of her remarks. I will refer to some of the questions she raised about positions I have adopted on this issue. The Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill establishes a home child-care allowance to replace the dependent spouse rebate&mdash;in principle, a welcome move. It publicly provides some recognition of an enormous contribution made to society by principally mothers who make the sacrifice to stay at home to care for their young, particularly pre-school children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we are all aware of the dreadful housewife syndrome that exists in Australia which most manifests itself at dinner parties where a male will say to a woman, `And what do you do?'. If the woman replies `I am a housewife', the male immediately turns to somebody else to have a conversation. It is one of the most disgraceful aspects of Australian society. By staying at home mothers make an enormous contribution to society. Probably the most important job in our society is the nurturing and care of children. Mothers who sacrifice their careers to perform that unpaid task need all the recognition and value that we can give them, and this bill goes some way towards that. As Senator Lees said, the other virtue of the bill is that the allowance is a direct payment to the primary carer&mdash;to the mother and not to the taxpayer. I think that is a good move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson has indicated opposition amendments. In response to Senator Lees, I make the point that it is for the government to deal with the problems we have identified on this bill and we expect the government to come back with the answers to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be acknowledged that the home child-care allowance is not some great act of generosity by the government. We are talking about a mere $2.88 a week for those eligible for the DSR, the dependent spouse rebate. We are not talking about some Santa Claus act by the government&mdash;it is a very small amount. The change to the home child-care allowance, welcome though it may be, highlights the very real problem of government policy discrimination against the very people that I have been talking about&mdash;those mothers who sacrifice an income to care for pre-school children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill shows that the government knows it has a real problem in discrimination between mothers who go to paid work with young children and who put them into child care, and those mothers who do not but who stay at home to look after their children. This was particularly highlighted by the introduction of the act covering the child-care rebate. That aroused great controversy and was very controversial within the Australian Labor Party. The very act of bringing in that child-care rebate and promising it meant that the government knew it had a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having run a lot of election campaigns, I can imagine the thought process. Campaigners during the last election would have said, `If we bring this child-care rebate in, as generous as it is, we will have a very big problem with all the women in society who will not be eligible for this because they are staying at home to look after their children. How will we cope with that in an election campaign environment?'. Someone had the brilliant idea of saying, `Let's just turn the DSR into an allowance. It's not going to cost us much&mdash;a couple of bucks a week on top to make it look like it's all right and bingo, we satisfy that political problem'. That was a classic campaign manoeuvre. It probably paid some dividend for the government but it was, to us, a recognition that the government knew it had a problem in the discrimination between different types of mothers. The reality is that this bill does not deal with that discrimination at all. That discrimination continues to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discrimination is most significant in the following aspects. First, the child-care rebate is not means-tested at all; whereas there is a very significant eligibility test for the home child-care allowance. So that is a very significant element of discrimination. Secondly, they are paid at very different rates: for a mother with two children the difference is 100 per cent. A mother at home with two children gets $30 a week; but a mother who goes out to work gets $60 a week. There is simply no basis for that sort of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of income, there is a child-care rebate of up to $61 a week available to parents with children in external child care. Our response to that was to advocate an income test for the child-care rebate in an attempt to minimise the discrimination in current policy on assistance to mothers with children. But the government, for its own reasons, rejected our proposition. However, the failure to income-test the child-care rebate has manifested this extraordinary inequity with regard to mothers who sacrifice an income to stay at home to look after their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very interested in the recent responses received by my office from mothers who find themselves in this position. The government will probably say that we are just inflaming the situation and stirring things up. But the fact is that this situation is turning mother against mother. It is building up a lot of resentment in the community among those mothers who choose to stay at home. They know they are being discriminated against; they do not understand why. They feel resentful to the government, to politicians, to mothers who put their kids in child care and go out to work, and that is very sad. It is one of the most unfortunate consequences of this most peculiar difference in treatment in which the government is now engaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is income tested. A mother cannot earn more than $282 a year before she starts losing this new benefit at a rate of a dollar for every extra $4 that she earns. So a woman who earns $282 a day or $282 an hour, which some female solicitors probably earn, can get $61 a week for child-care costs. For putting her children into child care the government will, in effect, give her $61 a week. But a woman at home with two children and earning $282 a year will start to lose her benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unbelievable discrimination against those women. It really is inequitable. The fact is that the government right throughout, whatever it says, is biased towards those mothers who make the choice to put their children into child care. There is no doubt about that. We can read all the speeches. The government talks about making it as easy as possible for women to get back into the paid work force and says, `We will look after all the child care for you. If you choose to stay at home, that is tough. Sorry, we are not going to do much for you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there is the home care allowance. We have talked about that. But there is no doubt the bias is in favour of women who choose to go back into the paid work force. This bill does not disguise that. The difficulty with the government's attempts to disguise this problem is that we are getting into the most extraordinarily complex approach to the whole business of assistance to mothers with young children. It is becoming an unbelievable administrative shemozzle. The administrative costs in the Child Care Rebate Act are a scandal in themselves. This will now be administratively complex. The DSR is going to continue for some couples and not for others. In our proposed amendments we have highlighted problems in relation to administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this whole area is becoming unbelievably complex because of the political shenanigans that the government is involved in. I set out the principles that, in my view, should operate in relation to government policy for assistance to parents with young children. The system, whatever it is, obviously should be as simple as possible. Parents with young children find life difficult enough as it is without having to wade through an extraordinary maze of bureaucracy to find out what benefits they are entitled to. That is the current position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most elementary principle should be that of fairness among different mothers in different situations. There should be equity among mothers in relation to their children, whether they are in child care or not. The government should be neutral in its approach to this situation. It is for mothers to decide whether they put their children into child care or whether they care for them at home. That is a decision the mother should make without the government getting involved one way or the other in the making of that choice. So the policy should be neutral in its treatment of mothers in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final principle is that of providing the greatest possible degree of choice for mothers in this situation. We should make it possible for mothers to choose what course they will adopt and what is best for the children in their family situation. I do not believe the government should seek to influence that choice one way or the other. There is no doubt that at the moment government policy, whether consciously or unconsciously, influences that choice in one direction and not in another; and that is towards placing children in external child care. I will not go into all the issues of whether that is good or bad for children. That is a debate in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in this area living standards for most Australians have declined over the last 10 years. Life has become tougher, particularly for young parents with young children. The interest rate saga of a few years ago devastated people in this situation, and they are still paying some of the highest real interest rates in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has led to a situation where the government's own agency acknowledges that at least 60 per cent of mothers who have young children and who are in the paid work force would prefer, if they could afford it, to be at home looking after their children. Whether the government's advisers like it or not, that is what they would prefer to be doing; but economic circumstance forces them to go into the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only fair approach is for the government to treat all mothers equally. That is the only way that a government should attempt to deal with this issue of assistance to mothers with young children. For some time I have advocated a universal approach. That approach should be based on the fact of having young children; not on the fact of whether or not they are in some form of child care that is external, or whether it is with grandparents or the mother. That just leads to the enormous complexity we are now getting into. It is soaking up so many tax dollars simply in administration and not getting through to the people we really want to help. So the only approach is to base it on the fact that a young mother or carer has young children; and make the payment or the benefit according to that criterion&mdash;and no other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have advocated that this should be done as a universal tax credit or benefit that is uniform and flat; and it is paid to mothers or primary carers with young children on the basis of a per child payment. I do not see any other way around it. It is then for the mother or primary carer to choose the form of child care that most suits that carer, whether that be by way of making it more feasible for the mother to stay at home, or whether the mother chooses to spend that money on external child care&mdash;grandmother or next-door neighbour or professional child care. I cannot see why the government is so ideologically opposed to such an approach. It seems to be the only fair approach to avoid the awful situation we are getting to in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees fairly asked the question, `How could society possibly afford such an approach?'. It is a matter of making choices, but it could be done without increasing government expenditure in this area. The fact is that the government is now spending around $8,000 million on assistance to families with young children&mdash;$8 billion. There are about four million children in Australia under 15. If we take the age to 15, the number is four million. Obviously the simple mathematics of that is that, without spending an extra dollar, the government could provide $2,000 per annum for every child in Australia under the age of 15 in the form of a benefit for those not paying tax, or a tax credit for those who are paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, even if it is the high-income female solicitor we are talking about, if she is paying $20,000 a year tax, the credit would equate to provide her with a tax bill of $18,000. The mother who chose to stay at home and look after her children would get $2,000 benefit in tax credit in her hand for every child that she has, thus making it more feasible for her to make that choice to stay at home. But it remains her choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in answer to Senator Lees, what I am proposing would not involve additional expenditure. It would be nice if, as a community, we could afford to make it more than $2,000. Those are choices that society would have to make. I would probably be one for advocating reductions of expenditure in other areas to make it a more feasible proposition to go to a higher level. But it could be done now in a way that would provide real material benefit and real choice to mothers with young children, without increasing government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, while in principle we welcome the principles of it, does highlight the current inequities in the government's treatment of mothers with young children. The government needs to deal with it because the problem is only going to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I cite the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of 20 February which, by dealing with this matter in an editorial and giving it front page treatment, shows that it is becoming a community issue. The government is going to have a real problem in this area unless it does something about it. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure it will get it correct. I, too, have done some work on this. I have the figures that support the statement that Senator Minchin made, that it is possible to abolish the various allowances and introduce a homemakers allowance&mdash;a phrase that has been used previously&mdash;and produce revenue neutrality. I will be happy to supply that to Senator Lees. The year 1994 is the International Year of the Family, a time to stand back and look at what the family really is and perhaps, more importantly, what the family will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways I feel that 1994 comes too late to be asking ourselves, `What is the family'? For many reasons the International Year of the Family will be a history lesson: a time to reflect on what the family was; a time to realise what we have lost; and a time to compare the family of yesterday with the stark contrast of what this government has left for the family unit of today. In the aftermath of the worst recession in 50 years, brought about by the Labor government&mdash;the Senate will recall the Prime Minister saying it was the recession we had to have&mdash;it is a wonder that families have survived. Divorce has become a fact of everyday life for nearly half of all Australian families. We have witnessed an alarming rise in the rate of reported cases of child abuse, spouse abuse and teen homelessness. Combine these factors with the harsh burden of the economic recovery, and the toll of modern life falls hardest on the innocent and the helpless&mdash;the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year of the family we have already had the social engineering by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, and her child-care accreditation guidelines. This is just another case of government deciding what is best for the children and totally ignoring the views of the parents. What a way to start before we have even begun!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care and partner allowances were yet another carrot the government dangled in front of a hungry electorate in the lead-up to the last election. They were yet another example of an ill conceived and deceptive election promise that will end up costing a fortune to implement and bring very little comfort to the people that matter&mdash;in this case, the carers and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not seek to oppose this bill. On the contrary, anything that can help sustain Australian families and give them the much needed support that this government has failed to provide for them over the past 11 years is something the coalition gladly welcomes. The coalition welcomes this as much as we do the final admission by this government that it has failed to address the serious consequences of its decade of economic and social policy mismanagement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, just like every promise we have heard from this government, a quick look at this proposal reveals a hasty and ill conceived piece of election propaganda that translates into a hasty and ill conceived piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim by the government that this new set of allowances will bring vast sums of money to more Australian families is simply false. The fact remains that the income of most families under these new allowances will not change, for these allowances are not so much an increase but a redistribution of funds. Certainly we will see some new recipients receiving allowances under these new programs, but at the same time it is estimated that over 116,000 families will simply stop receiving benefits. We have this complex and intricate legislation which requires us to pass an amendment just to close the loopholes and flaws present in the earlier legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what I mean when I say that this is but one of the ill conceived and precipitous promises that the government makes to the weary electorate, ignoring the costs involved. Ignoring the obvious cost of such failed promises on the public's perception of government and parliament, we have the cost of the intricacy of this legislation that will feed a ravenous bureaucracy, ready to consume some $200 million in administration costs. A simpler and more equitable solution would be to provide the at-home parent with the allowance and avoid the bureaucratic monster that consumes so much of our social welfare payments. Let us avoid the means testing and all the complexities that beset such programs and focus on getting the money quickly and directly to those who need it, as Senator Minchin mentioned&mdash;that is, the carers and their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the words of Senator Lees that this legislation has not gone far or fast enough. The most important career in and for society is the nurture and care of young children, and yet there is discrimination in this legislation against those who stay at home and care for young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the coalition does not seek to oppose this bill. We had referred it to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to look at the shortfalls of this legislation, and there are many. In 1994, we have the opportunity as legislators, as parents and as children to ensure that the year of the family is not just another token 12 months to political correctness. I have said that 1994 is a little late to be focussing on the issues of the family when our most important social unit is feeling the burdens of modern life more than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us ensure that the year of the family is not just a bandaid for the suffering that Australian families have been enduring. I see this legislation as one such bandaid. Let us make certain that we use our resources and the precious time left this year to encourage a society in which the families of today can grow and strengthen so that they, in turn, may lay the foundations for a secure and stable society for tomorrow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to comment on the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. I support the amendment moved by Senator Patterson. The bill is not urgent to be passed today, as Senator Lees indicated. It could be withdrawn and sent back to those who have drafted it for the amendments which clearly ought to be included in it to make the bill cover the range of people who ought to be covered by what the government is doing for a few. I think the way that has been proposed is totally appropriate. I hope that the government will do that, although I sense it will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a bill that one would have expected to have been received quite enthusiastically and supported, and perhaps not even to have attracted much debate or attention at all, but there are some very good reasons why it is that it needs to be exposed for what it is. Senator Lees saw it as&mdash;I think I am quoting accurately&mdash;a small and significant step along the road towards recognising carers. She referred to it as being a shift to recognising the carer. So it is, up to a point, but it goes much further than that when it is compared with the child-care rebate, and that is what we must do to fully understand the philosophy of the Labor Party towards women and children by what is exposed in this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was, as has been indicated, a promise from the Labor Party during the last federal election. It also is an idea that came from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, when it inquired into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia. It too recommended that the dependent spouse rebate be replaced with a payment directly paid to the parent caring for children. That is recognised in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the actual amount being paid has been withdrawn totally from so many families, as has been pointed out. I do not think anybody at the time of the last election realised that that fishhook was in the promise. It was, I think, genuinely perceived to be a replacement for the dependent spouse rebate&mdash;as it was&mdash;that would be paid to the person caring for the children. It was only a minuscule increase to $30 a week. But I think most people saw it as a genuine attempt to recognise the role of the carer, even though the amount being paid was virtually no different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the fact that so many families have lost this allowance that comes as a real shock to a lot of people. I do not think they realised exactly what the government was attempting to do. That is the most significant aspect. It is to be means tested on the income of the recipient&mdash;I recognise that&mdash;and the person at home caring probably does not have a very high income, but it is means tested on an income of $282 per annum. To set up the infrastructure to be means testing this for an amount of $282 a year just seems absolutely incredible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It indicates quite clearly that the government's attitude to minding children is an issue of welfare. It is in stark contrast to the attitude to the child-care rebate which was debated in this place not long ago. To receive the full $60 a fortnight the parent who is caring for the children has to be in receipt of less than $10.85 a fortnight. The amount of $60 a fortnight gets cut back, up to an income of $250 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a mother who has two pre-school children in care can receive $63 a week no matter how high her income. The mother who is at home looking after her children will receive $30 a week, no matter how many children, means tested at the rate I have indicated. I have two daughters with one child each and it so happens that they fall one into each of these categories. Why they should be treated in this fashion and why one's contribution should be discriminated against to such an extent leaves me almost speechless&mdash;but not so speechless that I was not able to get up today and express my views on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that there should not be a child-care rebate, as introduced, but the manner of these two payments, the attitude towards them, is absolutely staggering. Leaving aside even the amount, it is the attitude to women and children and the government's picking of models of families who will or will not be supported that I find absolutely incredible. This says an enormous amount about the Labor Party's attitude to children and to carers. The Labor Party has really exposed itself for what it is with this piece of legislation. All carers&mdash;whether of children, old people or whomever&mdash;should take note of the real attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This payment is means tested and is a welfare payment. The child-care rebate is paid by the Department of Family Services through its children's services program&mdash;a much more costly system because it is a new system being put in place, whereas social security could have dealt with that as well. It distinguishes between types of people. A woman at home caring for her child is a welfare recipient of a means-tested pittance&mdash;the home care allowance we are referring to today. A woman at work may receive a child-care rebate. She may be earning $100,000 a year but she is still eligible to receive it because it is her right, and it is not means tested. I do not see how the government can possibly justify to the women of Australia dealing with women and children in these two discriminatory fashions. One is a welfare payment; one is a right. One family is treated cheaply; one family is treated generously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rhetoric of the International Year of the Family is exposed, I believe, by the comparison between the home child-care allowance and the child-care rebate. I can recall in days gone by Senator Button talking about the government not playing favourites when it came to industry and not supporting one or the other. One would have thought that, in legislation such as this, neutrality towards the status of women and children would have been maintained. If for a period a woman wanted to remain at home and care for her young children, that would be recognised as a reasonable, honourable and decent thing to do. If she wanted to be in the work force and have her children cared for commercially, that too would be an honourable, decent and worthwhile way of doing it. It is not a question of picking one or the other,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Labor Party does just that, and it discriminates enormously against one type of woman. The favoured model of family for the Labor Party is being rewarded. Why is the other model of family not similarly rewarded? Both should be administered by the same department and both should be treated in the same way, that is, not means tested. Perhaps they should both be receiving the same amount of money, but that is getting into another area again. There are two other things that ought to be cleared up before one even starts thinking about that. I urge the government to withdraw this piece of legislation and bring it back in a way that is reasonable to the women of Australia who have young children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill. We heard recently the remarks in this chamber by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) about this being the International Year of the Family. Obviously, child care is an issue critical to all families. It is because of this that I wish to take the opportunity to speak briefly about the substantial increase in assistance to over 800,000 families throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I turn my attention to the home child-care allowance component of this bill, which is a major initiative in this special year and is indicative of the government's commitment to ensuring that families are regarded as an important entity requiring assistance, especially where children are involved. The focus of this allowance is the substantial contribution in the majority of cases made by mothers in the care of their children. This bill recognises and redresses this vital work, which for far too long has been looked upon in the traditional family as secondary to the work performed by the breadwinner or income earner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance is the balancing option to the government's assistance to child care, which is provided through income-tested fee relief to working parents who use approved services. The essential features of this new allowance, which replaces the dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children and which will be paid from 29 September, are as follows: a regular fortnightly payment will be made directly to the dependent partner of a couple with a dependent child or children. The maximum rate allowed will be $60 per fortnight, which is approximately $6 per fortnight higher than the current maximum rate of the dependent spouse rebate. In fact, a total of $1.37 billion will be spent on the home child-care allowance. This amounts to an increase of over $230 million. I stress that, because it means that not only will there be an increase for current recipients of the rebate but also a larger number of current recipients are expected to receive the maximum payment rate under the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another big plus in this bill is the fortnightly basis on which payments will be made by the Department of Social Security instead of the yearly tax concession under the current rebate system. That will allow a greater flexibility in meeting the week to week needs of families looking after children at home. The allowance will be subject to an income-based test only on the income of the partner caring for the child or children. It will not affect the dependent spouse rebate for couples without children or the sole parent rebate. Importantly, the allowance will not be subject to an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report from the coalition senators raises the point that under the Social Security Act families that are absent from Australia for longer than 13 weeks will be excluded from the allowance. It is important to note that as soon as the recipients return they qualify to receive the allowance from the date on which they return. The dissenting report also raises the requirement for a tax file number. In a number of cases, this will need to be acquired from the Taxation Office. There is no doubt that in the overwhelming majority of cases most families would have already provided their tax file number. It is disappointing that the dissenting report has used this requirement as a basis to knock the legislation when there are in place very strict guidelines under privacy principle No. 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this allowance means more in the pocket of the dependent partner, with the added advantage of the fortnightly payment. In a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) dated 7 April 1993, the National Secretary of the Women's Action Alliance said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also congratulate you on converting the dependent spouse rebate to a direct payment to women who are caring for children at home. Women's Action Alliance has called for this measure since our inception in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an important breakthrough for those women because for too long they have been defined as out of the workforce when in fact they are performing vital work in our society.</PARA>
<PARA>I move briefly to the relevant section involving partner allowance. Additional payments previously made to recipients of job search allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance will be paid directly to the dependent partner as a partner allowance. This can be described as a fairer way to distribute such funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me mention some of the other essential factors in the paper. The bill will not impose any activity requirements on the recipient of partner allowance. The additional amount of allowance currently payable in respect of a dependent partner or persons in receipt of job search allowance, newstart allowance, sickness allowance or special benefit will no longer be available. The person will need to lodge a separate claim for partner allowance. The person will need to be an Australian resident in order to qualify for the allowance. Finally, the allowances will, appropriately, be able to be paid to the recipient in this important international year. </PARA>

They are going to find in September that they are going to be short of 28 bucks, and they are going to wonder what the heck is going on and where it has got to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to what was stated by the Prime Minister in his election promise to pay mums at home. We saw the advertisements: $30 a week to be paid to mums at home. How is that going to be financed? The government has got it all sorted out. It is going to be financed by taking it out of the wages of the spouses that work, whether that be a male or a female, and placing it into the hands of the person who is caring for the children. In normal circumstances, that will mean taking money out of the hip pocket and putting it into the purse. There is nothing wrong with that, but let us be straightforward about it. That is not a home child-care allowance. It is going to mean $2.85, irrespective of the number of children who are cared for. Honourable senators should compare that to the amount of money that is spent on institutionalised care and to the millions of dollars ploughed into institutionalised child care. </PARA>

If we look at the amount of money that has been ripped off workers to be paid this, the amount of money that is going to be ripped off families&mdash;and some families are going to be worse off under this measure&mdash;then we will see that it is likely to be revenue neutral. In fact, the Prime Minister did admit that this was going to be revenue neutral. People can shake their heads as much as they like.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on a matter of public interest, since Senator Crowley was so ungracious as not to give me leave when we gave her leave. The issue that was raised here was in fact an important issue. Senator Crowley said that the advisers were giving her advice. I would ask Senator Crowley to ask the advisers to give advice in such a way that it is not off-putting to the speakers. When advisers are shaking their head when someone is speaking, one begins to think that there is something wrong with what one has said. They might disagree on terms of policy, but it is totally inappropriate. I think it was an inappropriate response from the minister to the issue that was debated. I think this is an issue that will be debated again and we will watch very carefully how advisers behave in the box.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a case commonly known as the 14 Western District farmers v. NIAA Corporation in receivership. The Western District farmers are being sued by liquidators for Ernst and Young for debts totalling almost $1 million of a Warrnambool stock agent, Mr Murnane. The Warrnambool agent was assigned to collect the farmers' debts and pass them onto NIAA Corporation Ltd. For example, Mr Brophy, one of the farmers, paid $77,000 to Mr Murnane, which was kept and not passed on to NIAA Corporation. The liquidators are suing him for the money stolen, plus interest and charges totalling $148,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not seek to go into the intricacies of the case, it is sufficient to say that the case will be fought over whose agent was Mr Murnane. Was Mr Murnane the agent for the farmers or was Mr Murnane the agent for NIAA Corporation Ltd? The liquidators, Ernst and Young, are claiming that the Warrnambool stock agent was the agent for the farmers, so they will be able to claim that the debt was never received. However, the opposite is clearly true and it is the just point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an opinion given in March 1992 by Mr D.L. Harper QC, who now sits in the Supreme Court. It answers this question. In Mr Harper's opinion, every test for a principal and agent relationship between the collector of the farmers' debts, Mr Murnane, and NIAA Corporation was satisfied. It should also be noted that it is alleged that the liquidators, Ernst and Young, were in control of the failed finance company and were aware that the agent, Mr Murnane, was operating illegally, yet they did not pass this knowledge on to the farmers. So it is alleged that they failed to exercise their duty of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of all of this is that the farmers are being asked to pay their debt twice, and they simply cannot afford to do this. We have seen situations where farmers have been dragged from their land for not paying their debts. Now we are seeing the quite bizarre situations where farmers will be dragged from their land for paying their debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday it was announced that the National Farmers Federation will intervene in what now has developed into a bitter row between the farmers and the liquidators, Ernst and Young. The NFF's president, Mr Graham Blight, will meet the liquidator, Mr Geoff James, of Ernst and Young in Sydney in a bid to settle the matter before it reaches the New South Wales Supreme Court next Monday. The NFF agreed last week to recommend to the trustees of its fighting fund that, if a settlement cannot be struck, $125,000 will be released to help fund the court battle against the liquidator. The support of the NFF is most welcome. I note that Mr Bill Bodman from the Victorian Farmers Federation was a very strong voice in securing the fighting fund money and I wish to congratulate Mr Bodman on his good judgment and genuine representation of the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, I believe that the support given by the NFF, its president, Mr Graham Blight, and its executive director, Mr Rick Farley, signals a renewed determination by the farmers federation to help, to fight for and to represent every member. It is comforting to know that the NFF, with its powerful resources, is still watching over the farm sector, striking at issues which are of core concern to farmers, issues which expose them to predatory practices of individuals or groups which would otherwise prey on their vulnerability&mdash;their financial weakness. As only the NFF can, it has struck out at those who sit in their marbled central business district offices. In the past, the NFF has not been without its critics, but this case shows that the skills and presence of the NFF are still much valued by the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the liquidator from Ernst and Young, Mr James, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 22 February as saying that he had great sympathy for the Western District farmers. I hope that this is a very genuine empathy. From my dealings with Ernst and Young over this issue, I wonder whether that is the case. However, if it is, events will prove it to be so, and there will be an amicable, generous and agreed settlement before this matter proceeds to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few points in closing. I believe that the Western District farmers and the liquidator from Ernst and Young have fallen through a legislative trapdoor which should not have been left open in the very first place. We now see the farmers fighting for justice, as they see it, and for their livelihoods. We now also see an accounting firm with one of the most readily identifiable corporate profiles in this country caught up in very wasteful litigation and headed for conflict with the nation's premier farmers' representative body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has come to pass because the law, as it is, allowed for such confusion and conflict to happen in the first place. There is nothing to stop this terrible case from happening tomorrow, next week or next year to another group of farmers. Others will fall through the trapdoor until the law is changed. The farmers and the liquidators are not going to claim any victories from this regardless of the outcome of the court proceedings. The farmers have wasted their finances, taken out extra loans, put their families at even greater risk in an effort to win what they see is a matter of principle and one on which the livelihoods of all farmers hinge. They have done this at enormous personal cost and it should never have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the parliamentary corporations and securities committee, I believe there should be an amendment to the Corporations Act to protect vulnerable individuals or groups and to avoid the wasted round of conflict and litigation which has swallowed up the farmers. This is not a very difficult request; it can be done with ease and some careful drafting so the expectations and responsibilities in cases like the one I have outlined are not repeated. The vacuum in the law caused this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of this, it is the responsibility of legislators to ensure the law is changed and the community shielded from needless reruns of the whole issue. Farmers should have recourse to law when they are confronted by those in a much stronger financial position. Firstly, they should not&mdash;as is the position now&mdash;be put in a situation where there is no law and where they have to plough all their personal resources into the court system in order to clarify their legal standing. This is not the farmers' responsibility; it is the parliament's responsibility to get the law right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the whole system of stock agents' relationships with farmers requires review and reform. This, of course, is principally an issue for the states. Thirdly, we should also have a look at the stark inadequacies of the bank code. If we had an effective and legislated bank code, or at least a set of working principles to head off conflict and manage farm debt, we would never be in the combative environment we are in now re the Western District farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this case has much to do with the mopping up of the reckless 1980s and a need to cover ourselves in law so such issues may never again rise to the personal detriment of the lives of many farmers or, for that matter, the detriment of the community standing of the financial institutions in which there is already dwindling public confidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that I should follow Senator McGauran here today because I want to raise the same kinds of problems that he has just addressed. I make reference to a question I asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) yesterday. I certainly thank him for the answer that he gave because it was comprehensive and addressed the questions I asked to a certain extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as one would expect, he mentioned a number of government programs which were part of the answer to the question. What I want to do today is to point out the problem as I see it as being much deeper than simply addressing specific issues by a program here and a program there. Most of the programs mitigate the effects of rural decline rather than arresting or reversing it. For instance, the rural adjustment scheme is really about helping people get out of farming. Much of the counselling which has been very much appreciated is also towards that end. The programs in these instances do not stop or reverse the decline, and that is what I am concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other programs do address specific problems, but it seems to me that that approach is piecemeal. What the Australian Democrats are calling for is a total approach to rural and regional development, for a political commitment which really is prepared to address the climate of decline in rural Australia and say, `We have a political commitment to reverse that, to restore resources and people and hope to the bush'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer to my question yesterday, the minister mentioned the ABARE conference held earlier this year, in which the assessment was made that the decline in the viability of rural industry had bottomed and it was now on its way up. However, the minister also admitted that much of that improvement is based on further increasing the size of farming properties. Of course, this will mean a further decline in rural population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The slogan `Get big or get out' is still the basis for much of the operation of our primary industries. But that slogan is in fact part of the problem. It is part of what has caused the debts for many family farmers, and is the reason that they are now being foreclosed. The high interest rates of the 1980s represent nothing less then usury. In fact, it is the reason that many family farmers find themselves in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago I made mention of contacts that I have in some small country towns in Queensland&mdash;St George, Mitchell, Injune and Biloela. These are places where family farmers are facing the end of two, three and even four generations of residency and working on the land. I believe we are facing something that cannot be dealt with by piecemeal programs. It is something that needs an overall political commitment that says, `We want to see rural Australia and rural communities survive'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I visited a small community near Mount Gambier in South Australia and met with a group of women who call themselves Rural Women for Social Justice. They told me stories of domestic violence in families which had never experienced that kind of situation before. They told stories of suicides that are reported as vehicle accidents, but which are deliberate acts by people who can no longer cope with the situation they are in, and of families where they can no longer afford for their children to go to school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the human face of the statistics that we are so prone to play with from time to time. I want to quote from a press article this week. The heading of this press article is enough&mdash;`After the death of Letona, the rot sets in'.

Again, the picture which is presented is a very depressing one of what is happening to our rural communities. Not only is the impact a domestic one, not only is it something which is happening in Australia, but also it has international implications. Let me quote, again from this article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More serious even than the local impact of such a decline&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Taylor says&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I believe that sums up exactly what I am trying to say. I believe that what we need here is not programs and is not simply help to people to get out of rural industry. What we need is a political commitment which says that we really do believe in the bush; that we do believe in the country areas of Australia; that we do believe in rural industry; that we do believe in rural communities; and that we are going to make the commitment which will enable them not only to survive, but to grow and to make the contribution which we know they are capable of making to this great country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter of very great concern to me and, I think, to quite a number of Australians, judging by the interest in this particular case. It concerns the sacking of two housekeepers at the Lodge, almost five months ago now. This issue continues to cause community concern and continues to attract media interest, I think for the simple reason that people want to see some justice and fairness done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate will recall, last October two housekeepers at the Lodge received a phone call on a Sunday night and were told that they were not to report for duty the following day. Therein, of course, lies the dispute. In a subsequent hearing of a Senate estimates committee the department raised some concerns about some of the issues of conduct of the housekeepers. The housekeepers, for their part, totally reject the allegations of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an issue here of justice and fairness to these people. They feel that they performed their duties appropriately, and indeed the department issued a certificate of service which in effect says that. There is certainly plenty of evidence around, both verbal and written evidence, that they got on very well with Mr and Mrs Keating. In fact, Mr Keating, I think yesterday, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS> said that he had no complaints against their service in the Lodge and that it was a matter for the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point in bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate today is this: in order for these two housekeepers to attempt to right what they see as an injustice, they have sought to bring their case to the ombudsman. It causes me great concern that the ombudsman decided yesterday not to take up this case and has said that it is not appropriate for her to do it because it would be, in effect, reviewing the decision of a minister, in this case, of course, the Prime Minister, who in effect, according to the ombudsman, technically made the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, on the other hand, says it is a matter for the department. Mr Keating says, `I got on well with these two housekeepers. This whole issue of their retrenchment is a matter for the department'. So this is the dilemma the two housekeepers are faced with. On the one hand, the ombudsman says that she cannot take a role in this because, in a sense, it is a matter for the Prime Minister and he, in a technical sense, was responsible for their retrenchment. On the other hand, the Prime Minister says it was not his responsibility; it was the responsibility of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the officers involved in that department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the housekeepers are faced with a major dilemma. Where can they put their case? Where can they receive what they see as a chance to have an independent opinion on this issue and see whether there are any matters regarding possible compensation and a possible setting to right officially of their record in the Lodge? The Prime Minister, despite his nice comments about the housekeepers, seems to me to have washed his hands of the issue and, indeed, so has Philippa Smith, the new ombudsman. I think that is a pity. The dilemma is what now happens five months after this particular event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no profound opinion on what should be done. All I know is that these people feel that a wrong has been done and would like to see whether, in some ways, it cannot be righted&mdash;at least to their satisfaction. I just wonder whether this is not a matter that Mrs Keating might take an interest in. The Prime Minister has certainly decided it is not for him; the ombudsman has decided it is not for her; and I really wonder whether Mrs Keating herself may wish to take a particular role in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to say that I am across all the facts involved here. All I know is that they feel that they want to have this matter looked at in an independent sense, to see whether these issues cannot be resolved. So I hope that this whole issue can be closed off and finished to the satisfaction certainly of the housekeepers and, I hope, to the satisfaction of all those concerned. I wonder whether one particular way out of it may be for Mrs Keating to take a particular interest in this and see whether she cannot use her influence and good offices to assist in the resolution of what is, in my view, a most unfortunate matter. </PARA>

By way of preface, I refer to the question which I asked the minister last night at the meeting of Senate Estimates Committee A regarding the possibility of a review of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. Is the minister able to inform the Senate whether he has given further consideration to any inquiry into ASIS? If so, what view has he formed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night at the Senate estimates hearing I indicated that the government had been giving consideration to the question of a comprehensive external inquiry into the operation and management of ASIS and that I retained an open mind on that particular question. I am able to say now that the government has decided, in principle, to set up a judicial inquiry into the operation and management of ASIS. It is our intention that it be headed by a judge, but it is not yet possible for me to make an announcement as to who that person will be. Similarly, questions relating to the specific terms of reference, to the powers of the inquiry, its mode of operation and matters of that kind are currently being addressed. I would expect to be in a position to make an announcement soon, hopefully as early as next week, in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do envisage that the sorts of issues to be addressed by the inquiry would include, first, control and accountability mechanisms, including the question of a possible legislative charter for the organisation; secondly, questions of administration and management generally; thirdly, and more particularly on the management side, the operation of grievance mechanism and complaint resolution structures, and whether there is any need for attention there; and, fourthly, the whole question of the protection of intelligence assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition might be minded to say this is a response to the call made yesterday by Mr Peacock for a judicial inquiry. Let me say a couple of things about that and about some related matters said yesterday and in the press this morning. For the record, I quickly say that the position as I have expressed it does not amount to any kind of turnaround, either last night or today. Yesterday, in answers I gave in question time and elsewhere, I studiously avoided the whole question of a judicial inquiry. I was asked about a parliamentary oversight process, about which I expressed some reservations. I was asked about data collection systems. I said nothing substantive then or at any other time on the question of a judicial or other form of external inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, perhaps, the question of a comprehensive inquiry into the factors I have mentioned has been under active consideration by me for some little time now&mdash;certainly for several weeks. It did completely pre-date&mdash;notwithstanding what anyone might be minded to say&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report on Monday night. I said a little about the reasons for that during the estimates hearing last night, but let me repeat them. The reasons for that were essentially these considerations: firstly, there is a case for regular root and branch review of organisations that, by their nature, are necessarily very closed and secretive. Such reviews would focus, in particular, on questions of control and accountability. The last such review was conducted nearly 10 years ago by Mr Justice Hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is the consideration that the Cold War is over. That has led to a lot of thinking about the character of these organisations, and it raises questions here, as it did in the United Kingdom, about the desirability of a legislative charter rather than the kind of executive direction which has been regarded in the past, particularly in a Cold War atmosphere, as appropriate for that kind of organisation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there has been some significant increase in ASIS's funding over the last couple of years, and a change in the configuration of its operations&mdash;a change that has been made in parallel in this respect with other organisations in the intelligence community, again associated with the end of the Cold War.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the short answer is that which was offered by way of interjection: wait and see the outcome in the budget. I am glad to see that Senator Short has at least learned something since his question yesterday. There are several different questions rolled up in this question of whether there is any inconsistency in what the government has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the question is whether or not we will introduce any new taxes. A lot of the consideration there depends on what one chooses to characterise as a tax and whether it is in fact a tax or revenue measure. I said it is perfectly well understood, as a matter of constitutional law and legislative practice, that revenue measures may be on the one hand taxes; on the other hand, they can have the character of fees, charges or levies. In that particular context, as I said yesterday, there is an unresolved question as to whether or not the government would go down the path of introducing a jobs levy. That matter has been canvassed as a possibility; it has not yet been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the part of the question referring to any other new tax, I do not think there is any question of the government doing that because that has been said on a number of occasions as not to be within the realm of possibility. But I put the jobs levy to one side as still a possibility, whether or not one chooses to call it a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of increases in existing taxes, of course, as the Treasurer has said, as finance ministers have said and as governments have said from time immemorial, one cannot rule out that possibility as part of the overall consideration of the budget. That kind of consideration is always on the table. But what we will not do&mdash;this is the nub of Senator Cook's interjection yesterday&mdash;is increase the overall burden of taxes. We will not increase the overall burden of taxes in the sense of taxation as a proportion of GDP, which is down now to a lower level than it was through most of the 1980s, and that remains an election commitment and one that we are firmly attached to. But, apart from that, all these questions are highly speculative, hypothetical and premature. These are issues that will be resolved in the budget context.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In the light of the minister's continued refusal to answer clear and precise questions on whether the government will repeat in this year's budget its habitual pattern of broken promises on tax and on a huge range of other issues&mdash;the basis on which it lied its way back into office at the last election&mdash;the Senate can only assume that the big lie is on again. So I give the minister one last opportunity to refute that by again inviting him to tell the Senate whether or not the government will be introducing new revenue or tax measures or will be increasing existing revenue measures in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for asking an economic question of importance for Australia. The ABS today released two sets of data pertaining to the pace of economic recovery currently under way in Australia. The first set was the preliminary figures on new motor vehicle registrations for January. Motor vehicle registrations have evidenced considerable volatility in recent months; nevertheless, the increase in January of 6.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms now sees the level of registrations some nine per cent above that of a year ago. More importantly, the trend estimates are some six per cent higher than for January 1993&mdash;cause, I might say, for continued optimism that the recovery already evident in other sectors is beginning to be reflected in the motor vehicle industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS also released figures on company profits for the December quarter of last year. These show a four per cent rise in trend terms over the September quarter. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of growth in company profit numbers, which are now some 26 per cent higher than in the December quarter of 1992 and are at their highest level since this ABS series began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures come on top of mounting evidence from a number of sources that the pace of economic activity, which clearly accelerated in the second half of 1993, is continuing to gather momentum. Strong increases in the major job vacancy series suggest that the employment growth, which has seen an increase in trend terms of 155,000 in the seven months to January 1994, should continue to be robust. Consumer and business confidence measures in recent months have reached levels not seen since the late 1980s. In volume terms, retail turnover increased by 1.9 per cent in the December quarter, the highest rate of growth since September 1991. Despite the subdued levels of economic activity in much of the rest of the world, net exports have continued to provide a strong contribution to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is clear evidence that the government's economic policies are working and that Australia is now well placed to reap the benefits of the significant transformation this government has achieved in the structure of the economy. A key part of the government's policy framework is the medium-term deficit reduction strategy, aimed at ensuring that Australia is able to fund the necessary pick-up in investment in new productive capacity that is crucial to ensuring that the recovery in activity and jobs is a sustainable recovery, and to finance a larger proportion of it domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamentals are now particularly encouraging for investment. Not only is corporate profitability at an historic high, but also interest rates are at a 20-year low and inflation is at a 30-year low. This has underpinned a quantum improvement in Australia's international competitiveness. In the face of all that, there is further evidence that spare capacity is beginning to fall notably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures are beginning to show the nature of the change and the improvement. Underlying business investment in plant and equipment increased by six per cent in the September quarter, underpinned by the upward revision recently announced by the Treasurer of the government's forecast for 1993-94 from one-quarter of one per cent in year-average terms to 4 1/4 per cent. It is now up to the business sector to step up and meet these challenges and the opportunities posed for Australia's improving economic circumstances and to take advantage of the favourable investment climate we now have. One should not overvalue these figures, but they clearly show that the recovery is gathering pace, the prospects for the economy are brighter, and the prospects for people looking for employment are better.</PARA>

Recent government statements have indicated that assistance for the long-term unemployed will be an important part of the May budget&mdash;and rightly so. I ask: how will the government be defining long-term unemployment? It seems to us that a bit of shifting is going on. Will it use the long-accepted definition of more than 12 months unemployment? Will it use the green paper redefinition of long-term, which is more than 18 months unemployment?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, has informed me of the factual position. According to the ABS, in December 1993 there were 344,300 persons unemployed for more that 12 months. Although long-term unemployment is likely to respond slowly to employment growth, the government does not believe that the ABS long-term numbers will reach the suggested 500,000 that was in a recent Canberra article. Since August last year, 123,000 new jobs have been created. Over the 12 months to December 1993, 188,000 new jobs were created. We accept that this is in the short-term area, and that long-term unemployment is the slowest area to respond to the growth in the economy. However, we do not accept some of the alarmist stories that have been reported recently in the press.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the definition of long-term unemployment moving from 12 months to 18 months, as is mentioned in the green paper on unemployment, Senator Kernot would know that that paper is now before the government for cabinet consideration. Mr Crean has already indicated that that paper is before the community for consultation so that the government can receive submissions on such issues as long-term unemployment. If there is to be any change in the definition, or if it is to be left as it is, that will be announced at an appropriate time in the near future when the government responds to the report. I have no information that there is any specific plan before the government at the moment to take up that suggestion to change the definition. We await that consultation with the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do understand Senator Foreman's concern about this issue, as he is from South Australia. Dr Armitage did make a statement in the South Australian parliament yesterday&mdash;I am somewhat at a loss to understand how he could have made it&mdash;attacking the Commonwealth government and alleging that the Maralinga Tjarutja people have been completely excluded from the Maralinga test site clean-up. The claim is totally without foundation. In fact, no contracts for the clean-up site have been let and we are not even close to letting contracts. So nobody has been excluded from this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only hope that the South Australian minister's comments stem from a genuine misunderstanding and not from mischief. Following this government's acceptance in principle of a 20 million pounds ex-gratia payment offered by Britain as a full settlement of the Maralinga issue, my predecessor, Mr Simon Crean, established the Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee to advise on technical aspects of the clean-up and how to proceed with it. The South Australian government is a member of that body. The clean-up is essentially a very large earth moving and engineering exercise. The government intends to appoint a project manager to supervise the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the project manager is to complete the detailed engineering design, to develop a schedule and budget for the program and to tender out the works to complete the program. As I said before, we have not appointed a manager yet but are still at the stage of selecting that person. We will probably be able to make a decision by April. So we are not at the stage of awarding contracts for any specific tasks. No one has been excluded from anything, and the South Australian government, because of its direct formal role in this process, should be well aware of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of project manager was advertised publicly in the national press last September. Thirty six organisations expressed an interest in doing the job and a short list of three has been made. All potential project managers have been informed that, in their planning, they will need to be aware of the views of the Maralinga Tjarutja Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the agreement was reached with the British government in June last year, there has been regular ministerial and departmental contact with the Maralinga Tjarutja representatives in relation to the clean-up. At no time has the government sought to exclude the Aboriginal people from consideration of the clean-up. They were fully involved in considering the clean-up options. Their agreement was sought by the government on the preferred option prior to negotiations with the British government on a clean-up settlement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we do adhere to the convention. I do not have any knowledge of whether any landmines held in the ADF inventory have ever been modified. It has never been brought to my attention. May I say on the general issue of landmines that Australia does share some of the concern that is expressed at the moment over the use of landmines, and particularly the irresponsible use of anti-personnel mines in Afghanistan and Cambodia&mdash;and in many other parts of the globe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these sorts of recent internal conflicts anti-personnel landmines have been used indiscriminately in civilian areas and left unexploded at the end of hostilities, their locations unmarked and unrecorded, and causing unacceptable civilian casualties. The deliberate targeting of landmines at civilians or the indiscriminate use of landmines so that they injure civilians, contravenes fundamental principles of law of armed conflict and should be effectively banned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a party to the 1980 inhumane weapons convention which imposes limited restrictions on the use of mines. We want to see more countries become party to the convention and we have been making representations to our regional neighbours urging them to accede to or ratify it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also been at the forefront of calls for a review conference to strengthen the convention. We will participate in meetings of a group of experts commencing in March 1994 to consider possible amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems of landmines being targeted at civilians or left unexploded at the end of hostilities may be addressed by measures short of a total ban on the use of landmines. They include the effective marking and recording of mined areas, the use of self-neutralising or self-destructing mines, the use of detectable materials and verification and compliance mechanisms, and an extension of the convention to internal conflicts. Our view is that the convention should also contain restrictions on the production and sale of landmines which have the effect of enforcing the other provisions by only permitting the sale to countries which use mines in accordance with the strictest rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not a producer or an exporter of landmines, but we support those countries which have imposed a moratorium on the sale of mines to states which are not party to the inhumane weapons convention. Unfortunately, landmines are relatively easy to produce and therefore a moratorium will not completely solve the problem, which is why we seek a wider accession to, and compliance with, the convention.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most enduring . . . of John Dawkins' reforms of tertiary education has been the creation of the sector as a vigorous exporter of high value services.</PARA>
<PARA>To amplify that, in 1986 Australia earned only $50 million from educational exports. As a result of the reforms to tertiary education introduced by this government, the education industry earned $1.2 billion in 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that step, the government has decided to substantially increase its commitment to promoting international education and training through the establishment of the Australian international education foundation. This is to be a genuine industry and government partnership, with an expenditure of over $18 million over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, government to government liaison is playing an increasingly important role in developing opportunities for Australia's education and training services. The governments in the region have signalled that they want the Australian government to take a stronger role to integrate education and training with broader issues of regional economic development and foreign relations. The foundation will undertake market research and intelligence to guide Australian education and training providers, and facilitate access of Australian providers to key markets.

The previous figures, or the other figures that he has quoted from time to time&mdash;and he is just muckraking again because he has been over this a dozen times before&mdash;were unaudited figures and do not represent a proper assessment by a firm of independent auditors of the kind that was finally produced for the year ending 30 June 1991; that is, the audited figures from Peat Marwick.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that I made the other day I make again for the record: the amount in question is, in a sense, not really to be construed as a loan at all because it is wholly payable at the discretion of the directors of the company concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we have to do better than that. As Senator Lees would be aware, from first getting the job I was anxious to convince the states that we needed nationally consistent data on waiting lists so that at least we would know how many people were on them and how long they were waiting. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has been working with the states, particularly over the last few months, to try to standardise that data. A report will be released towards the end of this year which I hope will give us much more information so that we can determine what appropriate times are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, the estimates I have received are that there are between 103,000 and 112,000 people around the country on waiting lists at the moment for so-called elective surgery. That is less than three per cent of Australian hospital admissions, which are about four million annually, and translates roughly into a couple of weeks of hospital throughput, which is not much. But when it comes to looking at those 103,000 to 112,000 people and how long they wait, we see that approximately one-third of the patients wait for less than a month. So approximately one-third move in and out of the hospital system very quickly. At the other end of that scale, another one-third have been waiting for more than six months. For those people, specialties such as ENT, some general surgery applications and orthopaedics are heavily represented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the report shows; it is a fact. What we then have to work out is whether it is two years, one year, six months or whatever. The only way we are going to be able to do that is to look at what is clinically appropriate in each instance. I am not sure that what is clinically appropriate is going to be translatable into a general charter. Certainly, there ought to be some sort of minimum guarantee to all patients in the public system. So I would like to do that. Of course, that also begs the question that we will need a proper definition of `elective surgery'. I am not sure that we have ever had that, either.</PARA></TALK.START>

Most of the states would be happy to do that provided it is workable and we can translate it from clinically appropriate times for whatever conditions people are waiting for.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As leave has not been granted, I will read it into the record. In order that the position is clear, let me recapitulate my understanding of the events. Following receipt of the Conroy report on the Australian Customs Service, the Minister for Science and Small Business had discussions with the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Kelly. As Senator Schacht has said, after these discussions Mr Kelly agreed to stand down from the position of Comptroller-General. Mr Kelly expressed his interest in moving to another position within government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister acknowledged that Mr Kelly did have expertise which may provide opportunities for him elsewhere in the Australian Public Service&mdash;for example, in providing advice to the government on issues related to regional trade liberalisation, including the outcomes of APEC. The Minister for Science and Small Business referred Mr Kelly to the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and to the Public Service Commissioner for discussion of the terms of his separation from the position of Comptroller-General. The minister also informed the secretary to my department of the suggestion of work on APEC. The secretary responded that this would be a worthwhile project for an officer of Mr Kelly's seniority and background, given the importance APEC ministers had assigned to work on customs harmonisation, and subsequently developed a proposal which was agreed by the minister and Mr Kelly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following consultation with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commissioner, and approval by the Minister for Science and Small Business, the secretary to my department informed Mr Kelly on 4 February that, although his resignation as Comptroller-General of Customs would have the effect, in the formal sense, of his reverting to his substantive Public Service level, the Commonwealth wished to continue to employ him as a special adviser until the end of 1995, on equivalent terms and conditions to those he had had as Comptroller-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 February, the Public Service Commissioner agreed that a personal rate of pay determination for Mr Kelly was an appropriate course of action in this case and executed the determination which enabled Mr Kelly to be paid salary at the same rate as the salary he had been receiving as Comptroller-General of Customs. In other words, proper procedure was followed in determining a salary for Mr Kelly for a fixed and finite period appropriate to the role of special adviser and acceptable to both the government and Mr Kelly in the context of his resignation from Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position has been put by some honourable senators that, instead, the government should have dismissed Mr Kelly. In line with what the Minister for Science and Small Business has said here before, I make the following key points about that: even if the government had been so minded, Mr Kelly, as Comptroller-General of Customs, was a statutory office holder and the grounds for dismissal by the parliament and the Governor-General under the Customs Administration Act 1985 did not exist. Even if, theoretically, this had happened, Mr Kelly would have reverted in any event to a Public Service position at deputy secretary level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's conduct in this matter provides the opportunity for new senior management in Customs, while at the same time treating Mr Kelly in a way that is fair and allowing his experience to be drawn on in an important project of benefit to the government and to the country.</PARA>

As such, it was separate from the grants considered under the community cultural, recreation and sports facilities program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell also asked me to confirm when the $250,000 allocated for the program was announced. As I indicated yesterday, the grant was announced at the same time as all other Western Australian grants in November 1992. Senator Campbell also asked me whether the Minister for Finance or the Prime Minister had knowledge or approval of the $750,000 specifically referred to. The $750,000 was allocated in the 1993-94 budget and therefore went through the normal budgetary processes, which obviously involved both the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was also asked a question by Senator Knowles. I gave an undertaking to provide further information as to why the South Fremantle Football Club requested a $4,000 grant and was given $50,000. Mrs Kelly has provided me with the following information: the House of Representatives Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts has already received a response from the department concerning this grant. I understand the response was given to the committee on 23 December last year and was authorised for publication by the committee. Clearly Senator Knowles should have researched this better before raising it here. She would have then known that the South Fremantle Football Club actually requested $64,000, not $4,000. The project was to light the oval to enable night use of the ground. It was a worthwhile project and met the needs-based criteria applied by the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hill this day, relating to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of question time on 22 February 1994 and tax increases.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister, in his answer to the supplementary to the first question, and in order to explain the inconsistency between the proof and the pink of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, said that in fact he did say, `That wasn't the government promise. It was the burden of taxes'. It was to that that I responded that he lied. You made me withdraw it, Mr President, but I responded in those terms because all of us who heard his interjection yesterday know that that simply was not so. He knows it too, because he was highly embarrassed by his interjection. Let me explain. What was occurring was that Senator Kemp had raised a point of order. Senator Kemp's point of order was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question was very clear and specific: whether the government would stick by its promise not to introduce any new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister got ahead of himself and interjected, `That wasn't the government promise'. Of course he was highly embarrassed by it; everybody laughed, and that was basically what happened. Senator Evans had to turn around and admonish him, and that was the end of that matter. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen! It was so recorded, and appeared in the pink in those terms. In the proof of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> apparently the words, `It was the burden of taxes' were added immediately following what he had said; that is, `That wasn't the government promise'. Then `It was the burden of taxes' appears, which was the explanation that Minister Evans was seeking to make. But that sequence of interjections simply did not occur in that way. Minister Cook knows it, and Minister Evans knows it; and I think anyone who was close to Senator Cook knows that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now learnt during the course of question time that the additional words were added to the proof copy by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because they had been separately recorded by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff officer who makes the additional notes of interjections. Whether he added those words later, I do not know, because I did not hear that, but if that was recorded by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> officer I am not disputing that he added those words at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as it is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> it is clearly misleading, because that was not the interjection that was made by Senator Cook.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turned around because he had been interrupted in mid-flight by a roar of noise coming across at him.

In other words, he meant, `That is what I am trying to say'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what Senator Cook said today. He said it by way of interjection before I had got back to my feet or before Senator Kemp had got to his feet to continue with his next bit, as I was saying before. There was an interruption. Maybe, ideally, that could have been recorded by a little bracket saying `laughter, uproar, boo-rah from the opposition', as sometimes happens, or `interjections or jeers' in the italicised bracket between the two sentences. Maybe that would have been a better way of recording it, because there was a gap of time, as Senator Cook said. But he definitely used that expression. I was sitting here. I heard him use the expression `burden of taxes'&mdash;it was precisely that sentence or some sentence very much like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the words he used. That was understood as the next relevant interjection to occur in the general hubbub.

Be that as it may, the sequence was accurate, it has been accurately recorded and I endorse what Senator Cook said that it is up to Senator Hill to be a little more gracious than he seems capable of being on this occasion, and acknowledge that he made a mistake&mdash;that he made an outrageous allegation against Senator Cook&mdash;and withdraw and apologise. </PARA>

Regarding Senator Evans's comment, I hope Senator Evans will listen to this because, quite frankly, what he has just said is at the very least the gilding of the lily. Senator Evans might care to listen to this because after the interjection by Senator Cook that is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Senator Kemp picked up further on his point of order, to which Senator Evans came back and, because he was answering my supplementary question, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have said consistently is that we will not be increasing the burden of taxation. That is no doubt what Senator Cook was thinking of a moment ago.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Evans was giving an interpretation of what Senator Cook had not said, and if Senator Cook had made the interjection `It was the burden of taxes' that is now in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at that time, then there would be no earthly reason for Senator Evans to make that statement that Senator Cook no doubt was thinking about that. I ask Senator Evans, when he has the grace eventually to wander back into the chamber or to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, whether he can explain why he made that statement, because it has really just compounded the confusion and concern&mdash;some would say the felony&mdash;that has been committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans was also wrong when, in that supplementary answer yesterday, he said that the government `will not be increasing the burden of taxation'. If by `the burden of taxation' he means the proportion of taxation&mdash;the total taxation take&mdash;to gross domestic product each year, and I am sure he does, on the government's own figures in the budget documents last year, the proportion of tax to GDP goes up each year of the period to 1996-97 that the government has forecast out to. Not only that, but in the mid-year review that was released just a couple of weeks ago, even the 1993-94 figure has been increased. So the budget figures are an under estimate of the degree of increase that we will be seeing in the incidence of taxation over the next four years. There is no doubt that Senator Evans and the government need to come back and make an apology to this Senate for yet another totally misleading and incorrect statement. </PARA>

<PARA>That was the moment of high embarrassment, as we remember, when everyone laughed and Senator Gareth Evans turned around and looked somewhat annoyed at his fellow minister. There was a lot of laughter and so forth. A further clear interjection was picked up from Senator Kemp. He said, `Oh, what a joke'. The minister is then seen mouthing an additional set of words which may well have been, `It was the burden of taxes'. If he said that, it was clearly an afterthought. It was clearly in response to the interruption and, in particular, to the further interjection of Senator Kemp that was not recorded. What that all means, when we put the picture together, is that Senator Cook did mislead the Senate today when he indicated to the Senate that his interjection was as appeared in the proof copy and not in the pink. In fact, it would have been accurate for him to say, `As it was in the pink was correct, then there were further interjections, particularly from Senator Kemp, and I added a few words as an afterthought'. </PARA>

<PARA>I have to say that no matter how much Senator Richardson wants to bully his way out of this exercise, and tell me that I should have done further research into this answer that was given to the House of Representatives committee last November, it does not alter the situation one jot. The fact of the matter is that here are 42 pages of the applications for government grants under the sports rorts system. Page 6 refers to the South Fremantle Football Club, registration No. WAU/4/037. It gives a total project cost of $128,000 and states that the grant sought was $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another document that has been provided refers to the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program 1992-93 and it lists the grants that were given. This document, yet again provided by the government, says that the South Fremantle Football Club was given $50,000. I am quite happy to believe that the South Fremantle Football Club realised it had made an error when it put in its original request. But at no stage does this government or this minister have any accountability, whatsoever, of where that second lodgment is. Why does it not provide the documentation? I challenge it to provide the documentation on the basis on which it increased this grant by $46,000. It is not by the opposition or the pixies at the bottom of the garden; it is by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson, as I say, can bully his way through anything. But the fact of the matter is that these documents, to which I refer today, have actually come from Minister Kelly's office. If these documents are wrong, I challenge the minister to tell me where the right ones are. I can tell the Senate that there are other grants on this list that have been given that are not on the lists of requests. Three grants that have been given are not on the lists of requests&mdash;one for $10,000; one for $50,000; and another for $10,000. These do not even appear here.

<PARA>The reason for my asking that question today was brought about by a response that Senator Cook made on 21 February in answering my interjection. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was there a legal obligation to employ him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to Mr Frank Kelly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at that salary?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook's response on 21 February was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a legal obligation to recognise the rights of a statutory office holder.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to my question today, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I am not saying that, and I did not say it at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>And that raises the question, is Mr Kelly's appointment as an adviser to DITARD in line with his legal entitlements or is his salary level of $126,760 above his legal entitlement, meaning that he has been given a special deal? Senator Schacht, in answer to one of my questions on 9 February, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This appointment was made in accordance with the procedures and rules laid down by the Public Service Act, and there is nothing untoward about it.</PARA>
<PARA>In taking note on the same day, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think people opposite should get too carried away about the fact that Mr Kelly has gone to this position. He would have been entitled to be paid a substantial amount of money on the unattached list.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Schacht's answers are right. There is nothing legally untoward about a determination being issued under section 82D of the Public Service Act so that Mr Kelly can continue to get $126,760 a year. The question is whether the government was obliged to issue this determination. I believe the answer is no. Under part 4 of the Public Service Act, which relates to mobility, when Mr Kelly took up the position of  Comptroller-General he became unattached at his substantive level which was that of Deputy Comptroller-General, only an SES band 3 position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is also one of morality and rewarding public servants who could be seen to be incompetent. If the government does not have a legal obligation to pay Mr Kelly any more than the maximum basic salary of around $102,000, why go to the trouble of issuing a section 82D determination to raise his salary to $126,760? Was this part of the deal to induce Mr Kelly to resign as Comptroller-General because, as we all know, the only way to sack him is by a vote of both houses of parliament. This raises a second question of when this adviser's position was created and was it created especially for Mr Kelly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 February, Senator Schacht said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After discussion with Mr Kelly, he agreed to stand down from that position but he made the decision . . . not to resign from the Public Service. Therefore, when he stood down, whatever position he may or may not have been appointed to by me, he would have been unattached at a senior level of the Public Service, even if we had not given him a job to do.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, on 10 February, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of the APEC meeting in Seattle late last year, there was an agreement between all of the participating nations in APEC that we would set up committees to work towards the harmonising of standards, particularly of customs standards and practices . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, there was obviously an identifiable need for an expert in this field and, as a result, when Mr Kelly became available, the department appointed him to that position . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not a position created especially for any individual. It was a position thrown up by the needs of this country . . . it is a position for which very few people have qualifications, and Mr Kelly is one of those very few people who is appropriately available. </PARA>
<PARA>So, I ask, when exactly was this position created? Senator Cook stated that the need for this position was identified following the APEC summit in November and it was not created especially for any individual. </PARA>
<PARA>But Senator Schacht said, `Whatever position he may or may not have been appointed to by me'. He also said, `Even if we had not given him a job'. Either this position was identified and created with a view to gazetting or advertising it, or it was created as a result of the consultations which took place before Mr Kelly's resignation. It would be an incredible coincidence if the position was created, nothing was done to fill it, and then miraculously Mr Kelly resigns from Customs and Senator Schacht appoints him. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans gave the usual abusive answer, and none of the minister's continual pattern of personal abuse of me will prevent me from seeking the truth about the Prime Minister's piggery half-ownership. I want to say that I do not deal in false accusations or unsubstantiated muck. I deal in accounts that have been filed at the Australian Securities Commission which Senator Evans is either unable to understand or refuses to admit are factual, despite the fact that I have tabled them  in  this  place.  There  is  no  excuse for Senator Evans's disgraceful behaviour today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These accounts, from which Senator Evans very selectively quoted today, show $2.76 million that he claims as the outstanding debt to John Brown by the Prime Minister's piggery company. The facts are that those accounts also show that $662,650 was applied to pay off that debt to John Brown in 1991 following a similar allocation of $475,000 in 1990. A total of almost $1.1 million was revealed in those accounts which Senator Evans magically was unable to detect when he came to this place and quoted from the accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the potential for conflict of interest, I asked a simple, uncomplicated question, and I will repeat it: are the Australian people entitled to know how the Prime Minister's company's debt, which was shown in its accounts for 1991 lodged with the Australian Securities Commission on 2 December 1992 at $4.45 million, was reduced to the $2.76 million that Senator Evans now admits exists? I was given an inadequate response to my first question which was: has Mr Brown's company actually been paid this $1.8 million difference? That is the essential thing. Has this $1.8 million difference between an admitted debt to Mr Brown and the statement that Senator Evans says is now the debt to Mr Brown been paid or has it not? What happened to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my supplementary question I said that there were clearly some options available. I asked: has this money actually been paid to Mr Brown, is it just a book entry, or has Mr Brown forgiven the $1.8 million of this debt owing to him by the Prime Minister's piggery? We naturally got no answer to a very proper question relating to the level of indebtedness of the Prime Minister to a lobbyist, former colleague and someone who is appointed to government boards. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very proper question relating to the potential for conflict of interest. It was described as unsubstantiated muck, when it is all quoted from ASC documents saying clearly that there was $4.45 million. We simply want to know the facts.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 November 1993 Senator Chris Schacht, the Minister for Science and Small Business, announced government approval for approximately $25M in compensation payments in response to this recommendation. A copy of the Minister's media release is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3The Government establish a dedicated unit within the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office to investigate individual complaints made against Customs. Additional resources should be provided by the Government to establish this unit. It should report to Parliament through the Ombudsman's Annual Report. The Committee considers that the present practice of Customs officers being seconded to the Ombudsman is unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended both that Australian Customs Service (ACS) officers no longer be seconded to the Ombudsman and also that additional resources be provided to the Ombudsman to permit the establishment of a unit dedicated to investigating complaints against the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's office policy is that secondees do not handle complaints about their `home' departments or agencies. That policy applies to ACS staff as it does to staff seconded from any other department or agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's office has, from its inception, entered into secondment arrangements with Commonwealth departments and agencies. Seconded staff from a number of departments and agencies, including the ACS, have made a valuable contribution to the work of the office over the years. Staff who spend time in the office gain an increased appreciation of the principles of administrative review and the operation of the administrative review system which is likely to be of benefit not only to them, but also to their `home' department and its customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration considered the general question of secondments to the Ombudsman's office in the context of its 1992 review of that office's operations. It favoured the continuation of efforts to encourage secondment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the office of the Ombudsman there is already a degree of specialisation in relation to the handling of complaints. Although no one area of the office is exclusively devoted to the investigation of complaints about a single department or agency, one of the investigation teams has a particular responsibility for ACS matters. The office has established a special investigation unit (as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration) to conduct major investigations. The unit has a different purpose and broader focus from that envisaged in Recommendation 3. Where appropriate, however, it would deal with complaints about the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some of the benefits sought by this recommendation are already in place, the Government is unable to provide extra resources to be dedicated to investigation of complaints against the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">64The Government conduct a review into the operation of the Proceeds of Crimes Act to establish whether its application by the Director of Public Prosecutions is consistent with the intention of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation appears to be based on the assumption that the Parliament did not intend the Proceeds of Crimes Act 1987 to be used in non-narcotics related offences. It was always the intention of the legislature that the Proceeds of Crimes Act 1987 apply to all indictable Commonwealth offences and this is reflected in the Second Reading Speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">76Where Cabinet documents are likely to be of importance to intended Commonwealth prosecution proceedings, the Australian Government Solicitor or Director of Public Prosecutions be permitted to access and copy those documents so that adequate legal consideration can be given to their contents and relevance. By this the Committee does not, however, wish to preclude the placing by the Cabinet Office of appropriate restrictions on that access by the Commonwealth prosecuting agencies preventing any wider dissemination of the material so obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cabinet Office, as a matter of course, provides Commonwealth prosecutors with access to requested Cabinet documents relevant to particular prosecutions. This access is provided on a confidential basis, and the procedure was followed in the Midford Paramount case. Should the Director of Public Prosecutions require an appropriately secured copy of a relevant Cabinet document for use in his or her office for a time, the Cabinet Office could provide the copy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is sufficiently met by current procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">77The Cabinet documents pertaining to the Midford case be released into the public domain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances of three of the Cabinet documents having come into the public domain by order of the Magistrates Court, those documents are no longer regarded as being appropriate for the requirement of confidentiality. Other Cabinet documents should be governed by the conventions of confidentiality which apply to those documents and which would make them subject to release to the public only after 30 years, under the provisions of the Archives Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All governments in Australia, both Federal and State, and all nations with a similar system of government observe the convention that confidentiality properly attaches to the deliberations of Ministers in Cabinet. The convention recognises that it is necessary that there be a forum (Cabinet) in which full and frank discussions by Ministers can take place, uninhibited by the need to temper debate to meet sectional interests or media pressures, and in which individual opinions may be expressed freely among  colleagues without public comment and exposure. If this were not so, the effectiveness of the policy making process (and therefore of government) would be significantly impaired. The High Court gave independent confirmation to the importance of the convention of confidentiality for Cabinet deliberations in its 1992 judgement in the Northern Land Council case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further reason for maintaining the confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations is that such confidentiality is necessary for the preservation of the principle of collective responsibility which requires that decisions, once arrived at in Cabinet, be supported by all Ministers whatever their personal views or the arguments they had put forward in Cabinet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) for his response on behalf of the government, being a response to the outstanding recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, report No. 325, regarding the Midford Paramount case. Throughout that two-year inquiry, I was the deputy chairman. I must say I was somewhat ashamed of the treatment by a department of state of individuals and the harassment that followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware that this response arises out of a failed prosecution by the DPP, and that the case was subsequently dropped. Arising from that, and from questions asked in the valuable Senate estimates committee process, the issue was taken up by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which, over a two-year period, examined the matter in great detail. A great majority of the recommendations were accepted by the government. However, the $25 million in compensation was a small price having regard to the suffering of individuals and the loss of the businesses involved. We hope that, because of this particular case and report, such things will never happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers within the departments of state have a great deal of power. The abuse of that power is a matter of concern to this parliament. It is appropriate and significant that we do have these sorts of inquiry mechanisms to act as a check and a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A disturbing feature that has come out of this inquiry arises from certain comments made by the chairman at the time, Mr Punch, when he indicated that Customs' handling of the investigation into the shirt manufacturer was, at best, incompetent or, at worst, conspiratorial and deceitful. Therefore, it came as something of a surprise that when Mr Kelly, the head of Customs, handed in his resignation, he was given another job on the same salary. The feeling in the outside world is that that could never have happened in business. Why should the taxpayers have to pay this price, when there is overwhelming evidence in terms of difficulties, maladministration and incompetence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The participants in this inquiry, particularly those who are the recipients of the benefit, will be ever grateful for the attitude taken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, because without that inquiry this compensation would never have come to hand. I note that Senator Schacht is in the chamber. I would like to pay a tribute to him for the inquiry he instigated and the calibre of the people who were appointed to the committee that made its investigation. I now look forward to the report of that committee in the long term, and to the government acting on those recommendations. </PARA>

The government's supplementary response to the outstanding recommendations of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Midford Paramount case has now been tabled. There is still one recommendation to be dealt with, that is,  the joint committee's recommendation that the Comptroller-General of Customs report to it about the positions now held by various officers in Customs who were involved in the Midford case. That is still being dealt with, and a report will be forwarded to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the very near future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a sense of expectation, Senator Harradine, it would be almost anticlimactic for me not to have questions asked because, as one would imagine, a considerable amount of my time and energy as minister with responsibility for Customs is being taken up in handling the aftermath of Midford and the recommendations of the Conroy review. For example, since the report of the review was tabled just over two weeks ago, I have had meetings with SES level staff of Customs here in Canberra. I met all the state collectors, as they are called.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week I have also attended meetings of general staff in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. Some of those meetings were attended by up to 400 or 500 staff members. I have discussed with them the Conroy review and its recommendations. I pointed out to them, as I have to the parliament, that I accept the general thrust of the Conroy review, but I am taking under consideration all specific recommendations. I have also made it clear, not only to senior management of Customs, but right through the service, down to the most lowly position, that I want all of them to participate in a consultative process with management regarding how they respond to the thrust of the Conroy recommendations. I have said to them, as I have said publicly, that we will get major change in the culture of Customs only if it is driven from the bottom up. We will not get the change that I think the parliament desires vis-a-vis the Midford report and so on if it is driven only from the top down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reasonably optimistic, after having these meetings with a total of well over 1,000 staff across four different states, that there is, amongst many of those staff, a real willingness to get on with the job of accepting the need for change and reform in Customs. They may disagree with individual recommendations, as is only natural, but they do understand that there is great concern in the parliament, the government and the community about the performance of Customs with regard to the Midford debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue those consultations and meetings with the general staff. I have already had meetings with union representatives in Customs. I have met with representatives of the PSU at both the officials level and the job delegate level, and those meetings will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have emphasised to senior management of Customs that the consultation process for all staff is to be open, transparent and vigorous and that there is to be no sense of people not being encouraged or feeling inclined to censor themselves at the officer level about their contribution and comment in response to the Conroy review. I believe that if that takes place, it will be the first step towards getting a culture change in Customs so that staff at all levels throughout the organisation will have a sense of participation in and constructive contribution to the management and a sense of ownership about the changed process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate Senator Watson's kind remarks about the review committee. I think it was a very well-balanced committee in relation to the background of the people involved and that is reflected in the report. Even if we might not accept every one of the committee's recommendations, the thrust of the report is in the right area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I get the considered responses from Customs and other government departments and prepare a submission&mdash;I hope I will be able to do that within six to eight weeks&mdash;I will take it to cabinet to get authority on the way we will restructure Customs and deal with those issues. Therefore, I will be able to make an appropriate statement at that time which will include, I trust, a timetable for dealing with the change in the structure and legislative requirements. It is quite clear that, if we make any move to change the structure of Customs, it will require legislative action. I am aware, as are other honourable senators, of the very heavy government business agenda over this year, but I hope that legislation can be introduced this year to give effect to the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise again that, whilst I have not yet accepted or rejected any of the specific recommendations, I do accept the general thrust of them. So far, I have been more than encouraged by the response of the staff of Customs. Though they have many concerns about some of the recommendations, they understand the need for change and want to get on with the job of being a top-class service to the Australian public. I appreciate Senator Watson's remarks. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7 April 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hon. Paul Keating,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canberra. A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Keating,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's Action Alliance would like to extend to you and to all in the government congratulations on your success in the recent election and best wishes for a fruitful term ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also congratulate you on converting the Dependent Spouse Rebate to a direct payment to women who are caring for children at home. Women's Action Alliance has called for this measure since our inception in 1975 because in your own words it will "recognize the important role played by women who choose to stay at home while their children are growing up". This is an important breakthrough for-those women because for too long they have been defined as out of the `workforce' when in fact they are performing vital work in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ending of the reduced level of fee relief which applied to occasional care is also welcome as it disadvantaged those women not employed in paid work&mdash;in many cases the very women who could least afford the higher fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the DSR was introduced as a recognition of the living costs of the non earning spouse. It was never intended as a child care payment. The one income family incurs child care costs these being the totality of its foregone second income. Women in the paid workforce are not required to surrender their tax free threshold to become eligible for the new child care rebates but women at home have virtually had their DSR removed in order to fund the Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate, too, that the increase of $150 in the Dependent Spouse Rebate, now to be called the Home Child Care Allowance, compares so unfavourably with the assistance extended to women in paid work via child care fee relief and the new cash rebate. We understand that, under the new arrangements, it will be possible for a mother with two pre-school children in care to receive up to $63 per week extra no matter how high her income while a mother at home caring for her two pre-schoolers will receive only $2.88 per week extra no matter how low her income. Can you confirm that this is the case?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the new child care rebate is to have no means test at all why is it that the Home Child Care Allowance is to have one applied at a level as low as $282? These features of the child care funding arrangements seem divisive and do not sit easily with the concept of One Nation and Labor's ongoing `quest for social equity' of which you spoke in the policy speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr. Staples when introducing the review of the government's Children's Services Program last year said that the primary objective of the program was to "support labour market participation by parents with young children" and in your policy speech at Bankstown prior to the election you referred to women's participation in the workforce being required for the future growth of the economy and to maintain living standards. Women's Action Alliance feels that the primary objective of child care programs should have something to do with the welfare of children and fears that little children will become the pawns in the service of the economy and of employers' labour requirements instead of being given stability and the best possible care which, we are sure you would agree, is provided by their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely our standard of living has dropped if it requires one and a half or two incomes to feed and clothe a family and service a mortgage today while our parents were able to manage on the income from one 40 hour per week job. This change has meant that an increasing number of women have had little choice about their lifestyles and have been denied the choice to be with their children full time in their early years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government spends large amounts to enable other dependent people such as the elderly and the physically and mentally disabled to be cared for at home. It would therefore seem illogical to heavily subsidize the transfer of young children from home to substitute care especially when the best research available from the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that 62% of parents of preschoolers would prefer the mother to be at home full time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's Action Alliance believes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The Home Child Care Allowance should be increased to a level where it equates the tax advantage gained by having access to two tax free thresholds. Currently this would mean increasing the previous DSR level by $640 pa. rather than by $150 pa. In the long term all workers, paid and unpaid should receive a tax free threshold in their own right and child care payments should become a separate item.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The means testing of the Home Child Care' Allowance in the hands of the dependent spouse at $282.00.pa. should be abolished in line with the absence of a means test on the new child care rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The new Child Care Rebate payable to women in paid work should be means tested and the funds thus saved be equitably distributed to all families with children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.While the Home Child Care Allowance retains some of the functions of the old DSR it should continue to be paid out via the tax system as it is in fact a tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not special treatment that we seek for women at home but merely equal treatment so that the aim of the National Agenda for Women to offer women a choice, a say and a fair go will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary could you please answer the following queries for us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Do you agree with Mr. Staples' statement regarding the primary objective of the Children's Services Program?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Could you please explain the rationale behind the disparity between the funding support to parental child care as compared with alternative care.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Brian Harradine,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GPO Box 8961,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOBART TAS. 7001</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill has now passed through the House of Representatives and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two accompanying letters which we have sent to the Prime Minister and other Federal Members, plus our recent submission to the Australian Law Reform Commission, cover most of our concerns regarding the proposed Home Child Care Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having read the Bill, we believe that the "ordinary income free area" (Page 11, Division 5, Section 927) should be raised to the level of the tax free threshold. Failing this, it should at least be indexed. This level has not been raised for many years and allows a current Dependent Spouse Rebate recipient the magnificent sum of $5. 40 income per week before the rebate starts to cut out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ideally, for equity reasons, we believe that the Home Child Care Allowance should not be means tested, as is the case with the new Child Care Rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is considerable discrimination in the handling of women's choice in the Home Child Care Allowance, compared with the new Child Care Rebates. We believe the following matters need to be addressed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Gross disparity in the level of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Means testing of the Home Child Care Allowance in the hands of the recipient&mdash;no means test of the Child Care Rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)Discrimination in the method of payment. The Home Child Care Allowance to be paid as a welfare payment&mdash;the Child Care Rebate to be paid via the Children's Services Program and redeemable at Medicare Offices. (This is insulting to women in the unpaid workforce and makes the allowance vulnerable to means or assets testing at the whim of Governments).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The A.C.T.U. at its most recent National Convention adopted a policy that the Home Child Care Allowance should increase in amount with the number of dependent children. This too would be consistent with the arrangements for the Child Care Rebates as those using non parental outside child care can qualify for a rebate of up to $28 for one child and $61 for two, whereas Home Child Care Allowance recipients will receive only $30 per week no matter how many children they are caring for. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enclosed material will at least provide some ideas that you may think worth including in the debate, as the Government certainly needs to be challenged to explain why it treats one type of family so shabbily, while treating another so handsomely when it comes to supporting the model of child care they choose. In its rhetoric surrounding International Year of the Family, the Government purports not to favour one family model over another, yet here we see actions which fairly blatantly contradict that claim.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also sorry that the Australian Democrats are not here because I think it is important for them to understand what is happening with this particular measure, particularly in relation to some of what I believe to be the unintended consequences. Before I get on to them, I wish to give the chamber an example of how this measure discriminates against mothers&mdash;or fathers, for that matter&mdash;caring for their children at home compared with those who put their children into institutional care. The Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill will result in the following: as we know, under the Child Care Rebate Bill, which was presented to the parliament by the government, a double income couple with each partner on $20,000 per year with two children in child care get $61.20 per week through the child-care cash rebate scheme plus the low income rebate of $150 each&mdash;that is, a family on $40,000 is getting $300 per annum plus $61.20 per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should compare that with what the government is doing in the case of families where one parent is caring for a child or children at home. A one income family on $25,000&mdash;$15,000 per year less than the family I have just described&mdash;with two children at home gets no low income rebate to offset the indirect tax increases and gets a mere $2.60 per week towards caring for its children. How can that be justified? That is a clear case of discrimination against such a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A family with two incomes&mdash;a family on $40,000 a year&mdash;can receive an extra $300 per annum with the low income tax rebate plus $61.20 a week while a one income family on $25,000 a year&mdash;$15,000 less&mdash;with the same number of children is discriminated against. That family receives no low income rebate and a mere $2.60 a week. I want the Democrats to hear that. Can they justify it? How can the government justify that sort of discrimination? It is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are consequences&mdash;probably unintended&mdash;to this bill which need to be looked at. In fact, they constitute the reason for this legislation needing amendment. To begin with, the home child-care allowance will not be available where a child is a student over 16 or living outside Australia. That has been pointed out by other speakers in the debate here and by Mr Ruddock in the House of Representatives. Since the existing dependent spouse rebate is available in all of those cases, families will be worse off as a result of this measure. Did the government realise that? If it did, it did not tell those families&mdash;certainly not before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a family has a student child on Austudy, it receives the spouse rebate of $1,425. Why should it now lose $237 by being cut from HCCA down to the spouse rebate rate payable to a childless couple? Does a child cost $237 less once it becomes a student? Do the parents of that child pay less in indirect taxes in respect of the food and services purchased? At the moment, couples with student children up to the age of 25 get a spouse rebate of $1,425. With this bill, they are denied the home child-care allowance once the last child is over 16 and leaves school or turns 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago&mdash;I hope the Democrats are listening because they will see how unjust this is&mdash;the government abolished the dole for 16-year-olds on the basis that their parents, not the taxpayers, should look after them. Now it is saying that those children do not even exist for the purposes of a home child-care allowance. However, should parents kick their child out because they are too broke to pay the bills any more, the government will fork out the young homeless allowance. So much for looking after families, so much for care; that is what this bill does. In those respects, it is a no care bill. While I hope that those consequences are unintended, amendments need to be made to overcome them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been mentioned in this debate, it is quite common for Australians to be posted overseas for a period while remaining legal residents of Australia and paying full Australian taxes. The examples are endless: diplomats, soldiers, business people, and missionaries. At the moment, they receive the higher level of this spouse rebate of $1,425 where there are children. Now they will have $237 ripped off them. Why is that? The government has not explained it. Why is it that a family cannot go overseas for more than 13 weeks? Why is it that a family cannot leave a child overseas with a relative for a few months to complete a year of schooling while the rest of the family, in the case of diplomatic service, returns from a posting to Australia? What legitimate reason does the government have for using this measure&mdash;the so-called home child care&mdash;to rip off those families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance is not really $1,560, as the government has suggested. The dependent spouse rebate, which remains for childless couples, is $1,188. The existing dependent spouse rebate for those with children is $1,425. So the net increase is a mere $135&mdash;$2.60 a week. I correct what I said before lunch. Before lunch it was $2.85, so it has gone down by 25c to a mere $2.60 per week. That is an insult. Most women&mdash;or men&mdash;at home are staggered to know that the government thinks they are worth only an extra $2.60 a week for raising the Treasury's future taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out the inconsistencies contained in this measure&mdash;the discrimination meted out to parents who are caring for their families at home. Other low income earners receive a $150 rebate to compensate for the indirect tax increases announced in last year's budget; dependent spouses get nothing. I want the Democrats to understand that. The $135 so-called increase is really a decrease when one allows for the increased indirect tax burden on one income families. The home child-care allowance does not allow for the number of dependent children, unlike the child care rebate scheme which increases to a maximum $61.20 for two or more children. Any logical system of child-care assistance should increase according to the number of dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill should be revised and revamped. If we are to have justice, the home child-care allowance should be calculated by adding the low income rebate of $150 to the basic spouse rebate of $1,188, giving a basic amount of $1,388 per annum, and to that should be added the sum of $30 per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not proposing to push that by way of amendment. However, I believe that some of the anomalies that have been pointed out should be subject to amendment. Once this legislation is put into effect, workers are going to be knocked off. Workers will think, in effect, that their wage rates have been cut. Then a cheque will come in the post to parents who are caring for their children at home. They will work it out. They will say, `We are worth $2.60, and it is from the Department of Social Security'. That amount is going to be targeted in future because in this bill the means test is much harsher than it is in respect of the dependent spouse rebate. That is another anomaly that needs to be attended to. All of these matters need to have proper examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny that there is a need to make sure that the money gets into the pocket of the carer. That was my view as well in respect of the tax concession for children, but we have seen what happened to that. Unfortunately, it has been eroded over time, and I believe the same could well occur in this case. The amount has to be adjusted realistically. This discrimination against parents who care for their children at home must be reversed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I want to make a few remarks about the position that the Australian Democrats have taken on the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill. The Democrats have refused to support the coalition's sensible approach to handling the anomalies which have already been brought to our attention. Senator Harradine has in some detail gone over some of those anomalies. From what he has said, I am sure he would support our move to delay the committee stage of this bill so that some of the anomalies that have already come to light can be dealt with by way of amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today Senator Patterson moved an amendment to delay consideration of the bill in the committee stage until these anomalies can be dealt with by way of amendment. The Democrats have said it is urgent that the bill be passed today. However, we can see no reason why this should happen. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The start-up date of the legislation will not be until September 1994, so there is a great deal of time for the legislature to deal with the anomalies. We have already raised quite a number of the anomalies about which we are all concerned. One would think that the Democrats and the Greens in particular would have some specific concerns about some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts are listening to this debate, even though I would not want to inflict myself too heavily on them. Groups such as World Vision, with which I am sure the Greens and the Democrats would have some empathy, have already raised concerns about the impact this bill will have on their aid workers overseas who work for the good of humanity. As Senator Harradine has said, they will be very badly affected by the provisions of this bill. Parents who work for a range of international aid organisations will be badly affected by the provisions of this home child-care bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individuals who work for Care Australia and other good Australian and international aid organisations that provide assistance, particularly in Third World countries, and who commit their lives and time, often for relatively low amounts of remuneration, will be affected by the provisions of this bill. That is only one area that certainly needs to be addressed by amendments. I cannot see why the Democrats&mdash;and I presume the Greens&mdash;are so keen to see this bill pushed through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention the approach that Senator Denman took in this debate. I think Senator Harradine has already raised what a sick and sad joke this $2.60 a week support is for home child carers. When doorknocking during the last federal election, I took a particular interest in the electorate of Canning&mdash;an area in which a lot of average Australians are struggling to look after their children. I would see 100 people a day while doorknocking and one of the issues that came up all the time was assistance to single income families with children. I was told that all of the assistance went to people who had two incomes&mdash;and, of course, people who have two incomes are better off financially. Clearly, this would have been shown in the polling that the government had conducted. Of course, the promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his election speech of $30 assistance to people at home had a tremendous electoral impact. It really was an election gimmick. But sadly, like just about every other promise made during that election campaign, one had to read the fine print. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating is still the Prime Minister at the next election and Mr Crean has not knifed him in the back and taken over by then, which I am sure is what he intends doing&mdash;and I predict that Mr Keating will not be the Prime Minister because he will become so unpopular&mdash;or, indeed, if Mr Crean is the Prime Minister because people like Senator Gareth Evans and Co. back his leadership push, we should insist that the leader of the Labor Party, whoever it is, provides an appendix to the policy speech with all the fine print, all the `cross your fingers stuff' such as the promise of $30 by Mr Keating. But people will not get $3 or even, as Senator Denman said, $6 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden Senator Denman has increased the amount from $5.20 to $6 a fortnight, so we had better watch what she says. She has misled the Senate by saying it is $6 a fortnight, so we are being misled again by another Labor Party senator. We can check <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on that. Even that is a sick joke; it is an absolute insult to mothers who stay at home and look after their children. But the reality is, as Senator Harradine said in his speech, that it is actually $2.60 a week. That is the value. They were promised $30 a week by the Prime Minister. Electors in marginal seats who were sitting at home watching the television and trying to make up their minds on how to vote would have seen this promise of $30 a week and said, `My God, the government has finally recognised the value of my work. They will give $30 a week in assistance'. But, of course, the reality is, as has been explained over and over again in this debate, that it is $2.60 additional assistance. As Senator Harradine and a number of other speakers have said, it is far more tightly targeted. All sorts of anomalies arise in relation to people working overseas and people in other sorts of categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth looking at the plight of families on average earnings in terms of the present taxation system. An interesting study carried out by the OECD was reported in the 4 December edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. This study compares the taxation circumstances of two-child families earning, as the OECD calls it, average manufacturing wages. That is a category that would include a lot of average Australians&mdash;the sort of people who will have seen that promise of $30 a week in the Prime Minister's policy speech and who will receive only $2.60 when this bill goes through with the assistance of the Democrats and, possibly, the Greens. They are so keen to see it go through today that they will not even allow some sensible consideration of the bill at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not seek leave to incorporate this table because the quality is probably not good enough for publication in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is fascinating to study an analysis of OECD direct taxes, which we know are high in this country, covering an average two-child family earning average wages. It shows that Australian families suffer some of the highest rates of taxation in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister when on roster in Parliament on Monday&mdash;he has had a couple of RDOs since then&mdash;told members of the other place, and anyone who was listening in, that Australia was a low tax country. And today we had all this debate about the burden of taxation. The burden of taxation as a percentage of GDP is a statistic that actually does not affect the lives of average Australians very much. It certainly does not affect the lives of wealthy people who have investments in things like piggeries and can claim massive depreciation and massive write-offs. It certainly does not affect the lives of those who can invest money for tax free capital gains in things like antique French clocks. But it does affect people who live in suburban Australia, who have a couple of kids and who have only one income. These are the sorts of people whom this study affects and it shows how income tax falls on them in comparison to some of our friends and neighbours around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian families face higher tax rates than families in Norway, Ireland, Italy, Britain, Canada, Belgium, the United States of America, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Japan, Portugal, France and Luxembourg. I reiterate, at the threat of boring the chamber, that this is a study of average families across the world which have two kids and an average manufacturing salary&mdash;the sorts of people who need the most assistance through home care, taxation and social security. The only countries that have higher tax rates on families are&mdash;and this is no surprise&mdash;Denmark, Sweden, Finland and New Zealand. Out of the OECD, four nations beat us. So this is the burden of the tax system falling on these average families. </PARA>

The attitude is, `Let's get the bill through today. Let's not have consideration of sensible amendments.

Here we have a government that has deceived the people and deceived Australian families into voting for the Labor Party&mdash;costing the Liberal-National party coalition the seats of Canning and Swan.

There is absolutely no need for this legislation to be rushed through. There is no need for the committee stage to be dealt with straightaway. We plead for some time to put together some sensible amendments to overcome these anomalies. That will take time. It cannot be done in an afternoon or a night, as was done with the stupid amendments that were put up to the Mabo bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Campbell who gave a very good delivery, considering I agreed to let him go ahead of me if he spoke for only two minutes. I would say that in the six-and-a-half years that I have been in this place, this is definitely the first social security bill that I have ever spoken on; but for the people who think I am softening, a tax bill will come with it later to remove that spouse rebate for those with children. So I feel free to speak on the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I speak for other reasons as well. I do believe that this was a two-card trick during the last election. I can remember Senator Crowley, I think as minister at the time, making a big deal during the election about this $30 that was going to be handed out to carers at home. I used to yell out across the chamber to the honourable senator and say, `Tell us about the spouse rebate with children and how it is going to disappear', but she would never take up my invitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I invite Senator Crowley to explain, when she sums up, why she did not tell us during the election that that was going to be removed as well. We read the fine print somewhere along the line. I do not know how long it took to get through, but I did a lot of doorknocking around the place, as did Senator Campbell&mdash;only I was in the seat of Brand. It was brought up time and again that this government was going to throw around $30&mdash;just like that. There was no mention of taking it off the spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance will replace that dependent spouse rebate, and it is available to couples with children, and at a maximum rate of $1,560 a year&mdash;if I have read it correctly. This will not have an effect on couples with no children. They can still claim the spouse rebate. I hurriedly rang home to check our wages books. The rebate, I believe&mdash;there are other figures quoted&mdash;is $27.10 for a married couple with children, and $22.50 for a married couple with no children. By my calculations it means an extra $2.90 to the child via the social security office. I will come back to that later on. The administration there is going to take away far more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason that I speak in this debate is the effect that it will have on employers, and especially small employers, say with five, six or seven employees. I will explain later why I have used those figures. This is only the bill to set up the mechanism to pay this child-care home allowance. The taxation amendment bill to deal with the levy will come later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was wondering whether the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has given much thought to the fact that a lot of couples with children are quite happy with the present situation. Most of them have never had anything to do with the Department of Social Security or the social security office. A lot of them do not want to have anything to do with it, because when they go around to the social security office they feel as if they are being pushed into the social welfare state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that whatever they did they would be pushed into that situation. As far as I am concerned, the people who have had nothing to do with social security or social welfare will create some problems. I can see problems coming&mdash;Senator Harradine mentioned this on the way through&mdash;for employers with five or seven employees, as I have. Such employers are very close to the employees. As Senator Harradine said, in September&mdash;not the last Saturday in September, an earlier one&mdash;those with children, on my figures, will get $27 a week less. It will not affect those with no children. There is no argument about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people affected will say, `Where is the rest of my wages?' That question will certainly come. I will have to say, `Your wife, or whoever is the carer, will have to go to the social security office and get that'. They will say, `No, I want it from you. I work for you; you should give it to me'. I will say, `No, you have to go down to the social security office'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand will come; they will say, `No, I want it from you'. All I can advise these employees to do is to fill out a spouse rebate form without including children. There is nothing wrong with that. Then they would still get the rebate of $22.50. Then muggins here, to keep the peace in the camp, will have to put the balance in. So there will be a demand in increased wages, and the best that I can make of it will be to make up the difference, which is $5&mdash;less 40 cents&mdash;on my figures. That is the best that I and most employers will be able to get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the other situation. If the wife can go to the social security office and pick up that $30, the employees can and will legitimately say&mdash;and I wish the minister would listen to this because even if the minister does not employ people, others do; and these problems will arise&mdash;`No, the government gave me that. It promised that $30 to me during the election. The government said nothing about taking the spouse rebate away&mdash;that is correct. They will say, `The social security office gave me that $30. That is mine. That is my wife's. You have to give me the same wages'. In that case there will be a demand for increased wages of $27. Most of us who have employed people know that is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hear the minister's explanation on that. If the bill is taken seriously at face value and people do get that extra $2, that is an insult and a joke. I know there will be recipients who are not already in the system and getting it, but they could have been dealt with in a different way. The ones who want to go along with the scheme will accept the fact that they will lose their spouse rebate of $27.10 and the wife will go to the social security office and get $2.90&mdash;and look at the extra amount of administration that will involve, rather than having the employer pick up the administration costs. I believe that the government sold us a pup&mdash;not me, but the rest of the community in Australia&mdash;in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only the bill setting up the scheme. When the tax amendment bill is put into action, and the levy is taken away, the government will have to think very seriously about it. The minister has disappeared again and is not listening; her advisers can probably listen and take the point. I believe that if an employee and his spouse both agree that they want to remain in the same system they should be given the option to do so and still get the spouse and children rebate of $27.10. As I said, I have employees with no children who already get $22.50 and for whom it will remain the same. They have no option. I believe that if the government is dinkum in what it is doing it will give the option to remain as they are to the people who are happy with the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are cases where the husband picks up the pay and he might not pass enough to the wife&mdash;although these days most of the average pay packet goes to keeping the household and there is nothing left over for anything else. I know there are deserving cases. But where the couples are happy with the present situation, if the wife wants to stay away from the social security office and the husband does not particularly want his wife receiving social security, they should be given that option. I want the minister to take that on board. Even though she is not listening, perhaps someone else is.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans might like to comment on his idea when he speaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I question the financial impact that is given in the explanatory memorandum. It says that the estimated total outlays for these measures is $4.25 million in 1993-94&mdash;it seems a bit low to me&mdash;$576.06 million in 1994-95 and $346.49 million in 1995-96. It mentions that the outlay is an extra $230 million in total. I would like the government to explain whether it has allowed for what it will forgo in tax with the spouse rebate to tie these figures up. If not, would it give the total figures? I want to know the balances and the credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other honourable senators, I ask the Democrats and the Greens, who are having a private conversation with the minister, why they think that we cannot wait another week or so to put this bill through. There are plenty of reasons from Senator Harradine, Senator Campbell, Senator Paterson and others who have spoken on this bill as to why we should suspend it for a week. It does not start until September, and there is plenty of time. After all, the tax bill which will provide the money and take away the levy is nowhere in sight. If that had already gone through and we were just waiting for this bill to fire up and get everything going, I would agree. But this bill is useless without the tax amendment bill to come with it. I cannot see that the Democrats have a valid reason&mdash;I do not know what the position is of the Greens&mdash;for not postponing the bill until we can look at it properly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear the criticisms from those opposite regarding this legislation because they are usually haranguing us for the alleged failure to deliver on election promises. But this is in fact the government delivering on the promise we made prior to the election. It is also a further plank in the government's family policies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, it also marks a philosophical change in the approach to providing support for carers of children in non-paid employment.

It is a recognition by society of the importance of that work and the contribution to society of carers and, therefore, it marks an important philosophical change in the approach reflected in this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of the legislation has been adequately canvassed.

The first point I want to make is that the bill will increase the total payments made to families. There has been some suggestion that somehow this measure is revenue neutral. That is just not correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, what we said was that this measure replaces the dependent spouse rebate and provides for an increase in the total payment. The total payment increase quantum has been argued about today. Whether it is $5.90 or $5.60 a fortnight&mdash;I do not really want to get into the semantics of that&mdash;it is not a revenue neutral measure. It is an increase in the payments made to families which we believe will cost the government approximately $230 million per year. So there is a net increase of $230 million a year being paid to families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have found it easy to ridicule the amount of the extra assistance provided. I think that is a cheap shot. But there are a couple of points I want to make about that. Firstly, the day after the election policy announcement it was made very clear what the real increase was. Suggestions by the opposition that somehow this was another lie, that it lost the election because it was all our fault and that we lied, are just a sign of its own inadequacies. It is nothing to do with the GST; it is nothing to do with the opposition's inadequacies; it is because we lied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a nonsense.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can show those opposite all the editorials and all the comment pieces in the newspapers and on the television, after the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the policy, that were very keen to point out that the net increase was more in the order of $5 to $6 a fortnight than a full $30. It was well explained and detailed throughout the election campaign. Those opposite cannot hide behind that argument. I am the first to admit that it would be better if we could afford more&mdash;if we could pay a greater amount. We are saying that this is an incremental increase that is an improvement on the previous situation and that it will increase the total revenue going to families. It is easy to dismiss it and say it is a sleight of hand and ridicule the amount, but the reality is that it is an increase, it is being targeted to families and it is the start of a whole new approach to the way we direct support to those families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was actually quite concerned about the criticisms of the bill raised by the Women's Action Alliance, and I genuinely responded to them. The alliance supported the general thrust of paying the allowance direct to the carer, but raised some concerns, as has been pointed out in the debate, about the approach adopted in the bill. I have satisfied myself that those concerns are not well founded. The mistakes that the Women's Action Alliance made in analysing the bill have been repeated in today's debate by some honourable senators opposite. We have to address some of those concerns and put the whole debate into its proper context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the point about this measure not being revenue neutral and that there is an increase in funds going to families. There is no doubt that we would prefer to do more, but, as I think Senator Lees made the point quite validly, the debate must be held within the constraints of the whole budget process. We need to find a balance between the competing demands on the taxpayers' dollar and the demands of other people in society who require assistance from the government. All those issues have to be taken into account. The other issue that has to be considered is the question of interaction with wage levels and benefit levels. The whole context has to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure also has to be examined in the context of all government programs. There has been a tendency to pull this legislation out and pretend it is the only government program targeted at families and that it can be examined in isolation. This is quite wrong. The government went to the last election with a range of commitments which have been implemented and a range of continuing policies which go to helping families. They are the taxation policies and the tax cuts which we have delivered on: family payments and the family income supplement, rent assistance, Medicare and a whole range of other social wage policies. If we are going to talk about this measure, it has to be in the context of all those other things that have been done for families. We cannot pull out</PARA>
<PARA>one measure and try to argue about the government's family policy without considering all those things that constitute the whole government approach to providing assistance to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I want to address is means testing. There is a superficial appeal in the Liberal Party's argument about means testing on all these issues, but we really have to work through the implications. Senator Harradine made some comments about the replacement of the DSR that do not tally with the information that I have been provided with about the income test that applies. As I understand it, the income test that applies to the DSR has not been changed and it is reflected in the income test that will be applied to the home care allowance. There is no asset test or income test on the employed spouse. There is an income test on the carer. If we think about it, it is only natural that that be the case because the very character of the home child-care allowance is one designed for those caring for children at home and who are not in paid employment. </PARA>

The logic of the whole allowance is that it is an allowance for those not in paid employment and who are not earning income from paid employment. If they work, then the allowance is phased out so that if they are earning a reasonable income or reasonable part-time income, they are no longer eligible for the allowance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Newman stops interrupting, I will do my best. I think the opposition's approach is a nonsense. The two pieces of legislation reflect the Labor Party's support for the reality of Australian family life. There are not competing objectives contained in those two pieces of legislation; they are both supporting choices made by Australian families. On the one hand, the child-care rebate legislation seeks to support families who have made a choice to place their children in child care because both parents are earning an income, undertaking training or searching for a job; and, on the other hand, this legislation seeks to support those families which, for whatever reason, have one of the parents or carers at home not in paid employment. They do not reflect competing objectives, they are not conflicting approaches; they are each supporting choices made by Australian families, choices that are the reality of Australian life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Minchin to say we are pitting mother versus mother and to make those sorts of ludicrous suggestions is really beating up the issue and misrepresenting what is occurring. The reality is that most of the opposition speakers have supported the general approach and they have gone to questions of detail rather than the philosophical approach that underlines our position. Some honourable senators&mdash;and I say only some&mdash;have reflected a view common in the Liberal Party of opposition to the provision of paid child care and the families which choose to use that option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of points in relation to this comparison argument between the child-care rebate and the home care allowance need to be made. First, the debate has to be put in the context of other measures. The taxation regime, the rent assistance, the family payments, the family income supplements, are all measures that go to supporting families depending on their circumstances, and some of them are income related. We have to look at the whole package provided to families by the measures that government provides, not try to pull out these two separate measures and say, `This is how the government treats families. This is the only thing the government does for families. One family is getting $60 a week and one is getting $30'. It is superficial, it is shallow and it is just not right. We cannot make those direct comparisons because it is a much more complicated picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the child-care rebate is just that&mdash;a rebate. It is paid only to families which pay out more than three times the amount of the rebate in child-care fees. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crowley. It is a partial reimbursement for the costs incurred in earning an income. It is not an allowance paid; it is a rebate for costs incurred for those families which have to provide child care when both partners are out earning an income. The home child-care allowance is an allowance paid in recognition of the opportunity costs of people not being able to earn an income by virtue of their caring for dependent children. These are two quite different approaches. As I say, to try to make the argument that they are directly comparable is just not correct. Given the history of the DSR and its evolution, it is just not a fair comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make the point that one of the reasons why the government has adopted a flat amount rather than a per child amount in the payment of the allowance is that it too follows the logic of the allowance. The existing DSR compensates for the opportunity cost of the parent at home at the same rate, whether the parents is caring for one, two, three, four, or however many children. The fact is that that parent is not able to earn an income, and this is in compensation for not being able to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find caring for my one two-year-old more than enough. I would not like to be caring for more children than that. I agree that the costs of caring for and raising more than one child are obviously higher. But the allowance is not a social security payment. It is an allowance made recognising the opportunity costs of the carer's inability to earn income. If people are trying to say that they want a social security measure that addresses the costs of raising children, then that again ought to be adopted or approached through a different avenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think the legislation is a significant step forward in the treatment of these matters. I think it is an important philosophical step that we take and it does start to recognise the role played by carers of children at home who are not able or choose not to go out into the paid work force. This legislation is part of a balanced approach to supporting families and the choices that they are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope there is general support for the philosophical approach adopted in the bill because I have been a bit concerned by some of the comments made during this debate today. I think there have been a number of issues raised in the debate that are worth considering. I do not think that there is any attempt by the government to rush this through. I am sure all parties are willing to examine arguments that go to making sure that we get good legislation. Some of the arguments raised in the debate really reflect the opposition's difficulties in coming to terms with the reality of Australian society. The government's approach in supporting families and their choice of how they raise and care for their children is the appropriate one. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. There has been a great deal of debate on this subject today, and rightly so. It is very important that debate on Australia's families and their needs takes place in the parliament of Australia. I am very glad to hear the previous speaker, Senator Chris Evans, talk about choice. To me, choice is really at the base of the things that we should be doing for families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker was somewhat misguided in how he reads choice. Perhaps choice is in the eye of the beholder. I recognise that these days&mdash;when we educate women to the extent that we do, as compared with past years&mdash;it is a case of how we are going to keep them down on the farm now that they have seen Paris. It is inevitable that women will want to be in the work force. They will want to follow careers when they have had a quality education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also recognise that with the totally unsatisfactory level of marriage breakup these days, it is good financial management, and good career and life planning, for women to maintain the skills that they may have achieved because they will, only too likely, need them to support themselves and perhaps children too in years to come if they are either widowed or their marriage breaks up. Sadly, that is the reality for far too many people. For other women, there is the need to simply keep the heads of their families above financial water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People come from their own perspective in this discussion. Sometimes it is from a comfortable middle-class perspective where they have not seen how hard it is for people coping with poverty. Sometimes people come at it from other perspectives. But, whichever perspective we come from, we must acknowledge that parents deserve the right to choose how they will rear their children. That should not be dictated by unacceptable financial pressures. It should be a real choice, not just a choice in name only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that when the government talks about  choice, it looks at this in a fairly uncaring sort of a way. I do not think it recognises the reality that so many young parents want to have one parent stay home with their children while they are young. Yet those same young parents are saying, `But we cannot afford it. We would be doing it if we could, but the reality is we cannot afford it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate does nothing to enable those parents, who would like to have one parent staying home with their small children, to make that choice. It is simply the cost of a couple of minor grocery items. It is not even the cost of a packet of cigarettes. I am not suggesting that they should go and spend it on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality is that that $2.85 will not do anything for the living standards of the families we are talking about and for whom that second income has become a necessity. Of course, part of the reason it has become a necessity is that the great Australian dream of owning one's home is now so difficult to achieve, especially in some of Australia's cities. Without that second income, it will never be achieved. When a couple have a baby and they are full of joy at the thought of that baby, the next thought that comes into their heads is, `How are we going to cope with the mortgage?'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, they do not always plan as well as Senator Crowley might think they should in a good socialist society. Love comes first and perhaps calculation comes afterwards in a good many families. Maybe it did not come in her's, but it does in plenty of Australian families. But the joy of realising that they are about to become parents can be somewhat tempered, at least, by the reality of how they will survive on one income. All too often young couples with a brand new baby are faced with the reality that they must first of all find child care, then afford child care and then spend the next few years verging on the edge of guilt because they would like to be staying at home with a young baby. As I say, this cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate and turning it into the home child-care allowance will not make the slightest difference to maintaining that mortgage or putting that couple into a different financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people have spoken about the financial position of Australian families today and I want to put a few facts on record. It is true to say that the great majority of Australia's families have suffered worsening economic conditions over the past decade. In 1982-83 the income of the top one per cent of income earners equalled the total earnings of the bottom 11 per cent. But by 1988-89 the top one per cent was earning an amount equal to the total incomes of the bottom 21 per cent. That is something to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work by the Social Policy Research Centre has demonstrated that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been big losers. They have suffered a 20 per cent drop in their share of national income since 1975. Even the research of the Department of Social Security has shown that, since 1983, a single income couple with two children on average weekly earnings is nearly five per cent worse off. Research studies have shown that there is no net assistance from government to families with dependent children. Families with dependent children enjoy a real standard of living about three-fifths of that of the rest of the adult working population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my colleagues have already highlighted how the government policy clearly discriminates against the one income family. I was interjecting on Senator Chris Evans a few minutes ago about that and, clearly, we will not agree. He addressed the issue of means testing. Of course, it is true to say that one is means tested and the other is not. It is also true to say that one pays a maximum of $30 a week and the other pays up to $61.20 a week. He talked about the reality of family life. The reality of family life is that where there are two parents in the work force, there are two tax-free thresholds available to that family&mdash;meaning, in effect, that that family has considerably more disposable income, even when compared with a one income family on a substantially higher income. So the difference in the presence or absence of the tax threshold is one very big reality in the lives of Australia's families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-means tested child-care rebate makes two parents in the workplace&mdash;getting their two tax-free thresholds and their means test free child-care rebate&mdash;a logical option from a financial point of view. So it is not really just a question of what families would like to do; it is a question of where their financial interests lie if they are going to achieve for themselves and their children what they want in life. It is, if you like, government policy driven, not driven by the wishes and personal needs of the family. Sometimes people are doing something because they want to do it; sometimes they are doing it because it really is the only sensible option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, that discrimination shows up in the taxation system as well because single income families pay up to 40 per cent more tax than two-income families earning the same amount. A family earning $50,000 a year from one income pays $13,646 in tax, and a family earning the same amount from two equal incomes would pay $9,593, or $80 a week less&mdash;that is, $80 extra of disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and over again we come back to the question of choice. Until we address that properly, until it is a real choice for families, as a nation we have not done our best by the developing families in our country. We all recognise the need to raise our children in the best way possible for their sakes and for the sake of the future of our country. Where parents would like to have the opportunity of continuing personal contact with their children, watching the developmental stages bit by bit as they grow, responding to their children, stimulating their children, helping in the real development of their children yet are deprived from doing so on purely financial grounds, we have not served Australia's families well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case it should be thought I am looking only at what is a family's income, there is more to it than simply what is the total disposable income. As we all realise only too well when we have raised a family of our own, the one income can be a very different kettle of fish in one family's hands when compared with another family with the same income. I am here talking about the question of dependency&mdash;the question of mouths to feed, shoes to buy, children to raise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This not only applies to children, of course, but also to adult disabled family members, for example, or chronically ill family members and elderly family members who may be dependent upon the younger generation. A family with an income of $40,000 which has two dependants to keep is in a very different position, and as a result their choice is a very different matter from the family with $40,000 which maybe has four, five or six dependants. So when we look at family policy issues, when we are trying to do our best as a nation for Australia's families, we should not only focus on the income available to families but I believe we should also be looking at the question of dependency and the needs of Australia's families as they vary from one to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I would like to make particular mention of some of the families who will be excluded under the government's legislation. Having formerly had the shadow portfolio of defence science and personnel, and knowing only too well how many families in the defence forces must go away from this country for prolonged periods because the nation requires them to do so, I was very alert to the fact that the government has excluded these families from coverage of the home child-care allowance. I find that extraordinary, because in the past those families would have been entitled to the dependent spouse rebate. As I understood it, the government's promise was that these families would simply be exchanging the dependent spouse rebate for the home child-care allowance and would be given the price of a McDonald's hamburger to go with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it seems that some people are less equal than others. Defence Force personnel, public servants, people in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, people from our universities who go overseas to work or to do further study&mdash;some of the top medical people in our country are only as good as they are and are only available to us for our health care because they too have spent prolonged periods overseas acquiring further skills in their profession&mdash;are the people who are excluded under this legislation. I find it quite incredible that the government is bringing to us what purports to be the implementation of an election promise which in fact excludes a number of people who, for no good reason, are being cut out altogether. The very fact that they are overseas for periods of time does not mean to say they are not Australian citizens. They may well be paying Australian taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the dependent spouse rebate had remained, these people would still have been entitled to it. I find it quite incredible that this action is being taken against them. I can only be charitable and suggest that it is an unintended consequence of the government changing this entitlement, but I do urge that action be taken urgently to reinstate the position for these families who are overseas, but not permanently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is currently working, and will be spending a great deal of time during the International Year of the Family, on producing policies which are family friendly in a number of policy areas. We believe one of the most important areas is in this inter-relationship between the taxation system and the social security system; how best to help Australia's families, how best to provide them with real, genuine choices in the life decisions that they make, and how best to help and support them in rearing the next generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, while the opposition is not averse to the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate, and while we recognise that many women's groups have wanted that to happen for a great many years, we are concerned that the government does have such a blinkered vision, shall I say, about the needs of different kinds of families and how unwilling it is to recognise that there are stages in a family's life where it may well wish to be a one-income family if it could afford it, even though it had previously been a two-income family, will probably later become a one-and-a-half income family and will probably eventually end up being a two-income family again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a profile of a pretty typical Australian family. We move in and out of these various stages in our lives. Surely to goodness while we are in the stage of raising the smallest members of our families we should have a real choice of being able to live on one income without being discriminated against as compared with other families which may have both parents in the work force.</PARA>

Senator Chris Evans made a great contribution in trying to make it clear to the opposition that one does not get the $61 child-care cash rebate unless one has spent nearly three times that amount on child-care expenses. That seems to be lost on those opposite. They rush around the place saying, `If you go to work the government will give you $60'. That is not the case until one spends well over two and a half times, nearly three times, the amount.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are a number of arguments that the opposition has put up, but before I deal with them I would like to highlight some of the huge advantages of this bill, because they have been deliberately ignored and not stated in the debate by the opposition. I have said already that this cashing-out gives due recognition for the first time to the valuable work done by the spouse at home in caring for children. Also, it is paying&mdash;albeit a modest amount, one might say&mdash;money directly to that spouse who is now not able to continue earning income in the work force. It is paid straight away. If the person's income is below $10.50&mdash;and we have had the figures spelt out&mdash;up to $250 per fortnight, they are entitled to this payment straight away. They do not have to wait until the end of the tax year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not have to wait to get the benefits. Not everybody is a PAYE taxpayer. Many people do not get access to the dependent spouse rebate until 18 months later. I am advised it is about 50 per cent of people, Senator Panizza. So I am not wrong. I make the point again that immediately those people stop work to have a child, they have access to this cashed-out home child-care allowance, which is of massive benefit. Also, about 55,000 families who have not been eligible for the dependent spouse rebate because their tax liability was so small are now eligible. Nobody in the opposition told us about that great benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no breaking of hearts by those opposite for all those people who have not had the dependent spouse rebate to this point. There was no telling us the facts of the matter as to the huge gain to all those families at the lowest end of the income scale who will now be able to get the home child-care allowance. And what a benefit it will be to them. If those families are ones whose taxable income is not sufficient for them to get the full dependent spouse rebate, then one is, by definition, talking about people with a very modest income, and they, all 55,000 families, as estimated, will now benefit to the full amount of this home child-care allowance. That is a very, very big gain for those families. It is curious that nobody from the opposition wanted to talk about that or put those facts on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the income test for children will be expanded so that it is not $1,785 a year as it is now, but $5,860 a year. That is more than three times as generous as it is now. With regard to those children over 18 years of age, for whom the caring spouse will not qualify for the home child-care allowance, there are not likely to be too many of those children in the category that seems to be one that is upsetting Senator Patterson. I would submit there are very few children over the age of 18 whose income is below what is currently $1,785. </PARA>

He then turns around to talk to any woman who is working&mdash;any woman except a woman who is just a housewife at home. Senator Minchin calls this the housewife syndrome. Why does he not call it the boring man syndrome? It has nothing to do with the poor housewife. This is a disgrace. We have heard of `Blame the victim'; now it is `Label the victim'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin also got the facts about the cash rebate and the home child-care allowance very muddled. He keeps saying it is $30 paid out if the parent is at home and $60 paid out for two children if they are in child care. People do not get $60 unless they spend at least 2 1/2 to nearly three times that amount on child-care expenses in the formal or informal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Senator Minchin, he was appalled that we want to encourage women into the work force with the cash rebate for child care but that we then want to give women only what he called $30 to stay at home. But then he went on to say that of course the opposition would have done it too. So I really do wonder about Senator Minchin's view. Is he for it or against it? Does he somehow think that if the opposition wanted to give a cash rebate for child care it would be all right, but that it is not all right for the government to do so? He then spent a lot of time adding to confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very interested to hear from opposition members on these things because, in all the years that I have been in here, I have never heard them get up to speak about the income test on the dependent spouse rebate.

There is also a suggestion that the cash rebate is just some kind of payment by government and that there is a failure by the opposition to recognise that that is also a milestone in legislation on behalf of women. Another thing for which women have fought for years is the recognition that child-care costs are a legitimate claim against earning an income. This government has recognised the legitimacy of those costs against income and has targeted the payment so that it is most equitable. That is what the cash rebate is about. This is not a war between cash rebate and the home child-care allowance. These are two splendid advantages for women and families of Australia as we recognise that women sometimes choose to be at home and sometimes choose to be in the work force. It is entirely as a result of recognising those options for women that this government has introduced these two benchmark pieces of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to make some comments about Senator Panizza's statement that he could be accused of going soft if he spoke about social security. That is another attitude that is very worrying. I do not judge that anybody who speaks about social security is going soft. I do not believe speaking about social security is a soft option but, unfortunately and sadly, Senator Panizza does. I find that very disappointing. Having said that, I ask what else can one say about anything he has to say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Newman trawled across the same ground, adding nothing new to the arguments. The opposition is very confused about its policies for women, and it is certainly very confused about its policies for families. I suppose I could suggest, somewhat facetiously, that the opposition could form a good little committee to examine family policies. Two first players might be Mr Howard from the other place and Senator Vanstone who, so far as I can read in the public press, are very diametrically opposed to income splitting, tax-free thresholds and so on. But that might be a good thing to start with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite do not want to start with a committee, they at least provide clear evidence of the deep divisions in the opposition about policies for families. They are not agreed about their policies for women because they are very confused. Opposition members are not at all able to say that these are two absolutely great achievements for women, which are therefore achievements for families. They have got themselves so muddled and so caught up on the idea that somehow women at home are at war with women in the work force that they have failed to understand that these policies assist women in making choices. They assist families in moving between having a spouse at home and having two spouses in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to assist the Senate with a couple of figures. First of all, there is a claim that we are spending far too much money through cash rebates for child care and child-care assistance and that this amount is far larger than that which we spend on the home child-care allowance. I will shortly seek leave to incorporate a table which makes comparisons of outlays of programs. It shows quite clearly that, in the year 1994-95, the expenditure on the home child-care allowance and the rebate for dependent spouse with child will be $1,313 million, compared with the total outlays for child care of $860 million. The figures are also there for other years. I think these are most important figures that might assist honourable senators in looking more factually at these matters in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, at this point we would normally move to the committee stage of debate. However, the government is facing a difficulty with the timing and production of amendments. I am only very lately advised that Senator Harradine has amendments which go very much to the amendments Senator Patterson had proposed but said she could not get written in time. I had earlier been advised that Senator Harradine had amendments but was not proceeding with them because of his understanding that those opposite were proceeding with theirs. I find that an amazing way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would advise Senator Harradine that, if he has amendments, he should announce them and be absolutely clear about what he wants to put forward for debate. He might have to rely on himself in the future because the opposition has been of no assistance to him this time. It certainly does not assist us to manage the flow of business through this chamber if amendments are not ready for debate.

I think there has been a great misunderstanding here. I do believe that Senator Crowley's comments were, to say the least, ungracious. I do not think they were churlish, but she was slightly ungracious. Possibly the reason for that is a misunderstanding. I did indicate that I might well move amendments in respect of the quantum of payment of the home child-care allowance. That would have been a group of amendments that I would have moved.

I do hope that the government at some stage will be looking at that question. I heard what Senator Crowley said. This legislation is setting the system up and there is no reason why substantial improvements could not be made to the home child-care allowance in future budgets. The opposition needed time to consider those questions, and no doubt also the Democrats because of their consideration of budgetary items. In those circumstances, I indicated that I would not be proceeding with the amendments. They were not these amendments that we were talking about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to telecommunications there are two very minor changes to the legislation. One is to recognise the name of Telstra, which has become the offshore trading arm of Telecom Australia, and indeed the name of the holding company. Telecom remains the domestic trading arm. That name change has simply been incorporated in legislation. In so far as the application of Telecom's universal service obligation is concerned, it has always extended to the islands and territories of Australia, but until now by regulation. This amendment simply incorporates that extension into the legislation and brings it within the same framework. There is nothing contentious about those two amendments, and the opposition will be supporting them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as the transport aspects of the bill are concerned, the amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes. Certainly, in respect of maritime legislation amendments this is true, but in the case of the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981, and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 there are issues of concern to the foreign flag shipping industry. Those are matters that I think will be dealt with by the appropriate standing committee. That aspect of the bill will be referred to the committee after the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Telecom is concerned, there are a number of ways in which I think its operations could be made more efficient. Obviously the name change is part of its strategy for coping with increased competition with Optus. If Telecom is to seriously attract more customers or retain those it has, it would be well advised to pay a lot more heed to the complaints it receives from many of its customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the fact that it has been necessary for a Casualties of Telecom&mdash;or COT cases&mdash;group to arise in the community is testimony to the fact that it has not been handling customer complaints in the manner that it should. In many respects, it has been aggravating the situation by its conduct. One does not want to say those things lightly, but from the very many complaints my office has received&mdash;a figure in excess of 250 to date; and I will put aside any other complaints I might have&mdash;it is true to say that Telecom's response in many instances has been very slow, in others misleading and certainly not to the satisfaction of those who have, on the face of it, very serious grievances. In some instances people have gone out of business as a result of complaints about the telephone service. Whilst we welcome the name change, we hope that there will be a little more accompanying it in terms of substance and I look forward to further progress on that front. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned in both the second reading speech and a moment ago by Senator Alston, in the main these amendments are relatively trivial and in the nature of tidying up. I refer in particular to two of the acts which are amended by this legislation, namely, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. A situation which has affected this country, and doubtless other countries, in relation to pollution relates to the discharge of ballast water. I refer to the discharge of water which has been taken on by ships in some other part of the world and then discharged into our region, either into our harbours or into regions near the shore and which in the case of Australia has, in at least two instances, resulted in the introduction of species which are quite damaging to the marine environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator Alston in the coalition's approach to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). Senator Alston mentioned several aspects of the bill. Briefly, I want to talk about the amendments to the Air Navigation Act and to indicate the coalition's attitude to that aspect of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated objective of the amendments proposed by the bill to the Air Navigation Act is to allow the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation or already designated on an international route can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992 the government decided that Australia should introduce a scheme of multiple designation of Australia's scheduled international air services. Bilateral arrangements govern Australia's rights to designate Australian carriers for scheduled international air services. These bilateral arrangements require that Australia's international carriers are substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. For a carrier to be designated as an Australian international carrier, it has to meet certain designation criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has announced new designation criteria. In accordance with these criteria the amendments to the act allow for the minister to require information as to foreign shareholdings from Australia's international airlines. It will further allow the minister to take all necessary action to ensure that the articles of association of a designated airline company comply with the stated foreign ownership limits; that equity held by foreign airlines in aggregate does not exceed 35 per cent of the total value of issued share capital; and that equity held by an individual foreign airline does not exceed 25 per cent of the total value of issued share capital. The articles of association must also empower the directors of the company to take whatever measures are required to enforce these limits.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the amendments allow the minister to apply for an injunction in the Federal Court requiring that the directors act in compliance with the articles of association such that the foreign ownership limits are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fairly sensible piece of legislation required for Australia to meet its international commitments in the airline industry. It is a shame that there have not been similar pieces of sensible legislation for aviation, air safety and regulation. One can understand the government's inability to manage the aviation portfolio properly when one considers that the position of minister in charge of aviation has been held by 11 different Labor ministers over a 10-year period and there have actually been 16 appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, we had Mr Kim Beazley; then Mr Peter Morris, who held transport in the early days and then took on aviation; then Senator Gareth Evans held transport and communications; Mr Clyde Holding was involved in transport and communications as minister; Senator Robert Ray was at one time minister assisting the minister for transport and communications; Mr Morris then again held transport and communications; Mr Gary Punch held telecommunications and aviation support; and, Mr Acting Deputy President, would you believe, Mrs Kelly held telecommunications and aviation support from April 1989 to April 1990. One wonders if all of the directions on aviation support were written on the whiteboard in those days, as they seem to be these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ralph Willis also held the portfolio. Senator Collins held the shipping and aviation support portfolio from May 1990 to December 1991. He then held the different portfolio of shipping and aviation from December 1991 to May 1992. Mr Beazley had transport and communications in this period. Senator Richardson also held transport and communications. Senator Cook held shipping and aviation support from May 1992 until the March 1993 election. Senator Collins came back as transport and communications minister in charge of aviation from May 1992 until very recently, when mercifully we got a more competent minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is no wonder the government is in such disarray with its aviation policy, with a total of 16 appointments in just 10 years. It is an amazing record of ministerial and portfolio reshuffling. It is no wonder that our aviation policy is in such a mess, and some of our air safety records are in such a mess. I have to say that Senator Collins excelled himself in his inability to properly get on top of that particular portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And a lot of other portfolios as well; but my brief today is in the aviation field. But it does seem unfortunate the way Senator Collins actually handled that portfolio. I had a considerable amount of difficulty in getting any sensible assistance from Senator Collins. In fact I asked a continuing set of questions about the CAA and air safety. These were asked over a period of time since I became very interested in this, following an air crash at Young in which a friend of mine was killed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time a lot of people have been giving me tips and information about the atrocious state of air safety in our community, and I have tried to follow them through in a sensible way with the then minister, but it has not been easy. A series of questions that I asked at the last estimates committee hearing back in November were not answered until just a couple of days ago when the estimates were coming up again. They were all questions about air safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems appalling that the members of this parliament cannot get sensible answers quickly on matters of air safety. Honourable senators will recall that last year, as part of the questions I was raising, Senator Collins was reported to me&mdash;and I mentioned it to the Senate&mdash;as having changed minutes of a CAA meeting as they related to some answers he had given at estimates committees, and on some matters relating to air safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it has taken me this long to get answers&mdash;from one estimates committee to the next&mdash;just shows what a state this department is in. Although just two days ago I received a huge sheaf of those answers from the previous estimates committee, several questions were not answered at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that either the minister or the department hoped that, with the effluxion of time, senators would forget the questions they asked and that they would not be followed up. That can be the only explanation for questions having taken this long to be answered. I look forward with some relish to being at the estimates committees when we get to transport, to find out why it did take so long for those questions to be answered, to pursue the ones that have not been answered and also to pursue a lot of other information that people who are genuinely concerned with air safety in Australia keep giving to me. I keep getting reports&mdash;some anonymously&mdash;about the maladministration of the CAA and the department generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether it is unfair to blame Senator Collins for all that mess. As I say, there has been such a range of different ministers and a reallocation of the portfolios over the past 10 years. It is a wonder anyone in the department knows anything that is happening. Certainly none of the ministers appears to have got on top of it. Senator Collins was not a good minister for aviation or aviation support or transport&mdash;whatever it happened to be called. His great claim to being the greatest minister involved in shipping and waterfront reform is something that he has been preaching for many months. But we have seen the results of Senator Collins's efforts on the waterfront in the last few days, when certain parts of Australia have been crippled by waterfront strikes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this government is simply unable to manage the waterfront, and certainly not able to manage aviation and air safety. As I said, this legislation does contain some sensible amendments to the Air Navigation Act to enhance Australia's position in international air travel. All that very much enhances our position as one of the major tourist destinations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to support any legislation that will mean a boost to our international tourism. International tourism is perhaps the fastest growing and most efficient and progressive industry that Australia currently has. It is certainly one that has gathered us an enormous amount of foreign currency revenue. It is one which, I am very pleased to say&mdash;and always proud to mention&mdash;is being very greatly expanded in the Townsville region and particularly the Cairns region of Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, enhancing the ability of Australian carriers to move into the international market, can only indirectly at the present time&mdash;but I have no doubt it will be directly in the future&mdash;enhance tourism in that area of Australia where the tourism industry has really taken off, and continues to expand very rapidly for the benefit of that part of Australia and Australia generally. As my colleague mentioned, the coalition will be supporting the bill. I confirm that we will certainly be supporting that part of the bill which deals with those aviation matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1994 is a very important bill for people such as Senator Schacht because it concerns his pay rise. It is a machinery bill which seeks a further appropriation of $77,000 to be made available for an increase in ministerial salaries.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns were raised by my colleague the member for Bradfield, Mr Connolly, in the debate in the other place on 21 February. I hope that the minister dealing with this bill may be able to provide us with some information about some of those concerns. Rather than repeat what Mr Connolly said in the House of Representatives, I will quickly recap those concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill is that it appropriates $77,000 to cover a salary increase of 1.5 per cent in the ministerial salary component of ministers' salaries. The 1.5 per cent increase which is coming through as a result of the increase in SES salaries during March 1994 is automatically paid to other backbenchers, office holders and so forth. But because of the provisions in the constitution that the parliament provide for ministerial salaries, it is necessary to pass these ministers of state amendment bills from time to time when the ministerial component of salaries is increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point made by my friend and colleague Mr Connolly in the House of Representatives is that the $77,000 represents more than a 1.5 per cent increase. It was represented in the second reading speech by the person handling the bill in the other place that a contingency allowance needs to be made for this appropriation for a range of circumstances, including when there are Acting Prime Ministers and ministers acting in other capacities. However, it seems that the amount that goes into what is probably called an imprest account could indeed be distributed at the discretion of the Prime Minister. I ask the minister to explain to the Senate why the amount of $77,000 was chosen when that amount would cover well in excess of the 1.5 per cent salary increase to ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that there are a lot of people in the community at the moment who would find giving pay rises to people such as Minister Kelly at this particular time quite abhorrent. In fact, many people in the community would think that Ros Kelly, the minister for sports and whiteboards and various other things, should not receive any ministerial salary at all. They probably hope that Mrs Kelly might go away and think she should never have been given a job as a minister. The sports rorts affair that goes on day after day would reaffirm in people's minds the fact that she is not performing her duties as one would expect. Most people in the community would see the giving of a pay rise to Mrs Kelly, for example, as quite repugnant, after her performances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of those people in the parliament who thinks that most members of parliament and senators on both sides of the chamber and also ministers are not remunerated highly enough. I think it was my friend Peter Shack who told me a couple of years ago before he left this place that the remuneration of members of parliament had decreased by something like 24 per cent in real terms since he was elected as the member for Tangney in 1977. You would remember that better than I, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to attract people to the important business of politics, people from either side of the chamber should never take cheap shots at remuneration for MPs. I am prepared to put that on the record. If indeed Mr Shack was right and remuneration has fallen by 24 per cent in that time, that is a matter of regret because slowly but surely the sort of people who make the sacrifices that are required to come into the parliament will not be there to make those sacrifices, and the quality of representation of the people will slowly but surely fall. I think that would be most regrettable for the good governance of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding perceptions within the community of giving pay rises to people such as Mrs Kelly and our Senate colleague Senator Collins, the minister who was responsible or irresponsible for the pay TV fiasco, one has to wonder just what the electors of Australia would think at the parliament granting these people pay rises. If we criticise the pay increases on the basis of performance and start picking off individual ministers we can get into some trouble. However, we would not have the opportunity to pick on pay rises for people like Mrs Kelly and Senator Collins if the Prime Minister enforced what are sound and sensible assessments of ministerial responsibility and ministerial competence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister had done what he should have done, he would have got rid of Mrs Kelly when it became quite obvious to everyone else in Australia that she had failed as a minister, and Senator Collins, who promised to resign if he failed on waterfront reform&mdash;and he has demonstrably failed on waterfront reform. We have a perfect example in my home state of Western Australia where the whole of Fremantle closed down for 10 days over the last couple of weeks because of a fight over on the Sydney waterfront. If that is what Senator Collins calls waterfront reform, and he promised to resign if he did not get it through, then he will not even stand by his own standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might seem a politically cheap shot to pick on Mrs Kelly and Senator Collins and say that they do not deserve their pay rises&mdash;of course Senator Schacht deserves his. But if the Prime Minister really deserved his pay rise, which I am told is in the order of $5,000 or $2,700, and he had done his job and stuck by the levels of credibility that one would demand of a Prime Minister, he would not have Senator Collins still on the front bench and he would not have Minister Kelly on his front bench. We would have people who were doing their jobs properly, who were not bringing the entire business of politics into disrepute, and we would not even be having to raise these points on this sort of bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister could answer those questions in relation to why it is $77,000 and why that is much more than the 1.5 per cent, I would be most appreciative. I know that Mr Connolly has sought that advice from the department previously and it has not been provided, to the best of my knowledge. That would be helpful, it would be of assistance for the future and I would appreciate it. Otherwise, the opposition will support the passage of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA>At the outset, I wish to state that this document hints at some of the medium and long-term policy issues that should be of great concern to this parliament. The first issue I wish to raise on this occasion is the question of the independence of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which monitors the activities of ANSTO. Many of the staff at the Nuclear Safety Bureau are on secondment from ANSTO with the right to return to ANSTO, and the Nuclear Safety Bureau itself operates from premises adjacent to the ANSTO premises at Lucas Heights. As the report of the Safety Review Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SRC considers this to be a less than ideal situation in regard to the perceived independence of the NSB . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I trust that this matter will be addressed by government as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. The residents of the Sutherland shire in particular have justifiable concerns about the safety of the Lucas Heights establishment in their neighbourhood and need assurance that the organisation monitoring the safety aspects of the ANSTO operations is independent and reliable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to raise some concerns about the accumulating level of waste that emanates from the operations of ANSTO and the other nuclear waste that is stored at Lucas Heights. The greatest problem that this operation faces is the limited storage space at the site and the ever increasing storage requirements due to the continued operations of the reactor and associated activities. The SRC report acknowledges this when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . accumulation of ANSTO wastes will eventually strain current storage facilities if no progress is made on a national repository.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the crux of the issue. One of the key reasons why we have not established a national waste repository is that there are substantial and justifiable community concerns about the safety of any waste disposal options proposed by ANSTO or the government. We should not be continuing to produce nuclear waste when we have no acceptable disposal or storage technology available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The related question of the 10,000 drums of contaminated soil from Fishermans Bend in Victoria is also of great concern. There is a requirement that these drums be removed from the site by February 1995, but there are no acceptable alternative storage options available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing safety of the HIFAR reactor is also of great concern. The Acting Director of the Nuclear Safety Bureau points to concerns in this regard, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . NSB agreement to the continued operation of HIFAR beyond 1995 will be conditional on the completion of current upgrading work . . . and that the remaining life of HIFAR should not extend beyond ten years without major safety upgrading.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the SRC report points to problems in relation to the seismic safety of the HIFAR reactor. It appears that `the issue of the seismic resistance of HIFAR remains unresolved'. I trust that the residents of Sutherland shire are given solid  assurances in this regard as a matter of urgency, given the proximity of the reactor to residents in that locality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that the Greens are not convinced about the cost-effectiveness of a nuclear reactor in this country and have great concerns about the ability of any nuclear facility to guarantee safety standards. Therefore, we will be strongly opposed to either a new nuclear reactor or the upgrading of HIFAR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical uses of nuclear technology could be satisfied in this country through the construction of cyclotron facilities in strategic locations combined with the import of longer term isotopes from existing overseas reactors. The best way to avoid concerns about safety or to avoid waste disposal problems, however, is not to have a nuclear reactor in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the same report in view of Senator Margetts' comments. I am the minister responsible for ANSTO, as she is obviously aware, and I am also responsible for a number of related matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts raised the question of the Nuclear Safety Bureau being positioned within ANSTO. I want to point out that I do not have all the details with me because I was unaware that this was coming on for discussion. Moves are afoot to rectify that and there are changes being made. I hope that the matters that Senator Margetts raised will be able to be dealt with in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other changes being made to the operation of the Nuclear Safety Bureau itself. Those arrangements will ultimately lead to the Minister for Health having responsibility for the regulatory functions. I have always had a view that the minister for industry or the portfolio minister in the industry area, such as me, who is responsible for ANSTO itself should not also be the minister responsible for the safety regime because quite clearly from time to time there can be a conflict of interest. For example, if there were a difference between ANSTO and the Nuclear Safety Bureau over some safety issue, at the moment I would be answering within the parliament two different sets of advice, and I do not think that would be appropriate. That was one of the decisions taken by the government last November on nuclear matters&mdash;the decision to have the regulatory function and the safety aspects transferred to another ministry. I welcome that, and that was my recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the general issue of the future of ANSTO, the government has decided that there will be no need to make a decision for another five years on whether we need to have a new reactor in Australia. That will be a matter of considerable public debate because it would be a major expenditure if the government did agree to build a new reactor. At that time, I am sure Senator Margetts or others will enjoin that debate, as is appropriate and proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to point out and place on the record that the McKinnon review of the operation of the HIFAR reactor at ANSTO gave a clean bill of health as far as the management and the safety of the functions of the reactor are concerned. McKinnon's recommendation was that all the issues raised by the local community and others were being adequately dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue that he raised, which is a proposition now before government, is to have a probabilistic survey of the reactor itself. That is to determine how much longer the reactor can be considered to safely operate. It is not, in any way, to be taken as an indication of alarm that there is anything wrong with the present operation of the reactor. After a very extensive review, with a wide range of evidence taken, Professor McKinnon said that the reactor is safe and is being properly managed in accordance with the highest levels of safety standards in Australia. I want to put that on the record so that there is no misunderstanding, particularly for the local residents in the Sutherland Shire Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing that I want to say&mdash;particularly to Senator Margetts, in view of her interest&mdash;is that in the near future I will be convening a meeting of senior management from ANSTO and senior councillors from the Sutherland Shire Council to establish an ongoing mechanism whereby issues of dispute between ANSTO and the local council, representing the local population, can be dealt with across the table in a dialogue rather than in confrontation. Obviously, they will not always agree; but we want to establish a better mechanism than has been operating in the past so that both sides get a chance to talk directly with each other, and not past each other, about the issues relating to the operation of ANSTO at the Lucas Heights site in the Sutherland Shire Council area. </PARA>

Yet&mdash;and this is a matter that I bring up every year&mdash;this government sees fit to contribute $413,000 to tobacco research in Australia.

I do not want to drive the tobacco industry out of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the South Australian Farmers Federation, more than one-third of the State's 14,000 farmers were living on or below the poverty line late last year.</PARA>

<PARA>What we are calling for from government is not a series of handouts; indeed, it is for no more tinkering around the edges. It is for a commitment from government that there will be a change of political will&mdash;in other words, a political commitment to actually do something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the Senate an example of the depth of this problem&mdash;and I am only talking about one specific aspect tonight&mdash;I will read some figures from the rural counselling service in South Australia. These are only for the period from January to June 1993. In other words, these are dealing only with the clients that the rural counselling service in South Australia was assisting during that period. If we look first at the statistics for total debt, we find that in the Barossa and Light regions, for the clients the service was helping, it was $18,666,000. For the eastern Eyre Peninsula, one counsellor was handling families with total debts of $36,391,000 and another counsellor handled families whose total debts were $27,578,000. Perhaps one of the grimmest statistics is from Kangaroo Island where the total debts, just for the families supported, were $23,140,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the average debt per client, we see how serious this is. On Kangaroo Island the average debt per  client is $335,374. If we look at eastern Eyre Peninsula, we see that the average debt is somewhere between $176,000 and $246,000. If we move on to the upper and mid-north areas, we find that the total debt for families was $47,247,000. The average debt per family was $218,736. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look to the Riverland we find that just one of the counsellors there had clients with total debts over $16 million, and the average debt was $151,837. In the south-east, the clients assisted there had total debts around $50 million, with the average debt around $320,000. Just in that one period&mdash;January to June 1993&mdash;the total debt of clients of the rural counselling service was over $303 million. The average debt of clients of rural counsellors was over $25 million. The average debt per client across the state was $242,000 and more. This is totally unsustainable. We need policies now that address this issue. It is an issue of equity. No, we are not talking about debt write-off; we are talking about constructive schemes to support farm families. There have been three or four schemes that certainly deserve consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the average equity figures we can understand the depth of this problem. The average equity in the far west, for example, is only 17 per cent; the average equity on Kangaroo Island is 36 per cent; and the average equity in the Murraylands is 39 per cent. Indeed, across the state the average equity in farms now is only around 50 per cent for those being supported by the rural counselling service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that period of time 112 families were adjusted, if I may use the term, out of farming. In other words, there were 112 family units whose skills are now lost to us and to the land. Generally they have had to relocate themselves, often right out of the district, away from friends the kids have made and away from the support services formerly enjoyed by the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to look at the workload on the rural counsellors themselves, the hours worked per week range from, for Barossa and Light, 65 hours a week, to 48 for those in the Broken Hill region, to 64 and 56 for the two counsellors on eastern Eyre Peninsula, to 47 in the far west and to 53 on Kangaroo Island. The average per rural counsellor is 53 hours per week, yet we hear rumours that in this year's budget there will be a decrease in the level of funding for rural counsellors. The average number of kilometres travelled by each counsellor is over 24,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we can look at the whole issue of debt with another set of figures; we can look at debt in arrears. Some 15 of these farming family units have major problems with being in arrears with debts. Indeed, only 10 of those families being supported had no debts whatsoever. Indeed, if we look at 50 per cent equity, some 650 families out of the 1,314 owed more than they actually had in equity in the farm&mdash;in other words, they had over 50 per cent of debt owing compared to the value of the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are just a few figures I can give in the time available to me tonight. We are now asking government for real commitment. Yes, there have been specific measures, and one went through this chamber today that will be of benefit in a small way. The child-care cash rebate for women staying at home is about to become available to these families. Previously these families missed out on that because they did not have a taxable income, and therefore could not take advantage of the dependant spouse rebate. People were only able to get that if they were at a sufficient income level to actually pay tax. So one of the groups that will benefit from the way that dependent spouse rebate will be cashed out will include, I would say, virtually all the families that I am talking about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those little bits and pieces around the edges are not enough. Even an increase in funding which I hope we will see for rural counsellors is not enough. We need real political commitment from this government. We now have a new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, but I suspect that as yet he does not realise the extent of the problems he is now facing in his new portfolio, and I certainly wish him well. We certainly need a minister who is prepared to travel, who will not rely on reports or second- or third-hand comments but who will actually go out and meet farm families and who will travel in rural parts of Australia. Obviously he will still need to meet with industry representatives, the National Farmers Federation, for example, but he should not leave the matter there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite Senator Collins to travel in South Australia, in particular to Kangaroo Island, to the south-east, the mid-north and the west coast. I ask him to meet with rural counsellors and their clients to discuss what the government plans to do right across the board, not just in bits and pieces around the edge, to keep farming families on their farms. Hopefully we will see a real commitment by government and a real acknowledgment that we need to keep people in rural Australia. We should not simply be prepared to sit back and see a further deterioration in the quality of services and in the numbers of people living in rural areas. </PARA>

This is a major social problem, and I was drawing attention to it, but Senator Crowley in her quite vitriolic way imputed to me thoughts and motives which are completely the opposite of the point I was trying to make. It was quite unwarranted, unfair and unfortunate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would suggest to me that Senator Crowley does not really appreciate the problem that we were drawing attention to.

I congratulate Senator McGauran for drawing attention to it. I have had petitions numbering in the thousands coming into my office over this whole issue of discrimination against mothers who choose to stay at home to look after their children compared with those who go out to work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to briefly draw the attention of the Senate to a matter which was featured on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 20 February, the Starcke land sale in northern Queensland. Honourable senators will recall this has been very much in the news for quite some time now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I placed on notice a series of questions asking the minister representing the Attorney-General about a number of serious matters raised about the proposed sale of the property known as Starcke on Cape York Peninsula. I understand until yesterday the land was owned by George Quaid Holdings of Cairns, but that yesterday the Queensland government acted to acquire the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To refresh the memory of honourable senators, Starcke was assessed as being of high wilderness value in the 1992 national wilderness survey. On 26 February 1993, Quaid Holdings advertised the property for sale in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS> for $US18 million or $A26 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, there was outrage at the prospect of such a sale from many quarters, particularly among the traditional owners of the region who were relocated in the 1930s, and from environmentalists concerned that the property would become a frontier game park or even a residential area. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program highlighted the complete lack of regard the developer had shown on a previous occasion when he built a series of lakes and destroyed millions of trees in the process, eventually clogging the catchment of Australia's second longest river system with the resultant forest debris. Honourable senators would recall the construction of a road through the world heritage area north of Cairns without permission. The Queensland Government acquired Starcke yesterday from George Quaid Holdings in order to have it declared a national park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter this evening because the Commonwealth government is likely to become involved in the question of compensation. Some senators here will be aware that recently in matters regarding compensation and handling of moneys the Commonwealth government has not been particularly diligent in the way it has distributed those funds and the way in which they have been spent. Clearly, this acquisition is likely to be followed by a lengthy inquiry to determine exactly the amount of compensation likely to be payable to George Quaid Holdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to a legal opinion given by Mr John Greenwood QC to the Wilderness Society in relation to George Quaid Holdings and the failure of that company to uphold the conditions of its previous lease. He says, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems fairly clear that whatever other conditions have been broken, the fencing requirement of 150 miles of stock proof fencing has not been met. The total claimed spent by Quaid on fencing (and other items) in Cockrell's figures was only $65,722. This certainly is at odds with the $120,000 given to Allen.</PARA>
<PARA>On the next page he talks quite specifically about the issue of whether fraud had been involved in the breach of conditions. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the provisions in Section 295 of the Act which allows the Crown to forfeit a lease if there has been a breach of condition by the lessee, Section 296 allows the Crown to forfeit a lease if the lessee is shown to have `acquired or held' (the lease) `in evasion of or by fraud upon this Act'. A forfeiture under Section 296 can have far reaching consequences on the lessee.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table this legal opinion by John Greenwood, and I can assure the Senate it has been cleared with both the whips. </PARA>

There has been the subsequent acquisition of this land by the Queensland government and involvement by the federal government in relation to compensation; the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has offered to contribute to that compensation. There is the question of whether George Quaid Holdings has upheld the conditions of the lease and is or is not, therefore, liable for forfeiture of the lease in any case without any compensation. The question of the extent of the compensation&mdash;whether it relates to money actually spent or forgone future profits had the land been allowed for subdivision or tourist development&mdash;is very relevant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two days ago in question time I asked Senator Crowley, as Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, what action the Office of the Status of Women had taken to redress the slurs directed at Australia's nuns through the publication of certain definitions in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary Thesaurus</EMPHASIS>. This was a very serious question and it has yet to be answered by the minister. It is 48 hours since that question was asked. It was a matter which received broad media coverage&mdash;on television, on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>, in a major article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>That is basically the question put to Senator Crowley about which I have yet to receive an answer. The various women's groups and the Office of the Status of Women have shown in the past that they are aggressively sensitive to insults of a gender based kind directed at women, and rightly so. They have been very quick off the mark to defend the interests of other women offended by what they claim to be community based, gender driven attitudes. The debased and derogatory slurs printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS> against the gentle, female religious orders of nuns are no different from past outrages.

As Senator O'Chee pointed out, perhaps they are not radical feminists. The Office of the Status of Women and Senator Crowley are only interested in the political attitudes of certain women, not in defending the cause of women as a separate gender; just a sector of women, not women in general. Otherwise, they would have sprung immediately to the defence of the nuns regarding such vulgar language. They are only interested in the Labor politics of some women. The total silence of the Office of the Status of Women and the female ministers has proven this to be very true. I call upon Senator Crowley to at least answer my question, as would be the normal courtesy in the Senate. I challenge her to give her own personal view on such slurs against nuns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to make some brief remarks by way of response to Senator Coulter's discussion as to the acquisition of the Starcke properties. I think it is highly unusual for someone in the parliament to discuss the compulsory acquisition of properties. I understand, having seen part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program last Sunday, that a portion of that property is leased and a portion of it is freehold. We can talk as much as we like about the history of those properties and the way they have been developed. That is not particularly germane to the point that Senator Coulter made this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that an acquisition process is going on. We are led to believe by Senator Coulter and, I presume, that part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that I missed, that a portion of that acquisition is freehold. I presume that acquisition will take place under the land act as it applies to Queensland. I assume it is a Queensland government acquisition and not a Commonwealth one, although I understand that the Commonwealth may get involved by making a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the price that Mr Quaid advertised the property at in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS> is probably quite irrelevant to what valuers would apply under the normal acquisition process in terms of value of the property. Whether Mr Quaid thought it was worth $A26 million or $US18 million when he advertised the property in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS> a number of years ago is probably quite irrelevant. Normal compulsory acquisition processes usually require a valuer to go in and make an assessment. Then, if the vendor of the property&mdash;in this case, Mr Quaid and interests associated with him&mdash;disagree with that valuation, they seek a separate valuation. In the end, there would be some form of arbitration on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways it is most unfair and just cheap, political point scoring on the part of Senator Coulter for him to come in here and try to say that the Commonwealth should not pay very much for this property because Mr Quaid and his interests should not have owned it in the first place because&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee says, perhaps it is because Senator Coulter does not like Mr Quaid. It is an abuse of the federal parliament and the Senate in particular. It really is a matter that needs to go through due process. Trying to interfere by alleging that Mr Quaid's leases were not valid for some reason shows what little understanding Senator Coulter has of these issues. If, as has been alleged here tonight, certain conditions of the leases had not been fulfilled, the Queensland government of course would not have to go through the compulsory acquisition process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Quaid had not fulfilled the conditions of the lease, I am quite sure that the Goss government, in looking after the interests of the taxpayer of Queensland, would say, `Sorry, you haven't fulfilled the conditions of your lease, we will take it back, and it will revert to the Crown'. But that is not the case, as I understand it. I assure the Senate that I do not know much more than what I heard on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, even though I have visited the area with my friend Senator Ian Macdonald on a couple of occasions. Of course I support what Senator Coulter says about the area and its beauty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am firmly of the view, however, that we do not need to create world heritage areas or publicly-owned national parks to preserve the heritage features of areas. I am a strong advocate of ensuring that significant incentives are put in place for people who own private property to ensure that conservation and other values are protected. We have a number of very good examples of that very close to home here in Australia with people like Dr Walmsley in South Australia who are creating privately-owned sanctuaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are much bigger examples in the United States where a number of massive national parks and conservation zones are owned by private companies, private operators and, in some cases, conservation groups which manage those conservation areas for profit and ensure that the community gets maximum use out of them. I have never advocated that the only way to save a wilderness area is for the government to draw a line around it, call it world heritage and then try to manage it from miles away in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter has made a serious criticism by coming in here and trying to get himself involved in the compensation process of the Starcke properties. In fact, it is interesting to note that, in our debate last Thursday on the lease that has been granted to Malcolm Douglas in Broome to expand his crocodile farming operations&mdash;a development that has now been destroyed, at least for the next 30 days, by the unheralded, unnecessary intervention of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, by placing a Federal Court order to stop the project on 4 February&mdash;Senator Coulter did not express, so far as I can remember, any views on that process and that intervention in relation to a lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Native Title Act&mdash;or the national land rights scheme, as I like to call it&mdash;which passed through this Senate chamber last December, we will see an enormous number of compulsory acquisitions of pastoral leases throughout Australia. In Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia, we will see this land acquisition fund put towards purchasing&mdash;in some cases, compulsorily, I presume&mdash;thousands upon thousands of hectares of pastoral country which will then be handed across to Australian Aboriginals and will have an enormous effect on the pastoral industries across those states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us will know the effect that that land acquisition and those compulsory acquisitions will have until they take place. But one only needs to look at our experiences in Western Australia&mdash;experiences that I am fully aware of, and I am sure there are other examples in South Australia and northern Queensland&mdash;to find out what can happen when pastoral leases are not managed in a way that takes into account the very fragile nature of the environment there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very sad things about the handing over of pastoral leases on the basis of race, which will occur under the Native Title Act&mdash;the national land rights scheme&mdash;is that these pastoral leases will be handed over, not because the managers of the land, the custodians of the land, are good at managing pastoral properties, but because of ideological and other motivations of some Canberra-based politician. It worries me that unless appropriate support mechanisms are put in place, the processes that will take place over the next five or 10 years as a result of the native title legislation will wreak havoc on the environment in the remote areas of Australia which I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to link Senator Coulter's comments to future ones he may make to see how often he involves himself in the compulsory acquisition processes and the land acquisition processes that will take place under the national land rights scheme, which he was so fervent in his support for. Senator Coulter has focused very narrowly upon this particular acquisition taking place in northern Queensland. He has probably done so for the reason that Senator O'Chee mentioned earlier&mdash;that is, he has a personal dislike for Mr Quaid and his modus operandi. It would be far more fair and even handed if Senator Coulter involved himself in land management issues in a far more balanced way and did not approach them in a narrowly focused, personality-driven way. I think it is an indictment upon his getting involved in a process that should go through due process to ensure that all parties leave the negotiations with a fair result.</PARA>

I did not hear Senator Coulter's speech to which Senator Campbell was responding, but I do not think I needed to. I am pretty well aware of what the Australian Democrats think about things like this. The fact, as Senator Campbell says, that the Democrats are not really interested in due process when it comes to resumption of land does not surprise me at all because the Democrats do not have much regard for ownership of private property. It suits their socialist left view on life about private property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply wish to draw the Senate's attention to some other matters in relation to Starcke Holdings. I have just heard that an announcement was made earlier this afternoon that mining exploration was continuing on Starcke Holdings. Apparently, there have been some discoveries of valuable minerals there. The Queensland minister for mines has been speaking to the media about them this afternoon. It is an interesting development on the Starcke Holdings, and one wonders what that might do to the value of any compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to draw to the attention of the Senate that last night in the estimates committee hearing we inquired into the funding of the buy-back of Starcke Holdings. I agree with Senator Campbell that, whatever it is, it should be a proper and legitimate price. Failing a negotiated result, it can be determined in the land courts as a resumption matter but, hopefully, it will be negotiated between the current owner and the other party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has said that the buy-back figure will be in the single digit millions&mdash;figures ranging between six and 10 million have been mentioned&mdash;and some months ago on national television, Mrs Kelly said that the Commonwealth government would provide the Queensland government with matching funds for that buy-back. However, when Mrs Kelly was subsequently questioned at the last estimates committee, it appeared that, according to her department, `matching funds' did not mean dollar-for-dollar funding but joint funding. When we inquired into the meaning of `joint funding', we found that it meant that the department would talk to the Queensland government about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was keen to pursue the matter a bit further at last night's estimates hearing. From evidence given, it transpired that the department of the environment will now be contributing no more than $1 million to the buy-back price. Even that is dependent upon, firstly, putting a management regime in place that is suitable to the commonwealth government and, secondly, the purchase price being, in the view of the commonwealth government, a reasonable one. There are lots of ifs and buts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, since this comes from Mrs Kelly's office, one wonders how she reached those figures. I guess she wrote them on a whiteboard as well and came up with the fact that $1 million was the right amount to offer. However, it is a betrayal of the Queensland government and the people of Queensland that Mrs Kelly's promise of matching funding turns out to mean a maximum of $1 million from her department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of Starcke Holdings&mdash;the northern Daintree area of Cape York&mdash;is an area of heritage and environmental value, as is the Great Barrier Reef. I also draw to the attention of the Senate evidence given at last night's estimates committee meeting about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The authority has indicated that 10 per cent of its resources&mdash;it only has a fairly small budget of $24 million for both capital and recurrent expenditure&mdash;is currently used to deal with Aboriginal and Islander issues. That means that resources that should be used for the purposes of the authority are being diverted elsewhere. I am not saying that it is improper for it to deal with Aboriginal and Islander groups&mdash;it is essential that it does&mdash;but it must be properly funded to do so. It should not be required to use its existing budget for those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director of the authority, Professor Kelleher, also said last night that he was concerned by the amount of his budget that would have to be spent in the future on legal costs because of the many Mabo type claims that will be made in relation to the Great Barrier Reef and the marine parks. He pointed out that the authority was recently involved in a court case to defend one of its decisions and ended up with a bill of $1 million for legal costs. That was just one court case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Kelleher indicated that Aboriginal groups have made a claim with respect to the whole of the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. Whether those claims are substantiated or not, they will interfere with the work of the authority, which is to direct how the reef should be dealt with. If the authority makes a decision that goes against a developer, a reef operator or marine operator, it could expect Aboriginal groups with a claim to appeal the decision. If it is made against a developer and in favour of Aboriginal groups, it could expect the developer to appeal. The authority is therefore very concerned that its budget will be gobbled up by its becoming involved in Mabo type claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning in the Senate I mentioned that the authority is really strapped for cash. I do not have time to elaborate on that but it is to such an extent that the Great Barrier Reef Wonderland at Townsville&mdash;that marvellous world class aquarium that transposes the Great Barrier Reef onto the mainland for everyone to see&mdash;is in danger of closing down because of lack of funds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In March 1993 formal agreement was reached between the International Labour Office and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) under which the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific manages an AIDAB funded project titled Australian Support for International Labour Organisation Objectives in Asia (ASILO). This project assists the ILO to draw on Australian expertise to provide technical assistance to Labour Ministries, trade unions and employer organisations in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Amongst other ASILO activities an ILO consultant has held discussions in Indonesia with a number of organisations, including with the SPSI. A program of technical assistance is being formulated to assist in the development of effective enterprise and industry level trade union organisations. The details of this program are not yet available. The ASILO project also enables the ILO to provide technical assistance to the Indonesian Government, focused on certain aspects of occupational safety and health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The estimates of employed persons in far north Queensland for January 1991 and September 1993 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) monthly Labour Force Survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labour Force Survey is a national multi-stage area sample of private dwellings (currently about 29,000 houses, flats, etc.) and a list sample of non-private dwellings (hotels, motels etc.). Some 65,000 persons across Australia currently take part in the survey each month. The information is obtained from the occupants of selected dwellings by carefully chosen and specially trained interviewers. More information about the design and conduct of the survey can be found in Information Paper: Measuring Employment and Unemployment (ABS Catalogue No. 6279.0).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labour Force Survey is designed to produce reliable employment and unemployment estimates for Australia and for each State/Territory. However, estimates for various regions within States, such as far north Queensland, are also available as a by-product of the survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The increase of 56 per cent in persons employed in the Far North Queensland Statistical Region between January 1991 and September 1993 is derived from the Labour Force Survey. The estimate of employment growth is consistent with the other labour force estimates from that survey. In the same period the Labour Force Survey shows increases of 70 per cent in unemployment, 58 per cent in persons not in the labour force, and 44 per cent in the civilian population aged 15 years and over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it must be remembered these estimates are only by-products of a survey designed to produce reliable labour force estimates at the national, State and Territory level. The sample at the regional level is necessarily small and the estimates are therefore subject to significant sampling error. The comparison of estimates over time may also have been affected by a sample reselection which followed the 1991 Census of Population and Housing.</PARA>
