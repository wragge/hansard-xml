<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to yesterday's ABS earnings distribution survey, which revealed that in the year to May 1993 the percentage increase in weekly total earnings for the top 10 per cent of earners was 2 1/2 times that of the bottom 10 per cent. This came on top of last week's social trends survey, which revealed increasing inequality and polarisation into low and high income earners, and the most recent United Nations report on human development, which found that Australia has the highest level of income disparity of any OECD country. Is this not further evidence of the fact that, under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and that a new underclass is developing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I suppose we ought to be grateful for small mercies. We did not have any economic questions at all yesterday, which was not surprising because the news that came out yesterday in the context of the BCA response to the survey of investment intentions and the news that came out a day or so earlier about current levels of foreign debt were both in the nature of good news and, as such, utterly beyond the pale as far as the opposition is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular survey to which Senator Hill refers tells us nothing particularly new. What matters when we are talking about income distribution is not only the spread as between rich and poor but also what the actual substantive levels are. If the levels at which the poorest people in the country live are comparatively higher than elsewhere and they are of a status or standing which is appropriate to enable them to function effectively as individuals and households, and to be above any poverty line, one can argue about the implications of that distribution in terms of the case for higher taxation at the top and so on, but there is no basic underlying economic or social problem thereby revealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about the Australian government's approach to income distribution and, in particular, family income distribution, has been to ensure that at the bottom level&mdash;where every dollar for every individual and every household really matters&mdash;the story has been a very good one indeed. The trouble with some of the surveys, as I have said previously, is that they do not sufficiently take into account the redistributive effects of taxation scales and they certainly do not take into account non-cash income. The non-cash income that is available to people other than through specific wage and salary income is very substantial indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole contribution of this government has been towards improving the total actual income, or the de facto income, that individuals and households have enjoyed, and through the measures that we have adopted in housing, education, health and everywhere else, the benefits are very real indeed. The purchasing power of the income dollars that people have is significantly greater than in most other comparable countries. In that particular environment this government has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and we make no apology for the policies we have been adopting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that was an astonishing answer. As a supplementary question, I ask the minister to focus on the survey that I addressed, and that is the ABS earnings distribution survey which said that the percentage increase in weekly total earnings for the top 10 per cent of earners was 2 1/2 times that of the bottom 10 per cent of earners. How can the minister otherwise explain that than to accept that under his government the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that the poor in this country are not getting poorer. There have been substantial increases in the capacity of the lower income levels of our society to purchase the goods and services and to enjoy the benefits that this society has to offer because of the nature of the social income that is being made available to people, not only through taxation reductions and so on, but through the goods and services and the benefits that are available as a result of the expenditure programs right across the spectrum of health, housing, education and social welfare that I have been talking about. In that particular context there is no increase in the absolute level of deprivation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to argue about relative deprivation, I suppose we can argue about that. But the gap is only a meaningful gap if there are real problems at the bottom end of the spectrum, and that is not so. What is happening at the top end of the spectrum is that in an improved economic environment there are more returns available. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. In the light of the minister's visit to Singapore last week, is Australia capitalising on growth in our region to improve our exports of advanced manufactures and services?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1368" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question both generally and in the particular. Overall, there has been a very rapid increase in our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and services, and it will continue and strengthen as a result of initiatives taken in the white paper in the generality. For example, the initiatives include the continuation of export market development grants to assist 5,000 largely small to medium size exporters and extending the coverage of the scheme to include single service tourism operators; by the continuation of the international trade enhancement scheme; and by strengthening offshore market support for Australian exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the white paper has underpinned the strength that has been exhibited in increasing exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and services to the extent that the composition of Australia's trade has changed very significantly, and is continuing to change, and thus has the capacity to deliver the sort of job mix that the work force, with training, is suited for. Services now account for around 20 per cent of total manufactures and elaborately transformed manufactures account for about 15 per cent. The growth in elaborately transformed manufactures has averaged about 20 per cent over the last seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a significant change&mdash;virtually a transformation&mdash;and a transformation that is fundamentally important to job creation. It has particular significance in the light of Senator Forshaw's question about Singapore. Last week I visited the telecommunications trade fair&mdash;Communicasia&mdash;and the associated Broadcast Asia exhibition. There were 48 Australian companies participating. Those companies put on a very impressive display&mdash;one of the most impressive there&mdash;and they considered it a particularly successful exhibition. The companies received a large number of inquiries and requests and, surprisingly from the floor of a trade fair such as that, they made quite a few sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecommunications is a very important growth sector in our region. Telecommunications purchases last year alone throughout Asia were worth $A15 billion, and the expectation is that they could be worth $A50 billion in five years time. This creates an enormous opportunity for Australian exporters of manufactures and services. Australian exports of telecommunications services and equipment already exceed $1 billion annually. I think we underestimate the extent to which we do well in those areas. The goal in five years is to reach $2 billion. It sounds a very dramatic increase&mdash;doubling the exports in that period&mdash;but I think it is quite realistic and achievable when we look at the market potential and the success that Australian companies are having. It is an example of how exports and services are delivering a more diversified and dynamic export sector, creating jobs in Australia where they can.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a very interesting interjection. Indeed, here we do go. First of all, other more up-to-date ABS statistics indicate that there has been no significant decline in the relative wages of women during that period of enterprise bargaining. Secondly, the government's Industrial Relations Act includes a range of safety net provisions, including an annual report to the Minister for Industrial Relations, to monitor enterprise bargaining, particularly its impact on women's wages. So that lower paid workers, many of whom are women, do not fall behind, the government will support the second and third safety net wage adjustments of $8 per week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for his question. The current textiles, clothing and footwear industries development strategy is due to be concluded in February in two years time&mdash;February 1996. Under the current industries development strategy, $160 million in financial assistance has been allocated to projects that have promoted industry restructuring and increased for this industry international competitiveness. As a result of this strategy, exports have increased by 85 per cent since 1987-88 to nearly $550 million. The industries have already set themselves the objective of quadrupling manufactured textile, clothing and footwear exports to $2 billion per year by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the key to sustaining the restructuring of the TCF industries is to increase the pace at which the industries focus on export opportunities. If this is to be achieved, the outward reorientation of TCF industries must continue. I am, therefore, pleased to announce the establishment of a textiles, clothing and footwear&mdash;TCF&mdash;future strategies committee to review the arrangements supporting the TCF industries and to report on the industries' growth prospects over the rest of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review is foreshadowed in the government's white paper on employment and growth. The review will form an important part of the government's consideration of what arrangements should be implemented when the existing TCF industry development strategy expires in February 1996. The review will ascertain the competitive position of Australia's TCF industries against international benchmarks. It will identify those strategies required to take advantage of the market opportunities arising from the industries' improved efficiency, and the opportunities arising from the international market as a result of the recently concluded Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. It will also provide a blueprint to assist the industries plan their own development over the next 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee comprising senior industry, union and public sector representatives will evaluate the industries' position and make recommendations to the government. I am particularly pleased to be able to report that a number of highly respected industry representatives have agreed to participate in this important review. They are Mr George Innes, a well-respected industrialist who for many years was in charge of Bond Industries; Mr Rod Mewing, the Managing Director of David Jones; and Mr Bill Mansfield, assistant secretary of the ACTU. Representatives of Austrade and the Department of Finance will also participate in the review to ensure that the federal government's services are completely integrated into the industry's future support measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review, which I expect will be seeking the views of all sections of industry, will be supported with all the necessary expert assistance. It will report to me early next year. This reporting date will ensure that the government will be able to indicate to the industries by mid-1995 what supporting arrangements they will be operating under after the conclusion of the present industries development strategy. A separate review of TCF tariffs will be conducted in 1996 with a view to recommending the rates to apply after the year 2000. I look forward to the review's findings, and I hereby table the review's terms of reference.</PARA>

I, too, refer to figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show that men's wages are growing almost twice as quickly as women's wages, and that the average weekly earnings of women have fallen relative to male earnings. I ask: does the minister agree that these figures also indicate that, compared with men, women will continue to have access to reduced superannuation payouts for many years to come for a whole range of reasons? In the light of these figures, which clearly show that women in the work force continue to suffer such disadvantage, will the government move to cancel or, at least, defer its proposal to progressively raise the pension age for women to 65?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a fair amount in that question. Firstly, I will simply repeat what I was just saying in answer to the previous question. On the advice provided to me, I urge a caution on how much can be read into&mdash;at least in 1994&mdash;the relative loss of income in women's wages as compared with men's. As I say, the advice provided to me says that other more up-to-date ABS statistics indicate that there has been no significant decline in the relative wages of women during the period of enterprise bargaining. It depends on which figures are read. I am told that more recent figures say that there is relatively no significant decline.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that I will do that as soon as I can.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of women's reduced superannuation does depend on whether or not Senator Kernot's claim on those figures is accurate. What is interesting is that since the government proposed changes in the superannuation area, women have access to superannuation that they did not have before. So, on the one hand, that is an increase. Senator Kernot's question on the fall of women's superannuation was premised on the fact that women's wages were falling behind. That, on the evidence provided to me, is not the case, so I cannot agree with Senator Kernot on that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot asked finally whether or not the government would, in the light of that possibility, be prepared to withdraw its proposal to move the age pension age for women out to 65. No. On no evidence to government is there any intention of removing that very slow phase-in of the extension of the age pension for women. The evidence given to the Senate committee examining this question the other day indicated that one should be cautious about this information. I have not seen the figures and special information that Senator Lees, for one, asked for at that Senate inquiry, and I have not seen the report from the committee, but on the evidence and advice I have, there is no intention by government to cease phasing in the age pension for women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the areas in which industry made representations to the government in its white paper initiatives was the improvement of the administration of the duty drawback scheme and the Texco scheme. The duty drawback scheme enables exporters who import goods which attract a tariff to re-export the manufactured good and draw back the duty paid. Texco is a scheme whereby approved manufacturers can get the concession up front. Industry had complained that the schemes were not well known, particularly by small and medium size enterprises, and that there were difficulties in administration. The government has accepted suggestions from industry and streamlined the procedures. We believe that the arrangements we have now put in place will put more emphasis on the Texco scheme&mdash;that is, people getting the concession up front as they import the good and not claiming it later on. We believe this will obviously be an advantage for business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I congratulate the minister for his recognition today of the importance of telecommunications equipment and services in the region. I presume, therefore, that he is very disturbed by the results of the recent international telephone price survey which found that Australia has the most expensive local telephone call prices out of a group of 12 leading developed nations. I also refer to the assessment by the outgoing chairman of the telecommunications regulator, Austel, that `the pressures of competition are not as great as they might be'. Why, therefore, has the government ruled out the one reform that would have the most advantageous impact on competition and consumer prices&mdash;namely, the privatisation of Telecom?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a matter of philosophy, there has never been, as far as I can tell, any evidence that merely selling a body from public to private ownership changes its efficiency. It is a question of whether there is competition. It is the competition that we have injected which those opposite had always refused to do because the National Party had them by the delicate parts. They would never do what we have done&mdash;that is, introduce competition into our system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications and the Arts is aware of a recent survey which contended that Australia has relatively high local call charges by world standards. But there are two fundamental flaws in that. It does not take into account, firstly, that Australia has among the largest local call zones in the world. Many calls that would be a local call here would be a long distance call in other countries. So that is a fundamental distinction that that survey fails to take into account. The second is that Australia has untimed local calls, which enables people to make very long local calls for just 25c from private residential telephones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same study&mdash;I did not hear Senator Alston mention this but I am sure he just overlooked it&mdash;shows that Australia ranks about middle for the cost of long distance calls and close to the cheapest for international calls, which is very important for many Australians, particularly those who come from other countries. We have improved our overall position for long distance calls. The introduction of competition is putting further pressure on prices and encouraging a broadening of service offerings and improved customer service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the competition and the efficiency that have been injected into the system are producing benefits for consumers. That is not to say there is nothing further that needs to be done, but there is not any evidence to say that merely selling one of the competitors would make the exercise more efficient or reduce the prices.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not yet seen the text of the Portuguese note verbale to which Senator Chamarette refers. The substance of it, in any event, is of course a matter for the two governments concerned and not the Australian government. As to the conference in the Philippines, which was apparently one of the subject matters of that note, I understand that it went ahead as scheduled at the University of Manila from 31 May to 4 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated in response to a question from Senator Bourne in this place on 30 May, our view, my view, is that it is disappointing that the controversy which arose between the Philippines and Indonesia over that conference was not able to be resolved in a way that would allow free debate to take place on a matter clearly of continuing international concern, and that it was not able to take place in a way that did not involve restrictions on freedom of international movement. But in my response to Senator Bourne I said that that issue was one between the Indonesian and Philippine governments, and that remains the Australian position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what we are doing on the larger question of East Timor, the situation is that we will continue our dialogue about our continuing concerns with the human rights situation in East Timor with the Indonesian government. We will continue that dialogue at the highest levels and we will also continue our dialogue with the international and Australian NGOs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the substance of what we are putting to the Indonesians in relation to East Timor so far as the Dili massacre is concerned, and unanswered questions about that particular massacre, I have persistently raised at the highest levels of the Indonesian government aspects of its response which continue to concern us. I have made clear our concern at the discrepancy in the sentences that were given out to military officers and civilians respectively. I have made clear in particular our continuing concern at the discrepancies in the accounts of those missing, urging the Indonesian government to make further efforts to clarify the situation. Our embassy in Jakarta continues to make regular representations to the relevant authorities on those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, what we are doing and what we are saying is making the case to the Indonesians for a major reduction and refocusing of the military presence in that province&mdash;the recognition in a number of different ways of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity. We have made points over and over again about the need not only for economic development in the province but for sensitive economic development, and we have also suggested that there may well be a case for a greater degree of local autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all those things, because we do take the view that human rights involve economic and social rights and not just civil and political rights, we have now in place a very substantial aid program for East Timor, amounting to some $30 million worth over the next five years, which is designed to assist the East Timorese through the provision of water supply and sanitation facilities, livestock and veterinary services, and rural planning. So I think in all those ways Australia has no apologies to make in terms of our continuing concern for the situation in East Timor.</PARA>

Why has the recovery in employment growth lasted only six months? Are Australia's nearly one million unemployed being left out in this `jobless recovery'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right. I am sure that Senator Schacht's answer is very illuminating as well, Mr President. Let me turn to the question. Employment has grown very rapidly in the last year, with 235,000 jobs being created in seasonally adjusted terms since April 1993. In part, the strength of the employment growth reflected a catch up following the strong growth in GDP. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the growth in vacancies and employment has slowed recently. Strong employment growth can be expected to resume in the coming months. In line with strong increases in GDP, sustained economic activity will support long-term growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling Senator Kemp the answer. He may not be interested but I am sure his colleague Senator Gibson is. While the ANZ Bank has reported that the rate of growth in its jobs advertisements series is slowing, it suggested in the press release attached to it that employment looks set to maintain moderate growth rates in coming quarters. We did not hear that from Senator Gibson in his question but he should get it right. I repeat that what the ANZ said in its press release was that employment looks set to maintain moderate growth rates in the coming quarters. That does not feed Senator Gibson's doom scene scenario that he has just given the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment grew strongly, as I have said, in late 1993 but only after a strong pick-up in economic activity in early 1993. Consistent with this catch-up pattern, employment growth had been expected to moderate in early 1994, despite strong growth in GDP. Given the very strong increases in economic activity in the December and March quarters of 1993-94, the medium term outlook for employment is for further strong growth. Employment growth will be sustained over 1994-95 by further increases in capacity and economic activity and a low inflationary environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, what I am saying, as can be seen from looking at the March quarter accounts, is that we have strong economic growth in the economy; we have low inflation in the economy; we virtually have as well an end to industrial disputation in the economy. On the Business Council's latest survey result, which was referred to by Senator Evans earlier in question time today, there has been a reinforcement of what the government has put forward in its budget for this year on expected investment uptakes. We have everything set for strong economic growth which, as the ANZ survey itself said in its qualifying note, will pull employment growth along with it as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refers to the Israeli military action in Lebanon. Is the government concerned that the Israeli raid last Thursday against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon's Beka'a Valley violates Lebanon's sovereignty, and what implications does this have for the Middle East peace process?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1375" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say at the outset that the government is, of course, concerned by any renewed outbreak of violence in the Middle East. We have said so on just about every other occasion in the past when such a major new escalation has occurred. So while the Australian government understands Israel's concerns, and always has, about security along its northern border, we consider that the attack last week by the Israeli air force on the Hezbollah training camp seriously compromises Lebanese sovereignty and that it was unhelpful, particularly at a time when the Lebanese government is clearly making renewed efforts to assert its authority domestically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As again I have said on many previous occasions, Australia supports the early implementation of Security Council resolution 425, which calls for Israel's immediate withdrawal from all Lebanese territory. We have repeatedly condemned attacks on Israel that have been launched from within Lebanon, and will continue to do so, but as a government we cannot endorse the continued presence of Israeli forces in the self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that while not in any way seeking to equate the status under which Syrian forces are present in Lebanon with that of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, nonetheless the Australian government considers, as I have said on many occasions, that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory would enhance Lebanese sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned that any escalation of violence of this kind by one party in the region does risk retaliation by others with obvious negative implications for the peace process negotiations as a whole. Already we have seen retaliatory rocket-launched attacks on civilian settlements in northern Israel, and it cannot be assumed that the cycle has yet run its course. On the other hand, there have been press reports that both Syria and Iran have been urging Hezbollah to exercise restraint in the wake of these attacks. If these reports, which we would of course welcome, are accurate and if Israel does avoid further military action in Lebanon, the potential damage to the peace process might be thus contained. We certainly very much hope that Syria and Lebanon would be prepared to isolate that recent violence in Lebanon from the peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peace process is now at a crucial juncture. The signs that genuine progress has been made have probably never been clearer. The international community is particularly gratified that the Palestinians have now taken control over Gaza and Jericho and that the new civil administration is beginning to function. In the other main bilateral track, Israel and Syria appear to have at last reached the stage of serious negotiations over a series of comprehensive proposals. Moreover, King Hussein's statement that Jordan will proceed in its negotiations with Israel independently of the progress made by other participants is also an encouraging development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, Australia will continue to do what we can to support the peace process both through the multilateral working groups of which we are a member and otherwise. Last October we announced a $15 million assistance package designed to engender support for the peace process. And I can say, finally, that the government is now in the process of examining whether we can make a financial contribution to the start-up costs of the new Palestinian authority.</PARA>

Successive governments in the immediate aftermath of 1975 did, of course, try very hard to establish the detailed circumstances of those executions and detailed protests, notwithstanding some suggestions that have been made to the contrary, were of course made at the time to the Indonesian government by the Australian government, expressing our very grave concern at what had happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important, while not forgetting some of the awful things that have happened, nonetheless to look to the future and, in particular, to understand the larger significance of our relationship with Indonesia. That does not mean sweeping under the carpet our concerns about the continuing human rights situation in East Timor, and I made clear in an earlier answer that neither I nor the Australian government have any disposition to do just that. But it is worth appreciating also this relationship with this country to our north, the fourth biggest in the world, with a population of nearly 190 million; a country of immense significance to our future both in security and strategic terms and in economic terms. This is a country with which it is very important that we have a balanced, sensible and full relationship.</PARA>

I think this question does reflect the line of questioning from Senator Kernot last week to Senator Evans, in which I thought Senator Evans cleared up the issue quite well. Some of the statistics I am asked to provide are unknowable. I think Senator Spindler has to acknowledge the categorisation that he has given me are fairly subjective and emotional, if not politically charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we in the government talk about opening the Australian economy to the world economy, we mean by that that we will encourage Australian companies to take strategic investment positions in industries in other economies, and there will be an encouragement too for some foreign investment to take strategic positions in Australia. What we are talking about here is integrating the Australian economy with the economy of the wider region and globally. We do not mean those words idly; we mean them as positive things. They bring virtues and growth, and greater trade and export opportunities to Australia when we do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the question referred to the budget forecast. The budget forecast for the 1994-95 financial year is for 14 1/2 per cent investment growth in Australia. It is not a forecast of what investment there will be by Australians in other economies; it is a forecast of investment growth in Australia. I should say that a lot of the money flowing from Australia to overseas investment propositions goes to projects or things of that nature which are themselves internationally competitive and would go ahead in their own right whether or not Australian companies took a position in them. The fact that Australian companies take an investment position in them means that it strengthens our export ties, it strengthens the repatriation of profits from those successful enterprises to Australia, and helps balance our foreign debt as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that it is not in the interests of Australia to try to do everything that can possibly be done in Australia. Other economies have strengths and it is for us to take advantage by wise investment in those strengths so that by those economies working together the outcome is far better than it would be if we were working in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of the last question is that perhaps we should have some sort of regulation of Australian investment overseas. Even if that were something that the government thought desirable, which it does not, I do not think that such an idea in the modern day internationalisation of the Australian economy is at all feasible either. As I have said, outward investment allows Australian businesses and institutions to find best use of their funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concluding remark I make is that when we talk about Australian investment overseas there are some industries&mdash;service industries in the main&mdash;which do not export but need to take a position in a foreign market. For example, banking and transport need to invest on the ground in those other markets in order to expand the industry. That sort of investment is quite proper and I commend the companies that are doing it.

Is it true that the federal government has stopped funding the wet tropics tree planting scheme, threatening 35 jobs and $1 million worth of infrastructure? Has this scheme been stopped because the federal government cannot secure matching funding for the Daintree rescue package from the Queensland government&mdash;the matching funding upon which the government's grant of $11.1 million was conditional?

The fact of the matter is that an independent private sector valuer, whose area of expertise is valuing hotels, made a decision that the valuation was $825,000. Therefore, the objective which I set for the department when I was minister was that it should get the best price for a use consistent with the planning guidelines in the ACT. The planning guidelines in the ACT do not allow this building to continue to be used as an office, so all those valuations for office purposes are not allowed by the NCPA guidelines for this building.

This provision may be relevant to a limited number of environmental laws which require licences for the carrying out of particular activities. Of course, if an activity is totally prohibited and there is no question of people being allowed to do it with a licence, native title holders cannot rely on section 211. They are totally prohibited as well from killing the particular endangered species animal, or whatever, that might be the subject of such a law.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport has provided the following information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of factors have contributed to delays in the One Nation rail infrastructure program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the conditions of the One Nation rail program announced in February 1992 was that firm commitments be obtained from the rail unions to support a "greenfields" enterprise award for National Rail (NR). Negotiations commenced in February 1992 and were completed at the end of July that year, which opened the way for the approval of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original intention of the One Nation program was that rail authorities would be responsible for project management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, by mid 1992 it became apparent that the rail authorities were not in position to do this, and NR assumed carriage of the program, producing an overall program plan, and began to issue timetables, project plans and tender documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NR examined all projects to determine that plans, designs and timetables were feasible and warranted. As a result, the scope of a number of projects, such as rail freight access to Sydney, were modified. These necessary changes resulted in delays to project construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Melbourne-Adelaide gauge conversion project was delayed by negotiations with the Victorian Government about the route and scope of the project, and responsibility for costs in respect of branch lines affected by the conversion. Resolution of these issues was not finalised until early 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994/95 Budget estimate for the One National Rail infrastructure program is $127.6 million, which represents the level of under expenditure against the original estimate of expenditure to 30 June 1994, as announced in February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delays in planning and design which have affected the rate of expenditure over 1992/93 and 1993/94 also obviously have effected the rate at which jobs have been created.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ian Macdonald this day, relating to conservation funding for the Daintree rainforest.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Faulkner's answer, and the way the Labor Party has dealt with the environment and the environment movement, is typical of the duplicity of the Labor Party when it comes to conservation and environment matters. In the budget, the Labor Party government allocated $11.1 million for a Daintree rescue package. That was delivered with much fanfare. It was a sign that the Labor Party was again realising the importance of the green vote and the importance of getting that environmental vote on its side, and there was a huge amount of fanfare for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget, that funding of $11.1 million was not absolute. It was conditional upon matching funding by the Queensland government. Did the federal government, and did this minister, make any attempt to speak to the Queensland government about matching funding? I can only quote the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Federal Government's pledge to fund a Daintree rescue package came a bit too late for inclusion in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The Queensland government was not approached in sufficient time to enable it to commit these funds so that the condition precedent by the federal government to allow $11.1 million for the Daintree rescue package could be dealt with in the Queensland budget. It shows the absolute incompetence of this government and, I regret to say, the new minister, that these sort of details were not developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government continues with its budget announcement that the giving of $11.1 million for the Daintree rescue package is conditional upon funding by the Queensland government, it would appear that the $11.1 million from the federal government will not have to be paid and the Daintree rescue package may well fall by the wayside. Again, this shows the contempt with which the Labor Party treats the environment movement. It is tremendous for getting votes at election time but when it comes to serious commitments to the environment and conservation we find the Labor Party sadly lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similar to the other element that I raised in my question. Back in the days when the Labor Party took away the jobs of workers on the Atherton Tablelands in the Far North Queensland region&mdash;actually took away their jobs in the timber industry; an industry which had been going for over 100 years&mdash;it made a series of promises to these workers. It promised, `We will make sure that no person suffers as a result of the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics; no worker&mdash;no person&mdash;will be disadvantaged by it.' Time and again in this parliament we have been through how that promise converted into throwing $7 million of taxpayers' money to a company which, to say the least, was badly run, and that money simply went away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some subsidiary schemes put into place and the scheme I mentioned in my question, the wet tropics tree planting scheme, was one of those. These workers were promised jobs in schemes such as this and other schemes which the federal government would fund. But we only have to go to the Ravenshoe and the Atherton Tablelands area to see the results of this government's management of that wet tropics heritage listing. No-one denies that the wet tropics should have been listed, but the way it was gone about, the management of it, the way the boundaries were drawn, is something that will forever haunt this government and something that it should forever be mindful of. The promises were made&mdash;the government was committed for a couple of years&mdash;but today we find that this scheme has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has given some lame excuse about him talking to Senator Collins about funding it, but why did they not do it before the scheme finished? Why was it not announced in this budget rather than the minister lamely saying that he is going to talk to the minister about it and he hopes to make a positive announcement in the next few weeks? If he makes a positive announcement, where is he going to get the money from, because it has not been budgeted for? It is simply more Labor Party talk, more hyperbole, more promises to workers and environmentalists in the region which the Labor Party will never honour. It will be only when votes are needed that the government will again find its interest in the environment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in answer to the silly question that was asked by Senator Macdonald during question time, funding was provided for a three-year structural adjustment package for the wet tropics tree planting scheme. It is true that funding for that particular package concludes on 30 June this year. I did indicate to the Senate that I had had extensive discussions with Minister Collins and Minister Crean about this particular scheme because I consider that the work being undertaken in relation to this tree planting scheme is very important. Obviously, significant infrastructure is being established in those local government areas where the scheme is operating. I want to look at all possible options to see whether this work could continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the public debate on either of these matters is assisted by absurd questions, such as the ones asked by Senator Macdonald, being progressed in this particular forum.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not true to say, as Senator Macdonald indicated, that everyone supports World Heritage listings such as the World Heritage listing of the Queensland wet tropics. In fact, the conservative parties of Australia are riddled with people who oppose World Heritage listings and they are riddled with people who oppose the World Heritage listing of the Queensland wet tropics. So, if someone like Senator Ian Macdonald is going to give us a history lesson, he should get his facts right because every person in this chamber knows the absolutely abysmal record of the coalition and of the Liberal Party in terms of protection of the environment in this country and protection of our World Heritage areas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is in keeping with a long tradition of parliamentary action by the Australian Democrats against the advertising of tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition (Broadcasting and Tobacco Advertising Legislation) Amendment Bill 1994 introduces two significant measures which will further contribute to the improved health of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the bill revives Senator Janet Powell's private senator's bill of 1990 which sought to amend the Broadcasting Act to prohibit the incidental broadcasting of tobacco advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill repeals provisions in the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act which currently enable the advertising of tobacco products at major Australian cultural and sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 17,000 Australians lose their lives each year as a consequence of tobacco related illnesses and the medical and health costs to the Australian community are enormous. There is absolutely no doubt that cigarette smoking is our number one health problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The link between cigarette advertising and young people taking up smoking is well documented. It is a link which is recognised by the World Health Organisation and by all leading health organisations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Studies conducted both here and in the United States and the United Kingdom have shown that advertising at and sponsorship of sporting events is seen in a positive light by children and that it plays a role in the uptake of smoking by children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has acknowledged this link. In 1976, the Federal Government introduced a ban on cigarette advertising in the electronic media. That was followed many years later in 1989 by the Government&mdash;in an historic parliamentary first&mdash;taking up Senator Powell's private senator's bill and moving to ban cigarette advertising in the print media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Government has never taken the final step and moved to a total ban on tobacco advertising. This bill takes that final step. It is designed to close the door once and for all on all forms of cigarette advertising and it is designed to prevent young people and children from becoming the target of cigarette advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill recognises that there is no safe level or form of tobacco use. It acknowledges that there are many other legal products which cannot be advertised because of the risks associated with those products and it rejects the claim that advertising is targeted at encouraging people to maintain brand loyalty or to switch brands rather than take up smoking in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill addresses two major deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It closes a loophole in the Broadcasting Act which continues to allow the incidental broadcasting of tobacco advertising&mdash;that is, any matter which includes a trade mark, brand name or logo associated with cigarettes or tobacco products. It would still permit the broadcasting of that material which occurred accidentally or in the initial coverage of events which took place overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This loophole allows tobacco companies to promote their products through sponsorship, through the exposure of their name associated with major events or major organisations, and through the broadcasting of brand names and logos as part of television coverage of sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to close this loophole because it has clearly provided tobacco companies with the means to circumvent the ban on advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1990, Senator Powell introduced a private senator's bill to close this loophole. She did so after the Government and the Coalition (with the exception of Senators Peter Baume, Herron and Archer) voted against her amendments to the Broadcasting Act&mdash;amendments which would have had the same effect as this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator Powell pointed out when she introduced her bill, tobacco companies are not in the business of sporting philanthropy&mdash;they are in the business of creating advertising opportunities and expanding the market for their products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In her second reading speech, Senator Powell went on to discuss in some detail how effective tobacco companies have been in exploiting the loophole in the Broadcasting Act&mdash;and things have not improved in the four years since her bill was tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviving Senator Powell's bill, I am not only paying a tribute to her efforts in this area over the years, I am also introducing an important piece of legislation which will send a clear signal to tobacco industry that we will fulfil our obligations to young Australians and move to totally ban the advertising of tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of this bill will repeal section 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. This is the section under which sporting and cultural events can be granted exemptions from the provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill would bring to an end the discretion to grant an exemption from the Act. It would make it a non-issue. No-one would be able to put pressure on the Minister or the Government to grant an exemption because no-one would be able to apply for an exemption in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Act was passed, six exemptions have been granted: to the Australian Formula One Grand Prix, the Australian Motor Cycle Grand Prix, the Australian Ladies Masters, the Telecom Rally Australia, the Whitbread Around the World Yacht Race and the Australian Challenge for the America's Cup.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that these events&mdash;which attract significant television coverage&mdash;have been used to promote and advertise tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not good enough to claim that these events are "one-offs" which will have not act as incentive for people to take up smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know that tobacco sponsorship of major sporting events has a significant impact on young people, in particular, taking up smoking. That is precisely the reason tobacco companies associate themselves and their products with these events. That is the reason they associate their products with healthy lifestyles and sporting events and sporting heroes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people look up to these athletes and sportspeople&mdash;what sort of message are we giving young people when they see their sporting heroes being part of advertising campaigns for a product which is killing more than 17,000 Australian every year?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When tobacco companies sponsor sporting events, it also limits the capacity of sportspeople to speak out against tobacco and cigarette smoking. I cannot imagine there are too many international sportspeople who also smoke&mdash;after all, tobacco is not exactly a performance enhancer&mdash;but financial and contractual obligations to tobacco companies have been very effective in preventing sportspeople from getting an anti-smoking message across to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of us can remember when one of those sporting heroes, cricketer Greg Matthews, spoke out against cigarette smoking and was promptly fined by the Australian Cricket Board. Although Greg Matthews was widely praised for his actions, he lost three months' pay as a consequence of breaching a clause in his contract which said he was not allowed to speak out against tobacco or cigarettes because of the Australian Cricket Board's commitment to the Benson &amp; Hedges company. What sort of message did that send to young people and children?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe we should tolerate "half measures" in this matter. Either we decide to prohibit the advertising of tobacco products or we don't. There is little point in moving to "ban" advertising if we then allow tobacco sponsorship and incidental advertising and exemptions for particular sporting or cultural events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaving those gaps and loopholes open means we are simply inviting tobacco companies to climb right through them. We might as well have no ban at all. We may have closed off some of the more obvious channels for tobacco advertising , but we are still giving the tobacco companies ample opportunity to promote their product in conjunction with the sorts of events and activities which appeal to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill closes down those opportunities once and for all. It says very clearly and unequivocally that Australia is not a place where tobacco companies can advertise their product in any way, shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are alternatives to tobacco sponsorship of sport and is time those organisations still relying upon tobacco industry money started exploring those alternatives. It is time the Federal Government looked at the experiences of South Australia and Victoria in replacing tobacco advertising and sponsorship through the establishment of Foundation SA and the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have called for the establishment of a national Sport and Health Promotion Fund to replace tobacco sponsorship of sport. We have suggested that such a Fund could be financed by an increase in tobacco excise of 80c/kilo, raising $20 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund would also direct funds towards ensuring continued recognition for non-Olympic and "lower profile" sports and, as with Vic-Health and Foundation SA, it would have a clear brief for health promotion, linking positive health messages with sports sponsorship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Replacing tobacco sponsorship of sport is the direction in which we should be heading. In closing the door on incidental advertising and removing the possibility of any exemptions being granted, this bill provides an added impetus at a federal level to set off firmly in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Child Support Agency was established in the Australian Taxation Office in 1988 to collect child support payments from liable parents. In my electorate this has been one of the major problems without satisfactory resolution. In fact, in my electorate office we have had a totally unacceptable failure rate in dealing with constituents who are genuinely aggrieved about the failures of this operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure rate is clearly too high. But this Auditor-General's report is not aimed at examining the whole scheme; its object is to assess the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of the management of the Child Support Agency. At this stage, as the Auditor-General points out, other participants in this scheme, such as the Department of Social Security and the Attorney-General's Department, have not been audited. There is no doubt that most of the failures are undoubtedly occurring where the scheme is simply being ignored and where the Australian Taxation Office is incapable of pursuing matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to note that there have been some successes&mdash;it would be unfair to suggest that the thing was a total disaster. While there are, of course, some successes&mdash;the agency collected something like $200 million from liable parents in 1992-93&mdash;the fact is that the agency, which operates through Australian Taxation Office branches and employs about 1,000 staff, spent something like $56 million in collecting this $200 million. As at June 1993, the case load was almost 200,000 and has continued to increase rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that the collections costs incurred on behalf of supporting parents&mdash;which, by the way, means taking that burden off the taxpayer and putting it on the non-supporting parents, the liable parents&mdash;are something like 25 per cent of the total amount collected. That seems to be an extraordinarily large proportion. In reading the Auditor-General's report, there is no doubt a need for far greater spending to make it work better. I might say that those expenditures are simply in the Australian Taxation Office and do not take into account expenditure in Social Security and the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is quite clear to me&mdash;and the Auditor-General makes the point&mdash;that a lot of the shortcomings outlined in 1991 by Mr Justice Fogarty's report still exist and are some kind of an impediment to the provision of an efficient service. I am very glad that just two months ago the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) announced changes to the child support scheme. The Auditor-General notes that implementation of these changes should make a positive contribution in dealing with the problems identified; but I do not think anyone is suggesting they will, in fact, solve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the problems established by the Auditor-General in just that section of the scheme&mdash;which, I suppose, is the sharp end of it&mdash;run by the Australian Taxation Office with the object of collecting child support payments from liable parents. The Auditor-General's summary states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audit findings indicated an unsatisfactory standard of client service. Problems with control and reporting systems&mdash;particularly in the area of debtors management and collection&mdash;and in inconsistency of procedures between branches were impediments to performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSA accepted most of the recommendations made by the ANAO. The Agency responded, however, that some recommendations were for procedures already adopted and that action was in hand to deal with many of the matters raised. In some cases&mdash;such as arrears of enforcement&mdash;the CSA acknowledged the problem but said that a lack of resources was limiting action.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why say it is going to cost more than $56 million to collect $200 million if the proper procedures are adopted, unless there is some basic change in the way we go about it. The major outcomes of this audit, according to the report, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unacceptably difficult for CSA clients to contact the Agency by telephone and there were excessive delays in dealing with correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the experience that my staff and I have had in my office, I say amen to all that. It is not difficult: it is impossible; it is hopeless; it is a ridiculous situation. I think the Auditor-General is being very polite in saying `it was unacceptably difficult.' The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management of debtors was unsatisfactory. Reporting of debtors was inadequate and misleading. Tracing of debtors was ineffective and ad hoc. Procedures for interception of tax refunds to defaulting debtors were inconsistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO believes that in a devolved environment there should be a high level of national co-ordination and direction within the Agency to identify best practice, focus efforts for best results and to ensure equitable and consistent treatment of clients.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems extraordinary to me that these things should have to be pointed out to the agency, but obviously the Taxation Office has not applied its mind enough to this matter, and I believe it should. This is a very serious and significant matter affecting a very large number of people who are not in a financial situation adequately to cope with being mucked around by a system that is not serving them as it was designed to serve them. The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Client communication was of particular concern. Improvements are required in telephone facilities and staffing arrangements. There were also excessive delays in dealing with correspondence. Correspondence and notices to clients should be reviewed to reduce the need for client contact to clarify matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! Let us have less obscure correspondence and let us have letters that say what they mean. On the management of debtors, the Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommended a number of improvements in the reporting and management of debtors. Arrears of tracing and collection action were of particular concern. Other matters referred to included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">form and content of debtors reports</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">monitoring of debtor performance</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">action on high value debts</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">application of default penalties</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office suggested that there was scope for a greater role for CSA National Office in control and coordination. Matters referred to included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Identification and implementation of best practices</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistency of practices between branches</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Usefulness of reports</PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal with the consistency of practices between branches. It seems to be one of the problems affecting the tax office that in all its manifestations there are extraordinarily different procedures and judgments, and extraordinarily different attitudes to the same subjects and problems depending on where one happens to be. We find a taxpayer being severely dealt with in one tax office for undertaking a procedure that is quite acceptable to another. Quite frankly, that is intolerable. We have the same sort of situation emerging with the Child Support Agency element of the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General goes on to refer to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Usefulness of reports to branch management in identifying progress against performance indicators</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reporting and analysis of significant variations from targeted performance.</PARA>
<PARA>It is further suggested that there is a need for the establishment of protocols for working arrangements between the Department of Social Security and the Child Support Agency. There must be the fullest cooperation, particularly with computer services, between these two agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if the Auditor-General's recommendations are enthusiastically pursued, we will see an improvement in the standard of service to people who are heavily financially dependent on the effectiveness of the operations of the Child Support Agency. I would encourage whoever is responsible to proceed to examine the roles of the Department of Social Security and the Attorney-General's Department in cooperating with the Child Support Agency in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, it is unfortunate that the Auditor-General's report is of necessity limited to the Australian Taxation Office element of this operation. It is an operation of major significance to a whole heap of Australians. As I said, there is already a case load of 200,000 people and that is steadily mounting. I urge the government to do what it can to fix this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the three months that I have been a senator and in my time before that as a legal practitioner, I can confirm that the child support assessment scheme has caused some very real problems for a lot of Australians. It is most unfortunate that the aggravation that this scheme has given these people is above and beyond what one might normally expect from a bureaucracy of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trauma that it adds to what is already an aggravating situation is most concerning to me because the participants in the child support scheme are usually still smarting from the collapse and failure of the relationship which has brought about their involvement with the Child Support Agency. After their personal trauma they are confronted with the bureaucratic structure which does not deal with them as individuals with individual needs but as part of the scheme. That is borne out by this report, which makes a number of comments about the operation of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the summary, dealing with public concerns, the situation is, I think, kindly and mildly stated. It points out that the Child Support Agency commenced operation in 1988 and that since then it has achieved `some success' in collecting and transferring child support payments from non-custodial to custodial parents. One would hope that after some five years it would be in full swing and operating to great effectiveness to ensure that the children of relationships are properly cared for and that appropriate responsibility is taken for the children by the non-custodial parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, the Auditor-General found that the Child Support Agency management was not sufficiently directed and that there was excessive latitude. My friend and colleague Senator Baume has already dealt with that matter so I will pass over it, saying no more than that I agree with his comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General goes on to tell us that he was concerned that the Child Support Agency's internal reports of apparently unanswered correspondence were more of a resource justification for section staff than a trigger for vigorous action. It was found that, under present arrangements, some correspondence will never be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is clearly unacceptable because, whether the correspondence that the Child Support Agency receives is based on a proper understanding of the way the system operates or not, the simple fact is that Australians have taken the time to write to the Child Support Agency with their concerns about its operation or its application to them as individuals. For the Child Support Agency to have an arrangement in place whereby it specifically provides that some correspondence will never be answered is, in my view, an arrogant disregard of those people who genuinely believe that they have a proper and legitimate complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that, after consideration and a due and proper response, the people who write in are of the view that they should not pursue their complaint or concern any further. That would provide for a better understanding of the whole child support system within the community at large. But to simply disregard people and treat them so arrogantly is a very poor reflection on the operations of the Child Support Agency. When people such as myself have had to deal at the coalface with people who are so frustrated with the bureaucracy of the Child Support Agency, it is incumbent on the Child Support Agency to consider putting people first and consider the human element as the top priority in dealing with the complaints and correspondence that it receives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that the government will be considering this report in light of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which, as I understand it, is due to be tabled in a few months time. I hope that with these two reports we will be able to see a situation whereby the Child Support Agency not only operates for the benefit of the children whom it was designed to assist but also looks after the providers of the money&mdash;namely, the non-custodial parents&mdash;and make sure that the custodial parents get their money quickly and efficiently and without unnecessary delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that this bureaucratic structure is adding further heartache to the trauma of the break-up of family relationships. It is clear that urgent action is required and I hope that, with the family law report coming down in August, this matter will be cleared up to ensure that the agency, which has been in operation in excess of five years, will get its act together and deliver its services in a proper and caring way to all those who are unfortunate enough to require them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not agree with a lot of things that Senator Coulter says, but there is nobody in the Senate who has a greater interest in the science community than Senator Coulter; nobody has a greater knowledge of the science community, particularly in relation to the work being done by the CSIRO. It is only natural that a person of Senator Coulter's standing has particular contacts with people in science. A lot of effort was put into making sure that the wording of the amendments moved by Senator Coulter was well thought out and would be in the best interests of the CSIRO, the science community and the people involved in rural research, which is what we are most concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech yesterday Senator Cook went on to say that he was concerned that persons from the CSIRO should not be talking to members of parliament; if they did so, then someone else should be present to take notes. Yesterday Senator Coulter likened this practice to something we would expect to find in Stalinist Russia. It was further suggested yesterday that perhaps somebody from the minister's politburo had to be on hand to make sure that the people who were involved in discussions with parliamentarians were passing on the right thoughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astounded by the minister's reply yesterday. I was astounded to learn that people elected to this place cannot have discussions with appointees to these positions without fear or favour. I was concerned when Senator Cook, referring to senators on this side of the chamber, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They come from agricultural Australia. What we are seeing here is politicians on the backbench of their party pursuing their own self-interests. . . I could say to Senator Panizza that he may want to drag the CSIRO into this debate in order to enhance his political reputation and  serve his own precious little self-interest group in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>If I were Senator Panizza I would take offence at that. I support Senator Panizza because those of us who know him well and have seen his actions in this place know that he is not one who is inclined merely to serve small interest groups. Senator Panizza supports what he believes is to the general benefit of the Australian community, and in particular the agricultural community of which he is a part. Over the years Senator Panizza has seen the agricultural community make a tremendous input into the economy of this country, particularly by way of exports. I thought it was particularly unfair of the minister to accuse Senator Panizza of only pandering to self-interest groups when we all know that Senator Panizza only does what he believes is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why the minister is so concerned about a full and frank inquiry being conducted into the CSIRO. A lot of questions require answering. A Senate inquiry would enable people to put their cards on the table and discuss things that are of concern to the CSIRO. CSIRO is held in very high regard by people who have benefited from its advice. The work that CSIRO has performed for this country for many years has been welcome and appreciated, and any cutback in its scientific work would be to the detriment of those people it is designed to serve most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments moved refer to the sources and adequacy of funding. We must bear in mind that we are not only talking about government funding; the rural industry itself puts a tremendous amount of money into the CSIRO.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion by Senator Panizza and the amendment from Senator Coulter. I do this against the background of one of the most extraordinary performances we are ever likely to see in this place by a minister. Yesterday the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) lost control of himself. If we were to ask people who watched what occurred yesterday about it, they would say that the minister lost his bananas because he really got off the beaten track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I want to deal with, and make some further comments on, in terms of this motion is the restrictions that have been placed around access to personnel within CSIRO. One can well understand that if a person is being briefed on legislation by a department with the authority and permission of a minister an observer could be present or, to put it in Senator Cook's words, an independent note taker. I certainly do not regard one of Senator Cook's staff as an independent note taker. In fact, I think it is a nonsense to even suggest that. I would suggest that the behaviour we saw yesterday, which Senator Coulter referred to as something akin to Stalinist Russia, would have fitted well into the Gestapo in Hitler's regime. That is how pathetic, stupid and inappropriate it was in terms of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with some of the things that were said yesterday, and in coming to the substance of this recommendation, Senator Cook slated people on this side of the chamber and said that they should have used the estimates committee procedure, which is the place for this particular debate. There is no doubt that estimates committees have a place in terms of the functioning of this place, but they are not the only place&mdash;they are not the be-all and end-all. The place to finally determine whether or not there should be a reference to a Senate committee on any aspects in this case of an inquiry into the CSIRO quite rightly is this place. The minister was absolutely and totally wrong in his assertion with regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the minister's criticisms when he said that we `introduce out of the blue motions such as this because the mood seizes us'. This motion did not come out of the blue. It did not suddenly descend upon Senator Panizza, Senator Coulter or any of the rest of us who are supporting it. This motion came out of consistent concerns that were being expressed by a number of people within CSIRO and a number from outside the CSIRO&mdash;in other words, the receivers of the benefits of CSIRO and its research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on the public record as being a very strong supporter of the work that CSIRO has done. In fact, I spoke about it yesterday when speaking on the Auditor-General's report. I highlighted a number of aspects that came out of that and mentioned some of the roles of the CSIRO, particularly in terms of the practical side of its research and how applicable it has been. Nonetheless, that does not mean that we do not from time to time have this Senate, or a committee of this Senate, look at those particular operations to establish that they are working to the best advantage, or to establish that the policies being adopted by the government in terms of the CSIRO's future are the correct ones and to highlight the benefits that accrue from the work that it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight one particular aspect from the outside. I have here a letter from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association. It was sent to Mr Drysdale, Chairman of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA>This is not something that has come out of a dream world, something that has suddenly been thought up as the mood possessed us. It is a concern of an industry organisation in Western Australia about this aspect of it. It is something that we not only have a right to respond to in this place in an appropriate manner, but also should respond to in this place in an appropriate matter. Therefore, I reject absolutely and totally the assertions that were made by the minister yesterday as far as this subject is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really highlights the concern when an organisation starts talking about taking out a caveat to prevent something happening because it is concerned about it and has not been properly informed about it. I believe that we should act in a very positive and strong matter. That is what this motion is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two or three other points that I would like to pick up in terms of what the minister said yesterday. I want to note that we on this side of the chamber are well aware of the objectives of the CSIRO as they are spelt out in the Science and Industry Research Act. We did not need a little person's school lecture from the minister on this point because many of us take a close interest in it, and have for a long time. In his speech yesterday the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why I ask, when the organisation is functioning properly and responsibly, having regard to external consultancy advice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And of course he went on. While I have covered most of this in my earlier comments, I want to say that the concern out in the general community about the current direction of CSIRO and what is happening puts a question mark around the organisational functioning. Of course, that is dealt with in the first point of Senator Coulter's amendment. The minister went on to have a shot at the opposition and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are seeing here is politicians on the backbench of their party pursuing their own self-interests about what they think ought to be the priorities of the CSIRO; not a consideration of the scientific needs of this nation and not an external review to get the best advice to see how we can set those goals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I find those comments absolutely insulting. I am sure Senator Panizza&mdash;I can speak for him on this&mdash;equally finds them insulting, because we are people who have taken a keen interest in this. I have an understanding of Senator Coulter's attitude to science and what have you, without being somebody who has been very close to him in terms of this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister comes into this place and makes that sort of comment, he would well do himself a favour if he came back in here and withdrew it because it is absolutely and totally wrong. Not only is it wrong; it is very unfair. It belittles the approach that has been adopted on this side of the chamber with regard to the CSIRO and other research which, in most instances, I might add, has not been very different from the government's position. In fact, it has been very close to the government's position in most instances. To come in here and try to score political points like that because he has made a blue in terms of the pressure that he put on the CSIRO demonstrates absolutely and totally that he has lost control of his portfolio and the presentation of it. I totally and absolutely reject the insinuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with another point which I think is very important in this total debate; that is, the continuing emphasis that is placed on the 40 per cent that is spent on rural research. That is absolutely true, nobody is arguing about that. What needs also to be said is that approximately half of that money is provided by the agricultural industry itself. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture in this country has an exceptionally proud record for its contribution to research&mdash;an unparalleled record in the world. That is one of the reasons why the CSIRO and other institutions such as the department of agriculture have such a good, proud record of results. They have been industry and need driven. As soon as Senator Cook wakes up to that fact, he will be able to address the aspects we are dealing with now far more rationally and in a much more sensible manner. Senator Cook then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the coalition to pretend that the CSIRO does not focus itself on research and development in rural Australia is to argue that the priorities of the other sectors should be relegated further than they are.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no idea where the minister gets that notion from. I have never heard it argued in this place; in fact, I have never heard it argued anywhere. As an individual who has taken a close interest in this particular aspect of it, because I am fully aware of the benefits of the work that has been done, I cannot understand why Senator Cook would want to come into this place and misrepresent the true situation. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it does reflect on the management, no matter how those opposite might pretend otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an equally stupid statement. It could well enhance the position of management. It could&mdash;in fact, I believe it will&mdash;give management the type of support that is required for it to continue with the magnificent work that it has done in the past. We go on through Senator Cook's speech. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot have a snapshot from the 1930s or a snapshot from the 1950s and say that things were set then; agricultural funding got almost all the money, therefore it must continue for ever and a day to get all the money.</PARA>
<PARA>It is just a pity that Senator Cook did not bother to read carefully Senator Panizza's motion and Senator Coulter's amendment. If he had read them carefully, he would never have made such a comment. Once again, it is a total misrepresentation of what Senator Panizza's motion is about and a total misrepresentation of what Senator Coulter's amendment is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some justifications for concern with regard to what is happening with the CSIRO, not the least being the reduction from 27 sites to 17 sites of applicable stations from which to operate. While there may be some grounds for consolidation&mdash;and I am not going to argue against that in some areas&mdash;it is important that research be done across as wide a spectrum as possible. When we consider the CSIRO's activities, 27 sites around the states of Australia are not really very many sites. To reduce them to 17, obviously makes the number far fewer. It will enormously reduce its capacity to be able to carry out the wide-ranging practical research&mdash;we must underline the word `practical'&mdash;into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something that this Senate, through its Senate committee structure, has every right to examine. This committee will not be interfering with the restructuring process which is going on in the CSIRO. While some of us are concerned about that, we are also mature enough to look at it realistically and sensibly, which is more than I can say about Minister Cook. </PARA>
<PARA>The other concern is that there will only be a reduction of three scientists. While I have heard that said, I do not have an exact figure myself, and I hope this inquiry will find out precisely what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard figures for reductions quoted, ranging from 120 to 240 in support staff. The minister in his speech mentioned 143. Obviously, if there is going to be that sort of reduction in the number of support staff required for the scientists to carry out their work, it will have an enormous impact on the capacity of that organisation to continue to do what it has done in the past as well as it has done in the past. Once again, I emphasise the point that we have every right to bring these things into this chamber. We have every right to put them forward for consideration as a matter of inquiry by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch on one other aspect which I think is a very positive point that was made in the Auditor-General's report. Return on investment in the various operations of the CSIRO and its practical research ranges from 18 per cent to in excess of 100 per cent. Certainly, as an individual and one who also has to declare an interest in this&mdash;even though we filled out our forms recently, I have to declare any interest in an operating property which uses that particular research&mdash;I believe there is no doubt that without the efforts of the CSIRO and others as I have mentioned, Australia would not have been able to maintain the competitive edge that it has in most agricultural fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at this whole issue, by and large, I not only support Senator Panizza for having brought this forward, I also congratulate him. I congratulate Senator Coulter for his input to the motion which I believe will be carried in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by re-emphasising a couple of points. The first is a very important aspect of the whole research effort in agriculture in this country. We are leaders in the world because of the contribution and commitment by industry and the direction that has come from the corporations on research effort. Certainly, in the restructuring of that, I acknowledge, without any problem at all, the role that John Kerin played as the previous minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I absolutely and totally reject the attitude adopted by Minister Cook in this place yesterday. I appeal to those who are a little more level-headed and a little cooler in their application&mdash;and I include Senator Collins in this&mdash;to remove this impediment, this barrier, to the accessibility of members on this side of the chamber to scientists or personnel from the CSIRO to have meaningful discussions with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of anything more ridiculous than going back to Western Australia and, when I want to go to the CSIRO station in Perth or elsewhere, having to get permission and having to get an independent notetaker&mdash;as it has been put&mdash;to come along and observe our discussions.

If we add up all the figures, we find that the total amount of money in the 1993-94 financial year devoted to rural research in Australia is $700 million, of which the Commonwealth is contributing over half. It is a fact that that is a record level of funding for rural research in Australia, and the Commonwealth contribution alone has doubled in real terms since 1984-85.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out the hypocrisy of the opposition in continuing to talk about just throwing more money at this, that and the other when at the same time it is talking about reducing the deficit. It is also instructive to have a look at the brilliant position that we inherited from those opposite when we took office because the comparison is stark. When Labor came to power in 1983 it inherited, in the words of John Kerin, an unworkable and paternalistic set of arrangements. There was a series of research councils that had no autonomy, no capacity to make even the most minor decision without the direct, specific approval of the minister. There was no basis for decision making other than an ad hoc, individual, case by case decision by the minister. The organisations had no autonomy whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just how much funding was the coalition government putting into research and development? I will tell honourable senators. It was putting in $30 million in 1982. These people who are now castigating us&mdash;the representatives of the farmers, they tell us; the people who represent, according to them, rural Australia&mdash;about investing record levels of money into rural research and development were financing rural research and development to the brilliant total of $30 million. We overhauled that and brought it up to the level that it is at today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that the Senate has expressed an interest in rural research and development. There was an investigation into it in 1982 by the Senate. The Senate committee that reviewed rural research in 1982 described this brilliant commitment by the coalition as `appalling'. It expressed `alarm' at the continuing real decline in the coalition's funding of rural research and development. The committee noted that it was disappointing that real funding to rural industry research had fallen from $40 million in 1974-75 to $30 million in 1980-81&mdash;all of those, of course, years of coalition government. These are the same people who are in here now castigating us for the record levels of funding that we are putting into rural research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our response was to put in place industry based research and development corporations, which I have said on many occasions before is one of the best things that I think this Labor government did in those years in relation to primary industry and energy.

Senator Panizza would do well to read the substance of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been changing priorities in agricultural research. They are not set in concrete. These priorities do change, and the research organisations that carry them out have to change to reflect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the last point is research into poultry production.The Chicken Meat Research and Development Council has advised CSIRO that much of the research that is being been carried out is no longer required as the industry is moving toward importing genetic material and, therefore, the research direction has to change. Similarly, the focus of the wool industry is moving away from production research toward research into adding value to our wool clip&mdash;a change in direction which I would have thought all honourable senators would agree is desirable. While research in some areas will, without question, diminish, as it will in the Chicken Meat Research and Development Council, emerging priorities in other agricultural research will consequently receive greater attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes being proposed by the CSIRO are aimed at maintaining the aggregate level of research while extracting greater efficiency from existing assets&mdash;exactly what Senator Abetz said it should be doing; that is what it is doing and what it is now being criticised for&mdash;thereby reducing the cost of conducting the research. Again, these are all laudable and supportable goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a decline in wool industry levy collections as a result of reduced industry revenue over recent years, stemming from, as we all know, the catastrophically low prices on the international wool market. That is what has caused this dramatic reduction in the levy flow. On top of that, of course, there was an unsustainable boom in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government matching grants have correspondingly declined, but the effect of this drop in revenue has to date been softened by substantial investment of reserves by AWRC totalling some $10 million last year. The problem has been that the research effort by the CSIRO and other institutions is geared to funding levels linked to the boom in revenues in the late 1980s. Maintaining research activity at around that level has quickly depleted the available reserves to the point where, this year, very little is available. I make that point for Senator Coulter's benefit, to indicate to him that a countercyclical mechanism already exists. The problem is that expectations of research effort have been defined by the peak level of funding rather than the historical average. Of course, that is what always happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out that in 1989 we brought down a science statement. That science statement gave a commitment to, I think, $150 million of additional funding for infrastructure improvement and a number of defined projects. Indeed, our former minister for science pointed that out in the caucus this morning, and it has been pointed out in here. Of course, what always happens&mdash;it does not matter whether one is talking about rural research, RAS or whatever&mdash;is that if one puts in additional effort and announces three years in advance that there is going to be a cut-off date for a project such as black spots road funding, one always runs the risk when that cut-off time comes of people saying, `You have cut funding.' It is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The base funding&mdash;and it is important in terms of the budget processes of a government that this is emphasised, despite Senator Coulter's objections&mdash;will be given an important boost. The $30 million a year into the base funding of course goes onto that base when the next triennial funding for CSIRO is discussed in three years time. It is exactly the same arrangement with the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important concerns have been raised that assets said to be funded by wool growers are being sold off without consultation, with the proceeds being taken away from wool research. Some of these assets were developed with the help of contributions from the old Australian Wool Corporation. Wool growers funded about 25 per cent of the resources of that institution, the rest of the funding coming from the Commonwealth. We have spoken to CSIRO about this. I want to give an assurance to honourable senators that I will ensure that proper and full consultation between CSIRO and industry occurs&mdash;and it will occur&mdash;in terms of any equity that industry has in those investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of my own staff have already met with the CSIRO and we have already received assurances that the proceeds from the sale of those jointly funded assets will be preserved for wool research purposes. Consultation with industry was always planned, with the CSIRO due to meet both the Wool Council and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation this week. Indeed, I left a meeting with that organisation in my office to come in here for this debate, and I will be going back to it. As I left, the subject we were discussing was the consultations that will occur between those industry organisations and CSIRO next week as to the proper handling of any equity that industry has. So I can assure honourable senators who have raised this matter&mdash;I think Senator Crane and Senator Panizza both raised it&mdash;that it will be taken full account of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed with interest the comments of Senator O'Chee on this matter last week. His views were delivered with his usual professional toastmasters' style, but with absolutely no regard for substance or fact, which is his normal delivery. Firstly, he suggested that the Commonwealth was looking to sell off the Queensland sugar experiment stations. I am sure that this will come as great news to the state government of Queensland which actually owns the research stations in question, not the Commonwealth. So I am sure that the news that those Queensland government-owned assets will be sold off by us will come as a great shock to the Queensland government. Perhaps it will not come as a great shock because I guess it will dismiss what Senator O'Chee says, as all sensible people always do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I have to make the point that I was a little surprised that a Queensland senator, who constantly tells us that he represents rural Queensland, would not know that the research stations he was trying to run a scaremongering campaign about&mdash;that we were supposed to be selling&mdash;are not in fact even owned by us. Senator O'Chee went on to say that the sale would be another way&mdash;this is again the sale where we are going to sell something we do not own&mdash;to cut back funding for sugar research and development. It is another gross error of fact by Senator O'Chee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth matching funding, of course, is against the industry funding of 0.5 per cent of GDP. I might add that that is a fairly kindergarten piece of information which anyone who has even the slightest knowledge of dollar-for-dollar matching funding knows. It has absolutely nothing whatever to do with whether Queensland government state-owned research stations are sold or not. All that this garbage of Senator O'Chee did was highlight the fact that the opposition, as I started this debate by saying, is simply playing a little political game on this issue. </PARA>

It is playing this little game of outrageous and unsupportable scare campaigns in states and in industries that it purports to represent in this chamber&mdash;which it represents very badly, I might add.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have demonstrated very clearly that a great deal of the opposition's case on this matter is built on sand. In fact, a lot of it is just outright nonsense, as I have just demonstrated in regard to Senator O'Chee. The very aims that Senator Abetz, in his contribution to this debate yesterday, said the CSIRO should be pursuing&mdash;that is, getting away from a concentration on structures and getting more money back into research&mdash;is precisely what these changes are designed to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the one inescapable fact in this debate which has not been acknowledged by a single opposition senator&mdash;because it is an undeniable fact&mdash;is that currently the Commonwealth government is putting in a level of support for rural research in Australia which has never been exceeded in the history of this country. It is a record commitment of which this government is justifiably proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator Coulter then moved an amendment to expand those ideas. I would like to ask Senator Collins, through the chair, where anywhere in this inquiry I can be said to be demanding extra funding. That is not the case. One cannot read anything of the kind into the terms of reference. It is possible that it could be recommended that funding be increased or indeed that funding should be cut. One of my colleagues brought up that fear and asked what my attitude would be if it were recommended that agricultural research in CSIRO should be reduced. My reply was that I will take the chance. One never knows what will come out of an inquiry. I am prepared to take the chance that there could be a recommendation to reduce funding, but I very much doubt it. We shall await the recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Collins has to go to a meeting and is about to leave the chamber, but I would remind the Senate that he made the point that in 1983, when we left government, only $30 million of federal money went into CSIRO agriculture research. What Senator Collins failed to add to that figure was state research funding and grower levies. In making up the funding record in terms of agricultural research amounting to $700 million, he included what the federal government put in, as well as what the state government put in and also grower levies. All of that went to make up the figure of $700 million. But when he referred to the coalition government in 1983, very conveniently he left that out. So much for Senator Collins's argument. Perhaps I can be told where in the inquiry's terms of reference there is any demand for extra funding. I emphasise the fact that an inquiry may recommend extra funding or may recommend cuts, or indeed leave the situation as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins also said that the CSIRO was doing a good job. I agree and nowhere have I said in my deliveries in the past couple of days that that organisation is not doing a good job. It is doing an excellent job, but I want to keep it that way. This inquiry has been brought about by the proposed changes. Indeed, the inquiry came from the scientists themselves. Most of the scientists working for CSIRO do not have degrees in business administration. Therefore, in order to get their message across and to give time to get on with their own research, they approached politicians such as those of us on this side of the chamber, and no doubt senators opposite too, to express those fears in this place. It certainly cannot be said that we are suggesting the CSIRO is not doing a good job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to Senator Collins in silence. I hope that the minister at the table or would-be minister at the table, Senator Sherry, will accord me the same courtesy. At any rate, I congratulate Donald McGauchie on his election as president of the NFF and I know that he will do a good job. There are two paragraphs in the press release that I would like to refer to. Certainly the rest are very innocuous and indeed are motherhood statements. The press release says that in any proposed inquiry:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute's increasing deficit should be taken into account by the Federal Opposition as it considers an inquiry into CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course we want the matter to be taken into consideration by the inquiry. The next paragraphs reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any such inquiry should be completed very quickly as CSIRO believes it could not proceed with necessary expenditure reforms until the inquiry process is complete.</PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has already discussed this and made plans. The committee's reporting date is the end of the sitting year but that does not mean that the committee cannot report before then&mdash;there would be nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would not worry about holding up CSIRO from doing some things. I would certainly want to hold up the CSIRO from selling off its research station at Yallanbee in Western Australia. As I explained yesterday, that is a very important research station&mdash;the only one located in a Mediterranean-type climate. And that is the description from one of the top scientists in the CSIRO; it is not my description. The last paragraph of the press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The government must urgently consider a mechanism for topping up research resources in the event of major industry downturn," Mr McGauchie said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the only demand I have seen for extra funding in all this debate. So what is Senator Collins on about when he claims that the debate is about extra funding? That finishes my comments on what Senator Collins said. I now turn to what Senator Cook said yesterday when he claimed that no speaker in the debate had attended the estimates committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is wrong because one speaker in the debate is on the estimates committee. I have been on plenty of estimates committees where Senator Cook was the minister at the table, especially on ATSIC. Generally, he would prevent any sort of real questioning of officers at the table by taking over an answer. I would ask a question of the officer but, time and time again, Senator Cook would answer. He was only there to protect his department and not let questioning flow. That does not apply to other ministers who attend the table at Senate estimates hearings but Senator Cook is very good at it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So much for that point of order! Yesterday, Senator Cook made a big play about access to CSIRO&mdash;that members of the opposition barged into the CSIRO and demanded attention. However, that has been slightly changed. This morning, when I read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, it did not seem to come over quite the same, so I intend to get a tape of that later on. However, the call by me and Senator Abetz for an inquiry was a result of a call by the scientists who work for the CSIRO who urged us to get an inquiry up. There was no other reason at all. If anyone from the CSIRO or either the federal government or a statutory body walks into my office and asks to be heard, I do not accept that I must have someone from the minister's office sit in as an independent notetaker. Anyhow, that matter has been covered by my colleagues; but it should be emphasised, otherwise we would return to the jackboot brigade of over 50 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in his speech, Senator Cook attacked me for self-interest. I thank Senator Ferguson and Senator Crane for replying on my behalf, so I do not have to really address that matter myself. This matter of the CSIRO is not the only concern about which people have come to me. I have certainly taken up other concerns of other people. I could rattle off half a dozen such examples but I do not want to bore honourable senators and keep the Senate from voting fairly soon on this motion. So that matter has been well answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty per cent of the research funding goes to agricultural research&mdash;no-one is denying that and nothing in the motion says that that funding should be either increased or decreased; I have gone through all of that. However, when Senator Cook referred to that funding, to suit his argument he left out grower levies, so I am afraid that Senator Cook's contribution was not very conducive to good debate in this place. Senator Crane aptly summed up the contribution by Senator Cook by describing him as having lost the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, Senator Cook also said that the chamber had not heard any supporting evidence for an inquiry. I point him to the very simple fact that the CSIRO's agricultural research has been directed to concentrate on research which benefits small business. As I said yesterday, there is nothing wrong with that. Such small business is defined as a business employing 20 persons or more and with a turnover of more than $2 million a year. Rural research will suffer as a result of that focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could mention many other things about Senator Cook's intemperate speech but it would be hardly worth while going over it again. However, I remind Senator Cook of one thing: he broke away from addressing the real point in the debate yesterday by referring to research into value adding and all of that. In doing so, he missed the point that we can value add as much as we like but we first must have the primary production to value add. If we let that run down, there will be nothing to value add, which would be a great loss to the Australian economy. Yesterday, Minister Cook admitted that the primary industries and energy output amounts to 23 per cent of our exports. If we are to maintain that output the focus of funding research must remain in the CSIRO for it to move forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, there is another point that I have to address on what Senator Cook said yesterday. He stood up in this chamber and said that under restructuring, at most three people could lose their jobs. So I will read from the document I have here, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The brief given to Senator Cook by the CSIRO board suggests that the net decrease in research staff would only be three. From the figures in the attached sheet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with which I will not bore the chamber&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which have been confirmed, it is clear that a total of 331 staff are expected to leave CSIRO as a result of this exercise. The figures include 148 staff who are expected to accept redundancy rather than relocate to other sites&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not comment on that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">plus 183 forced redundancies. The net loss, taking into account the anticipated re-hiring of some 187 new staff, is 144 positions. Of these three are claimed to be research scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in real terms a significant proportion of those positions would be considered research staff. As an example, over 50 per cent of the staff of this laboratory are directly involved in research.</PARA>
<PARA>I am talking there about wool technology. That puts paid to Senator Cook who misled the Senate yesterday when he said that only three would be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I touch again on that other fiasco where CSIRO staff are allowed to talk only when somebody accompanies them. Let me quote again from a statement that came to me&mdash;it is from the Institute of Animal Production and Processing and it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Stoker indicated in a letter dated 22 April 1994, sent to all institutes, and via them to all divisions, that in the interests of fostering a constructive relationship with a new Minister for Science, he, and he alone, would be responsible for public comment regarding CSIRO's budget outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know at whose direction that was. My guess is that it was Senator Cook. I thank all senators who have supported me in this motion. I thank Senator Coulter&mdash;who I do not agree with very often&mdash;for his promised support for this motion. I believe it is going to be a very important inquiry which will keep a very good organisation focused on rural research. I look forward to seeing the results of the division, if there is to be one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill 1994 provides for the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline. This matter has a long and chequered history. The sale was first flagged five years ago at the 1989 budget and expressions of interest for the sale were sought as long ago as December 1989. The Senate will recall that the Hawke Labor government decided to adopt a crash approach to the sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the budget sittings in 1990 the government introduced the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill which sought to increase haulage charges by no less than 56 per cent in an attempt to increase the value of the pipeline. That bill also attempted to break two legally enforceable contracts into which this government had entered many years earlier. The first was a contract between the Pipeline Authority and its users on charges. The second was a first right of refusal agreement between the Pipeline Authority and the AGL company, from which the pipeline had first been commandeered and nationalised back in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was during the time of the Whitlam government, when the then minister for resources and national development, Mr Rex Connor, lead the push for the government nationalising many of Australia's resources. Indeed, it was a government that did enormous harm to resource development in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course of action that was proposed by the Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill in 1990 was nothing short of a disgrace because the bill attempted to get the government to break legal contractual arrangements. For that reason, the coalition opposed the bill very strenuously and, I am pleased to record, was so successful that the Senate accordingly rejected that bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of accepting the commonsense proposals of the coalition, industry and commentators&mdash;there was a way through had it been handled sensibly&mdash;the government withdrew the sale. It took its bat and ball and went home sulking. But the government had the audacity to accuse the coalition of thwarting and aborting its asset sales program. Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. That was never the intention of the coalition because for many years the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline had been part of our privatisation program. However, unlike the government, we were not prepared to adopt a process of negotiation for sale which would involve the breaking of legal contractual arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992 budget the pipeline sale was resurrected, albeit after the government had copped an absolute caning by the courts for previously attempting to breach its contractual arrangements. At that time those court decisions fully supported, substantiated and vindicated the approach that the coalition had taken. Fortunately, this time around the government decided to adopt the more sensible approach of consulting AGL&mdash;which held special rights of first refusal&mdash;as the coalition had advocated from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sale, like most of the other asset sales upon which the government has embarked, has had a very chequered, tawdry history. It has been a very prolonged and messy affair and one from which the government can draw no credit at all because of the way it has been handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1993 the government announced the establishment of a regulatory regime for national gas markets under which the sale could proceed and introduced the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill. That bill was eventually deferred in the latter part of 1993 after much concern was expressed about it, firstly, because of lack of consultation with the states, which were concerned about the impact of the bill on competition, and secondly, because it seemed to be hastily and sloppily drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1993 a conditional sale was negotiated with AGL, with AGL to purchase 51 per cent of the pipeline. In December 1993 a tender process was commenced for the sale of the remaining 49 per cent. That tender process was completed just last week with Novacorp International of Canada obtaining 25 per cent and Petronas of Malaysia obtaining the balance of 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has said that the gross proceeds will be between $520 million and $540 million, leaving net sale proceeds of around $470 million after various compensation payments are made. However, it is worth noting that, as part of the negotiations, the Commonwealth will have to assume some $190 million worth of debt. That means that the net return to the Commonwealth will be of the order of $280 million to $300 million if calculated on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even if we were looking at the $470 million for the net sale program&mdash;forgetting all about the debt that is being assumed&mdash;it is still a very distant cry from the $750 million or thereabouts that the then finance minister, Mr Willis, claimed in 1991 would be the proceeds of the sale, and for the loss of which he quite wrongly berated the coalition for not allowing the sale to proceed. The competitive national regulatory regime for the gas industry is still to be finalised by the Commonwealth and the state governments through COAG. However, this is an issue separate from the sale and we will be scrutinising that at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regime arising from the COAG process will implement what was intended to be covered by the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill and more. I assume that complementary state legislation will be required to complete the necessary arrangements in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill before the Senate only concludes a limited regulatory regime to deal with the privately owned and operated pipeline. It is designed to ensure fair access, and it is judged by all parties as likely to do that. The Trade Practices Commission is still required to grant approval for the corporate structure of the purchasing vehicle before final approval is given; but that again appears to be more of a technicality and does not go to the heart of this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the sale of the pipeline. As I said earlier, we have long advocated this course of action. The pity is that this Labor government's sheer pig-headedness a few years ago resulted in the sale being surrounded with controversy and concern as it was delayed, deferred and finally revised only after the government's spending splurge needed some non-debt funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be proposing specific amendments to the bill. The government has some technical amendments, and the coalition will not be opposing those either. If we take the whole history of this matter over the past five years, the sale process and the surrounding issues of competition should be remembered as a good example of how not to go about things in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which this matter progressed early on was unfortunate. It did great damage to the government's credibility in the world of business and commerce because what the government proposed back in 1990-91 was a procedure which showed that the government was not prepared to keep its word on legally enforceable contracts and it tried to break them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that that situation has now changed and that the sale has been negotiated to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. The sale will pave the way for a very worthwhile and beneficial development in this area. There are some points that I will take up in the committee stage and I will seek some undertakings of what I understand to be the government's intent in respect of some of the clauses of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill 1994. There are two points that need to be made right up front in relation to the sale of this asset. This is just another of the moves by the government to sell anything at all to improve the current account situation. In this case the government is selling what is essentially an asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two points are as follows: firstly, the government is selling this asset well below its real price, and I will produce evidence to that effect; secondly, the government is selling an asset which is extremely profitable and therefore should be kept in the public domain. Since 1988 the ratio of net earning before tax compared with assets has risen from 14 per cent to 24 per cent, which is out-performing the majority of the 500 top companies in Australia. That is the essence of what I want to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be selling assets that are owned by all the people of Australia at below their proper price&mdash;particularly assets which are so profitable and are therefore helping the government in the longer term with its financing of other programs. We have just completed a debate in relation to CSIRO funding. Here we have the sale of an asset which is highly profitable, and which is generating income for government. This asset is being sold off at less than its real value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been rushed through parliament in an attempt to have the sale completed by 30 June to make the budget deficit for 1993-94 look better. It is one of these hand-to-mouth activities where the government says, `Simply scrape through this year, make the accounts look as good as you can, and to hell with what happens afterwards; leave the problems behind for other governments or later generations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling that asset sales are included in the budget deficit figures which mix up both current and capital expenditure. That has been done deliberately by this government to obfuscate the situation before the Australian public. In 1993-94 the government will fund $2 billion worth of recurrent expenditure from asset sales; in 1994-95 the government hopes to fund $2.4 billion from asset sales. It is capital being used to prop up expenditure. It simply would not be accepted in any ordinary business, and it should not be tolerated in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When everything that the people of Australia own has been sold, how will the federal government fund its recurrent expenditure? It is difficult to identify why the Moomba system has been chosen for privatisation, other than simply because it can be sold now and it happens to be profitable. Firstly, it is a natural monopoly. Secondly, under the contractual arrangements agreed to by Rex Connor in 1974 AGL had a right to first bid. AGL is the monopoly distributor of gas in Sydney. As the Industry Commission pointed out in its report on gas, AGL's purchase of the system raises serious concerns about vertical integration in the gas industry. Thirdly, because of the favourable borrowing arrangements in the Commonwealth, no private sector bidder would be likely to be prepared to pay a price which represented the real value to the Commonwealth of retaining this asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Bob Walker from the University of New South Wales estimated in 1992 that the then value of the pipeline to the Commonwealth was between $649 million and $981, depending on the estimated sales revenue growth. By contrast, the government expects to receive just $510 million to $550 million gross and about $300 million net from the sale. That is grossly below the real value of this asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, as the debts of the Pipeline Authority have fallen, the profitability of the pipeline has increased markedly, rising from $19 million in 1992-93 to $25.3 million in 1993-94. Of course, the all important net earning before tax profitability of the pipeline compared with assets has improved from 14 per cent in 1988 to 24 per cent last year and, as I said earlier, is outperforming the majority of the top 500 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The question must be asked: why sell it? The answer must be because the government wants money and is too scared to cut expenditure or to raise taxes. That bears fairly and squarely on the inadequacies of this government's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation has been extremely complex. The web of legal contracts left over from Rex Connor's time in setting up the Pipeline Authority in 1974 has created a wide range of legal rights. In its desperation to have the sale finished this year, the government has paid big money to buy out these rights, paying $30 million to AGL and $20 million to the Cooper Basin gas producers. We have seen no public evidence whatsoever as to whether these payments are reasonable or were based on independent and sound legal and financial advice. Publicly, the only defence we have seen of the $20 million agreed to be paid to the producers last month was eight lines in a ministerial press release. We will not even know until the end of next week whether the boards of directors of the affected companies will accept the settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same press release also contained the only justification for the government deciding to sell 49 per cent of this important strategic pipeline to foreign interests. This time we have four lines informing us that the toothless Foreign Investment Review Board had approved the sale. As the Senate now knows, the Foreign Investment Review Board has only an advisory capacity and is without any real power whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, there is no public evidence as to why the approval was granted, why this foreign consortium was chosen, whether Australian bidders were considered and why the company was not floated. None of that evidence has been provided. Instead, we will add to our net foreign equity liabilities, which have grown from nine per cent to 16 per cent of GDP in just four years, and add to the current account headache our children will inherit when the dividends start flowing out of the country to the growing number of foreign owners of this country&mdash;foreign owners of our land and our assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does a number of things. It allows the establishment of a company called Newco, which will take over the assets of the Pipeline Authority. It then allows the government to sell Newco&mdash;51 per cent to AGL and 49 per cent to a minority shareholder, the foreign owned syndicate. The bill also establishes an elaborate post-sale regulation system. These provisions were hastily added to the bill at the second reading stage in the House of Representatives, with more amendments moved here today. It is clearly a very scrappily put together piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, this regulatory system has been developed with the assistance of the Trade Practices Commission and seeks to ensure that third parties have access to the pipeline. The late amendments act to improve these access provisions. Access disputes will be arbitrated by the Trade Practices Tribunal under clause 80 of the bill. I will be moving an amendment to clause 80 to widen the arbitral powers of the Trade Practices Commission and I understand that the government will accept this first amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under its basic legislation, the Trade Practices Commission and the tribunal have the power to take into account the public benefit. This is a wide test which includes the benefit of competition and consumer and environment interests. But the bill before us, under the influence of the ideologically driven Hilmer competition policy report, I suspect, sees a narrow public benefit only&mdash;the benefit of competitive markets. This is unacceptable and will restrict the tribunal in its decision making as well as ignoring two decades of the development of trade practices law. For that reason, I will be seeking to amend this clause. I will also seek to insert a new clause after clause 137. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical of this Labor government that it is prepared to pay out $50 million of taxpayers' money to settle out of the public eye&mdash;I have drawn attention to the lack of information we have on these settlements&mdash;the contractual obligations of big companies, but it has not agreed to a settlement with the employees of the authority, the little people, the little workers. I notice the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, is in the chamber. Senator Cook is formerly of the ACTU, and he should be absolutely ashamed of the deal that the current workers in the Pipeline Authority are being given by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These employees deserve to be commended. The authority has dramatically increased its profits and is outperforming the majority of the large public companies&mdash;the Labor mates in the big end of town. The employees can take credit for much of this, but Labor proposes more than just privatising this company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new owner has said that as many as one-third of the existing employees will not be needed. If people are not prepared to move from the Canberra headquarters to the AGL Sydney office, this number could rise. Also, the government will allow AGL to make employment offers to the employees, which will include AGL's considerably less generous superannuation and redundancy schemes. Those who refuse AGL offers will be redundant and, if not deployed, retrenched. Shame, shame, shame on a Labor government that says that it looks after the interests of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employees will not receive just compensation for the quashing of their contractual obligations. The government has not said it will pay them the emerging community standard for compensation&mdash;the sort of compensation that it paid to the workers of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and Commonwealth management funds when those operations were partially privatised. No, they will get only the inadequate public service standard. The government can find $50 million to compensate the big companies for loss of their contractual rights, but it cannot find $2 million to compensate these hardworking and highly productive employees for the loss of their contractual rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government says it wants people to work harder and to be more productive. When they do work harder and are more productive, it simply hits them in the face, makes them redundant and fails to adequately compensate them for their loss of jobs. These employees have been forced to consider taking industrial action for the first time in the authority's 20-year history to defend their rights. Again, it is a sad reflection on this government that it is introducing legislation and a process which forces workers, who for 20 years have been without industrial action, to take such desperate action to defend their rights. I will be seeking to move an amendment to clause 137 to require the government or AGL to reach a just agreement on superannuation entitlements and redundancy payments after the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked to see this bill go to the Senate industry committee. There is still so much in this bill which is unclear. I would like to see the government defend its regulatory regime, its $50 million payments and its decision to sell 49 per cent to Novacorp of Canada and Petronas of Malaysia. I would like to see the arrangements on compensation to staff finalised and reported to the Senate before this bill is passed. In particular, I would like to see the government defend its decision to sell the pipeline and see what defence it has to Professor Walker's assertion that the government is selling this asset for well below its present value. But the new-look, moderate coalition has a new privatisation spokesperson&mdash;the in-again, out-again, sell-it-all Mr Moore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the big end of town has been placated with its compensation payouts, the interest of the coalition in making sure this sale was accountable to the public and a fair deal disappeared, and disappeared completely. We have heard from the opposition that it is quite prepared to acquiesce in the passage of this legislation. I find this curious because if Labor sells this asset for below its market value it will be one less asset which the coalition can sell to fund its promises if it wins an election. If it wins an election, it will be left with the massive debts that this government will inevitably leave behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill should be closely scrutinised. It disappoints me that, because of the coalition's change of heart and the government's desperate need to cook the books in 1993-94, it will not be scrutinised. It disappoints me greatly that the opposition and government will combine to pass this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be voting against this legislation. We believe it is wrong. We believe the government is selling an asset at well below its true value. It is selling an asset which is highly profitable and, therefore, of long-term benefit to all the people of Australia, not just to AGL, a private company, and the 49 per cent foreign ownership company into whose hands it will pass. We will be seeking to divide on this matter because we believe it is very important. These very important assets are owned by all the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill 1994. We have just resumed the second reading debate, the second reading speech having been given in the Senate a while back. I acknowledge that in this debate both Senator Short, representing the coalition, and Senator Coulter have participated. While, of course, not necessarily agreeing with anything they have put, I do not remember any particular point that stands out from which the government should dissociate itself. I nonetheless acknowledge their contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of this asset, as has been referred to by both speakers, is a complex and time-consuming process. However, this bill does represent the last lap of the course and we can look forward, hopefully, to the completion of at least the principal part of that process by the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition in the House of Representatives did not oppose the bill when it appeared in that chamber. They did say that they had a series of points on which they had reservations, but acknowledged that the sale process was dynamic and continuing as they spoke and that, therefore, they would wait until the bill arrived in the Senate to see whether the points of reservation they had raised in the House had been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the points of reservation have been resolved. I note that Senator Short, on behalf of the coalition, has indicated that the coalition will not oppose the legislation&mdash;I am not sure whether that is the right phrase, or whether the coalition will support it. Whichever it is, the bill will pass here in this chamber, subject to some issues that he wants recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as being confirmed in the committee stage of this bill. I look forward to his issues being raised, as I expect they will be, so they can be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, as has been indicated by the two previous speakers, some government amendments. These government amendments which will be put at the committee stage are amendments to add to the bill and to meet the sorts of reservations raised in the House and referred to by Senator Short here. They will take the process that stage further. I will be moving those amendments at the appropriate time but I propose, before I resume my seat, to indicate the considered reasons in my concluding remarks as to why the government will be putting those amendments forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other amendments to this bill have been foreshadowed. They have been circulated in the chamber, both under the pen of Senator Coulter. One of them, dealing with clause 80, page 38, line 37, is an amendment which I now foreshadow the government will accept. The other, dealing with an insert after clause 137 on page 56, I indicate now is an amendment the government will not accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that we do not canvass these things at undue length, I will give Senator Coulter some reasons why we will not accept his amendment. The principal reason is that there is no real precedent for the parliament to intervene in a process of industrial negotiation. The government recognises and values the service and work of employees of the Pipeline Authority. I, for a short time, had ministerial responsibility for the authority. I can attest to the competence and expertise of those workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the decision to sell the authority, it does raise questions of what the rights of employees who transmit their employment from the authority to the new private sector owners will be. As a consequence of an interest by those workers and by the managers of the new authority, and the Pipeline Authority itself, in ensuring that good management should prevail and rights should be properly recognised, negotiations are currently afoot between the union and those two authorities. Action by us would be tantamount to intervening in an industrial process and interfering in those negotiations. For that reason, the precedential reason&mdash;the inappropriateness of it&mdash;we would not do so. That is a substantial reason why the government will not support that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is far and away more preferable that the rights and obligations of employers and employees be settled between them. We recognise that if that is not possible, the proper avenue of appeal is the Industrial Relations Commission which is constituted to resolve these things, not the parliament. That right of appeal, if it is taken, should be pursued in the proper and normal way. For those particular reasons we will not be supporting the second amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of remarks I would like to make before I turn to my reasons for the new amendments. Some of these will be picked up in my remarks, but one concerns producers' rights. The other concerns the regulatory apparatus that the states have raised concerns about. I think these are the two areas in which the opposition has been interested in having the government more clearly state its position. With respect to producers' rights, the government has reached in principle agreement on the resolution of producers' rights in the context of the sale, subject of course to board approvals being obtained from each of the producers&mdash;and there are six of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this agreement, clause 83 of the sale bill is being amended&mdash;and I foreshadow that&mdash;to protect the various gas haulage rights of producers under existing contracts. In consideration of the removal of the government guarantee, extinguishment of the veto and some other rights, the producers will receive a compensation payment from the government of $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of some of the concerns raised by the states about the regulatory arrangements&mdash;this has been referred to by Senator Short&mdash;I can advise the chamber that the COAG working group on gas reform has been consulted on the regulatory provisions. All the states, including Victoria, are now content on the basis that, in the first instance, the bill provides that the principles implemented in any future access regime for essential facilities be taken into account by the Trade Practices Commission in making an access determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make in respect to this is that Mr Beazley gave an undertaking in the House on 12 May that the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) would review the sale legislation to ensure that it conforms with any COAG initiatives on national pipeline regulation. That would be the normal point at which I would commend this bill to the chamber and resume my seat while waiting for the committee stage, but I might take a moment longer to indicate the reasons why the government will be moving the amendments in the first stage of the committee debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system on the basis of a sale of 51 per cent to the Australian Gaslight Company and a competitive tender conducted for the remaining 49 per cent. This tender has resulted in preferred bidder status for a consortium headed by a Canadian company, Novacorp International, with Petroliam Nasional Berhard (Petronas) of Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's agreement to the proposed sale of AGL was subject to a range of conditions which included a successful outcome to the 49 per cent tender process and the approval of sale structure by the Trade Practices Commission. Part 6 of the Moomba-Sydney system sale bill provides for a regulatory regime developed due to the deferral of the Interstate Gas Pipeline Bill and to apply specifically to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system post sale. This regime was developed with the assistance of the Trade Practices Commission and key parties with an interest in the sale were consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular condition on the sale was the resolution of various contractual rights held by the Cooper Basin gas producers. The government has reached a negotiated settlement with the producers which is presently being documented. The amendments to be introduced today primarily reflect the outcome of the negotiations with the Cooper Basin gas producers on their existing contractual rights and the resolution of residual concerns of the Trade Practices Commission. The remainder of the amendments are technical only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 1 to 3 are of a technical nature to ensure that the provisions operate as intended. Some words are omitted from clause 32 and a provision is re-positioned from clause 73 to clause 66. Proposed amendments 4 to 7 to clause 80 will provide the Cooper Basin gas producers, their successors and assigns with legislative protection of schedule A volumes of gas as calculated in accordance with schedule C which the Australian Gas Light Company, AGL, has contracted to purchase for the producers pursuant to the 1971 letter of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislative protection does not operate to prohibit a re-examination by the Trade Practices Commission of its prior authorisation of the letter of agreement under the Trade Practices Act. The amendments will also provide legislative protection for gas supply contracts between AGL and its downstream customers through priority protection to contractual rights and obligations already entered into and the contractual rights and obligations which will be entered into after sale and in force before an access dispute is notified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the intent of clause 80(3)(ba) is to ensure that the actual gas requirement under gas supply contracts entered into before a dispute is notified to the TPC have priority over access granted to a third party under any determination the TPC may make. Nothing in the definitions inserted in subclause 80(8) of the amendments operates to remove the protection accorded to the producers' rights under the letter of agreement by section 80(3) should the producers assign those rights in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 8 and 9 resolve residual Trade Practice Commission concerns with the legislation as introduced on 12 May and provide for the Trade Practices Commission and the relevant party to be informed should the haulage services provided under a TPC determination be diminished through those services being required to fulfil an existing contract. The notice must be given within seven days of the time when the decrease happens and the provision can be enforced through a federal court action in the event of an infringement. Amendment 10 is a technical amendment made for clarification. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the reasons advanced by the government in support of the amendments that I foreshadow we will move in the committee stage. I have not canvassed the arguments that several of the speakers have made about how we came to the point of this legislation. They have made their observations in the political way in which they choose. They are not the government's views, but nonetheless I acknowledge the views that they have put, and I commend this legislation to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the public benefit including the benefit in having competitive markets;".</PARA>
<PARA>This first amendment amends clause 80, which begins on page 37. It comes under division 4 of the bill, which deals with arbitration of access disputes. Clause 80 talks about the TPC arbitrating an access dispute, saying that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it must make a written determination about the matters to which the arbitration relates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is subsection (1), and various other subsections set out the various conditions. We come to subsection (6), which says:</PARA>

<PARA>Paragraph (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the benefit to the public in having competitive markets; </PARA>
<PARA>The objection we have to that wording is that it is simply constraining the benefit to the public within the ideological notion of a competitive market. The implicit assumption lying behind that is that there is no benefit to the public whatsoever other than a benefit which would come through having competitive markets. We are reminded of that absolutely atrocious Hilmer report, which again prejudges in ideological terms what sort of society we should live in&mdash;one in which we are cutting each other's throats in a competitive way&mdash;and says that that should be the end goal of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that a much wider definition of public benefit is required. I am pleased that, in moving this amendment to change the words `the benefit to the public in having competitive markets', the government has accepted the amendment `the public benefit including the benefit in having competitive markets'. Clearly, that will allow the Trade Practices Commission to take in a wider range of considerations, as it should.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) say earlier that the government will accept this amendment to change subclause 80(6)(b) from `the benefit to the public in having competitive markets' to `the public benefit including the benefit in having competitive markets'. I believe that that is a significant amendment. The way the bill is drafted places a very important role on having competitive markets. But I think to change the wording to the wording now proposed by Senator Coulter could well be interpreted as having a judgment in relation to the public benefit, despite having a perhaps less than adequately competitive situation. So I must say that I think Senator Coulter's wording is a very significant watering down of subclause 80(6)(b). Therefore, I will be calling against it. I would oppose it, although I will not divide on it, but I must say that I am very surprised that the government is accepting that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the implication of what he is saying; that there is no need to give a major priority to competition in these markets. I would have to say that that is typical of the whole approach of the Australian Democrats, so I was not surprised to hear what Senator Coulter said. It is precisely that mentality which has led to Australia being uncompetitive internationally. It has caused many of the problems&mdash;a million unemployed and the like&mdash;that this country has been facing for years. In this country we are desperately trying to get an attitudinal change whereby we place emphasis on becoming internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The second amendment is to clause 137 which deals with the Commonwealth's payment of compensation for the ending of certain contractual rights. Clearly, that heading indicates that there are contractual rights which the Commonwealth has in relation to the workers who work for the present authority. In my speech in the second reading debate I outlined how the government seemed to be quite prepared to countenance the enormous payout to AGL and private interests to buy off their contractual&mdash;and I come back to Senator Short's point&mdash;economic factors, but to totally ignore the welfare of the workers who, as I pointed out, have worked for 20 years without any industrial action. Moreover, their output has been very profitable and competitive. In the last year a profit of 24 per cent on capital was returned. That is in excess of the majority of the 500 leading companies in Australia. Evidently, the government cannot find only $2 million to compensate these hardworking and profitable employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to do a number of things. The workers have been in a situation of a contractual nature carrying with it certain entitlements which will be downgraded when they come under the control of the new owners. The amendment seeks to ensure that these workers, who have in every way exemplified all those qualities which the government is extolling as qualities which should be a mark of all workers in this country, and those qualities which the opposition itself regards as highly desirable and which should be rewarded, should not in any way be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than recognise that these workers have a claim and ensure that their conditions under the new owners are no less beneficial to them than the conditions under which they are now working, the government is evidently walking away from that undertaking leaving a number of these workers potentially to be dismissed, a number for various reasons to be unable to shift their employment, and a number unable to find redeployment as employees of the Commonwealth. For these reasons they are likely to be quite severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment says that there should be compensation payable to a person who becomes an employee of the new company by force of section 8 or 60 and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) whose superannuation entitlements as such an employee are less favourable than they were under the person's contract of employment with the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>Why, in the haste to sell this very profitable company to private interests to compensate those who have contractual arrangements, should the government not accept that these workers are also entitled to that sort of compensation? Subclause 137A(3) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation under subsection (2) is in recognition of that person's loss or diminution of superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment clearly spells out the justification for the entitlement. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Compensation is payable to a person who:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) does not receive, or does not consent to an offer of employment under section 7, 57 or 59; and</PARA>

<PARA>All that this amendment does is offer to these highly productive, profitable workers, who have not raised any complaint over 20 years, fair terms of compensation which any fair-minded person at all would recognise they are entitled to. I am absolutely surprised&mdash;I must say that I am quite disgusted&mdash;that a Labor government, and particularly the Labor government represented in this chamber by a former member of the ACTU, should be dealing with highly productive workers in such a shabby way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Bill 1994 and associated bills seek to amend legislation that was passed some years ago after a very important inquiry into agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Sherry was around at the time. But this major problem, which was on top of the kangaroo meat scandal, was picked up as a result of pesticide being found in beef exported to the United States. This inquiry was held because of the pesticide build-up due to the excessive use of DDT in the south of Western Australia and, to a certain extent, in the eastern states. The inquiry resulted in the introduction of agricultural and veterinary chemical bills to control the situation in Australia. Since then, additional legislation has been dealt with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of six agricultural and veterinary chemical bills introduces interim cost recovery arrangements for the operation of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I thank my colleagues Senator Brownhill, Senator Calvert and Senator Panizza for the contributions they have been able to make to this debate. The amendments are necessary because the majority of states may not have their complementary legislation through in time for the start of the national agricultural and veterinary chemicals registration scheme on 1 July this year. This has put funding of the scheme in doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original legislation set up a three-tiered method of payment: an application fee paid when applying to have a new chemical registered; a re-registration fee; and a levy on products sold. Without complementary state legislation, the re-registration fee cannot be collected by the federal government. The government therefore needs an alternative way of collecting money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, the government now intends to shift the money it would have collected in the re-registration fee on to the product levy. This will not increase the overall amount paid; it will simply transfer the amount that would have been paid for re-registration to the product levy. The amendments will sunset in 12 months and charging will then revert to the three-tiered system mentioned earlier. However, if the states pass their legislation in time, these new amendments will not be necessary and therefore will not be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the user pays concept, the government must remember that when the user pays the user also has the right to expect an efficient and cost effective service. We do not want the registration authority turning into another AQIS, where overmanning has forced the government to set aside $15.3 million in this year's budget to get rid of surplus inspectors. We need a lean organisation that will reduce the cost of registration rather than increase it. After all, the registration scheme is being established to cut the duplication of registered chemicals in each state. We need to achieve the savings that industry wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As already mentioned, the government has insisted on an 83 per cent recovery of costs next financial year, with 100 per cent the year after. I am concerned that when public servants are assured of having all their costs covered without an upper limit, they will employ more resources than necessary. The coalition will continue to keep an eye on costs charged because, ultimately, farmers will have to foot the bill. The coalition has been assured that this legislation, which will increase the levy on the product when it is sold rather than impose a re-registration fee, will end in 12 months and then revert to the original three-tiered method. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Association supports the legislation because it is only an interim measure, and the association wants the new legislation to start on 1 July. The coalition will also support these bills. </PARA>

This area is of such environmental significance that that import should have been recognised and the area should have been protected. The commission recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that no mining of mineral sands take place in any sector of the Area and, as a consequence, that further exploration for mineral sands is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that no mining for other minerals be permitted in the Area.</PARA>
<PARA>The area in question comprises approximately 1,000 square kilometres. It contains perhaps 30 per cent of all Australia's animal and plant species; it sits at the intersection of the tropics and the more temperate parts of Australia; it ranges from superb coastal areas with beaches, sand hills, perched lakes, mangrove areas, dry forests, tropical rain forests; and it contains a wide range of species, including some which are becoming rare and endangered, such as green sea turtles and dugongs. For a host of reasons, this area clearly demands protection. One of the things that the Democrats have been suggesting for a long time is World Heritage protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This commission of inquiry does not go that far, but it certainly recognises the importance of the area. We urge the government to make a very quick decision that no mining should proceed. Ultimately, it is a political decision that we are waiting for here. Whether this leads to compensation is another question. Our own view is that there should be no compensation at all, because the company concerned has already been more than adequately compensated, having paid $350,000 for leases and having already been compensated to the tune of $2.2 million for the leases which existed on Fraser Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like very briefly to reflect on other events in recent days. The opposition has raised a number of questions about the relationship between Mr Peter Laurance and former minister for the environment and senator Graham Richardson. I would just like to reflect on the peculiarity of the decision not to protect Shoalwater Bay, which was made at the time that stage 3 of Kakadu National Park was incorporated into the park. At the time, those decisions were considered, on the one hand, to be a sop by the government to the conservation movement in incorporating stage 3 of Kakadu into the Kakadu National Park, and, on the other hand, a sop to mining interests to allow the mining leases in the Shoalwater Bay area to stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look back at that decision I see, in the case of Kakadu stage 3 and Coronation Hill, a potential mine in an area which had already been mined, which was clearly of economic benefit and which, it could have been argued, may not have caused a great deal of environmental damage. Shoalwater Bay is essentially a pristine area. The report attaching to this area said that mining would be of marginal, if any, economic benefit but that the non-mining of the area would be of very considerable environmental benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I would certainly argue that both of those areas should have been protected, and neither of them should have been mined, if I were forced to make a choice I would have to say that in my view former Minister Richardson came to the wrong choice, and should have protected Shoalwater Bay.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This report outlines the South Australian government's progress regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It is a sad coincidence that while we are assessing the implementation of these recommendations by the South Australian government, that government is actually looking at closing a correctional facility that houses many Aboriginal prisoners in South Australia, and that is the Port Lincoln Prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a deliberate flouting of the recommendations of the royal commission and would adversely impact on Aboriginal people from right across Eyre Peninsula. The closure would be, indeed, in direct contravention of the aboriginal deaths in custody report and would certainly place the lives of Aboriginal people at risk. Unfortunately, Aboriginal people make up 25 to 40 per cent of the prison population at Port Lincoln. Already we have families travelling from as far away as Ceduna to visit relatives in that prison. Those families, together with people from the peninsula, would have a lot further to travel if the nearest facility were Port Augusta. It was a specific recommendation of the report that Aboriginal prisoners should not be placed in institutions that are a long way from their relatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns about the South Australian government's truth in sentencing legislation because it basically removes any remission for good behaviour. This has the effect of not just increasing the prison term but of removing the incentives for prisoners to behave themselves&mdash;for prisoners to try to make an effort so that they spend less time behind bars. We believe that this is already leading to unrest in remand centres and can see continuing unrest if this problem is not addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now we have the so-called audit report in South Australia that is recommending even further cuts to the South Australian prison system. This so-called audit report is not a true audit, and the document contains that disclaimer. The report exaggerates the state's debts and financial problems. It has used statistics very selectively and has not at any stage looked at the social impact of the recommendations for cuts in services. It has not looked at the different needs of South Australians. It has not looked at the social impact of the huge decrease in employment opportunities in the public sector. It has not considered the impact of any of the rises planned in charges or, in some cases, the move to introduce charges for basic services, particularly in the areas of health and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has not looked at the outcomes in South Australia. In the area of health it has not looked at South Australia's particular special needs. We in South Australia have one of the lowest income profiles of any state and that is obviously directly related to the very high unemployment level. There is also the age of the population. Unfortunately, the state government is going to use this report, which it commissioned, for its own ends&mdash;in other words, it was really just a razor gang&mdash;to further cut funding for prisons and the Port Lincoln facility is just going to be one of the casualties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government cannot walk away from this either. With ever declining general purpose grants to the states, if the federal government has a real commitment to Aboriginal people and to implementing the recommendations of this report, we will see additional funds specifically allocated for correctional facilities to make sure that the recommendations of the Aboriginal deaths in custody report can be fulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA>There are acknowledged ongoing problems with the Asian Development Bank but the Greens are most concerned about the fact that, despite the evidence in this report of some change in policy, part of the problem with the administration of the Asian Development Bank funds is that proposals may still be determined from within an elitist structure rather than by looking at regional viability and poverty alleviation at the local level. As a result, community projects, some of which are working quite well in many of the areas dealt with by the Asian Development Bank, are not necessarily the ones being funded by this kind of structure, and that is an ongoing problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some specific points that I would like to make. Page 15 details a number of areas where there is evidence of some policy shift, and that includes a strengthening of the bank's efforts to address poverty through greater emphasis on social sector investment&mdash;education, health and nutrition; gender issues and pursuit of an integrated approach to bringing women into the mainstream of development activities; population and family planning programs; and the integration of environmental considerations into the bank's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that a code of practice is being built into the kind of proposals that the bank is looking at, and that is very welcome. I note from page 23 that in addressing such issues the bank's management has organised training programs to familiarise the staff with new approaches to protecting the environment, promoting sustainable development and implementing Agenda 21. Bank staff were introduced to environment topics such as biodiversity, climate change, financing, environmental programs and the formulation of environmental loan covenants. Management's aim was for these efforts to result in a better integration of environmental concerns in the bank's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having recognised that such policy shifts are necessary in Australia, why do we not also make sure that the people in administration, finance and in Treasury are also trained in those areas to integrate our policies in a similar way? Here we are promoting and even cajoling the Asian Development Bank to direct funds more responsibly and yet it seems to be in advance of what we are doing in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 24 mentions a social dimensions unit to look at the social impact of new proposals. It seems extraordinary that we do not have a Commonwealth social impact unit. In Western Australia the social impact unit was dissolved by the Western Australian government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed on page 25, under the heading `Growth Triangles', that the bank has built on the opportunity created by the peace settlement in Cambodia to propose co-operation among Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the Yunnan province of PRC in developing their infrastructure. It would seem that this may be a means by which Australia's funds in the World Development Bank might be used to aid Burma. This would be of great concern to those people who are still worried about social justice in Burma. Perhaps Australia should be making some kind of input to the impacts of this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that Australian businesses are unable to get direct benefit as they do in our aid program which is heading towards being a trade program rather than an aid program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak about the annual report of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Asian Development Bank 1993</EMPHASIS>. This is not a very happy report. For example, on page 2, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian executive director was critical of the 1994 administrative budget and abstained on the vote for the budget because of our earlier opposition to increases in staff salaries and benefits which account for 70 per cent of the Bank's administrative expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, that statement is made on page 2. But on page 1 it says that Australia has supported a general capital increase in the bank and the Treasurer has cast his vote in favour of the proposed resolution for a general capital increase. That is very interesting. One really should ask why Australia has done that. It is quite clear that a greater percentage of Australia's aid budget is going to multilateral international financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank, without a good examination of its effectiveness or legitimacy, or the bank's commitment to human rights issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the effectiveness of the programs and projects. Page 2 states that the post-evaluation carried out in 1993 covered 26 projects, 38 per cent of which were found to be either partly successful or unsuccessful. Later, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a cumulative basis, of the 425 post-evaluated project programs classified at the end of 1993, 60 per cent were generally successful, 29 per cent partly successful and 11 per cent unsuccessful.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the statements that were made in the bank's report about sustainable development and population policies. Quite frankly, it appears obvious that the Asian Development Bank has simply assumed, falsely, that population growth in the South Pacific island developing member countries is the problem. Clearly, that is a defeatist and unfair assumption. It is unfair to the people of the South Pacific, including the people of Papua New Guinea. The Asian Development Bank, supported by AIDAB, is spending a considerable sum of money on population control activities in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific, designed to meet the demands of government targets or demographically designed programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say here and now that, despite what honourable senators may have read in the press, the key finding of the inquiry that was recently undertaken was not that the priority was population programs but that, if governments seek to improve the economic position of the poor, the largest and quickest impact will come from the most direct policy instruments available. Amongst such instruments are policies to increase access of the poor to land, credit, public infrastructure and services, particularly education and health.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a recent estimates committee the inadequate capacity of the Australian Securities Commission to ensure the accuracy of its records relating to proprietary companies was revealed by the admission that the ASC basically relies on the honesty of directors in completing their returns. The inadequacy of this approach is evident from the experience of the ASC with the false returns belatedly filed by the formerly half-owned piggery company group of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the almost three years of his ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in breach of the law, there were no returns filed for most of the group companies since their formation in 1988 until my protests about this failure from around about the middle of 1992. Secondly, in breach of the law, the returns were in the form of proprietary company returns revealing only key financial data instead of the public company returns which were required by law. Thirdly, in breach of the law, a series of full returns were submitted that were not audited. Finally, years late, audited accounts were filed that involved corrections of multimillions of dollars in the previously filed false returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these audited accounts required by law were eventually filed they demonstrated that the unaudited accounts were full of errors, all of which not surprisingly favoured the piggery group, making the companies appear stronger than they really were. Even the audited accounts were also subject to errors with at least one serious breach of proper accounting standards relating to the fiddled treatment of a debt to Mr John Brown which has magically transformed itself into shareholders' funds, instead of being a liability, even though Mr Brown has never been a shareholder of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd and redeemed his 100 redeemable preference shares in Euphron Pty Ltd in August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So apart from direct breaches of the corporations law by most group companies failing to report at all until I made a political issue of it in the Senate, and then providing inadequate exempt proprietary returns showing only inaccurate key financial data, and only finally filing audited accounts up to three years late, this piggery group clearly set out on a policy of deception by the overstatement of profits, understatement of losses and the conversion of deficits in shareholders' equity into false positive equity as revealed by the belated audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the errors in these false returns is the fact that Rincraft Pty Ltd, as the key borrowing company through which the group's massive debt to the Commonwealth Bank is held, is still in breach of the corporations law for having filed no annual returns for 1989 and 1990. The 1991 return it did file is clearly false in claiming a profit of $1,521,585 to offset the group's unaudited consolidated loss of $1,518,847. While the remarkable and continuing failure of the Securities Commission to ensure that this group abides by the corporations law is bad enough, the Prime Minister's failure to require his partner to meet the law on behalf of his half-owned piggery companies was a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rincraft's returns do not have to be audited because they are not part of the Brown and Hatton Group public company structure, being owned directly by Euphron Pty Ltd, but it still is required by law to submit unaudited annual returns. The Commonwealth Bank does, however, require audited accounts from Rincraft in its mortgage documents, but this requirement appears never to have been enforced by the bank, at least up to the time in August 1992 when the Commonwealth Bank had to make a provision of $4.5 million for loss against its accumulated loans at that time of almost $20 million. The credit committee of the bank attributed this loss to `failure to investigate adequately the financial position of the operation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rincraft's unaudited 1993 accounts show a $4.45 million increase in liabilities from $19.1 million to $23.7 million indicating either that the Commonwealth Bank is allowing the group to capitalise the interest owing rather than paying it or that another entity is lending it the money to do so. A note in the audited 1991 group accounts for the Brown and Hatton group shows interest capitalised of $2 million following $1.76 million capitalised in 1990 and $1.65 million capitalised in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capitalising so much interest would be a remarkable action by the bank to the benefit of the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister. Farmers being thrown off their land would have welcomed the same treatment instead of foreclosure. It is also remarkable that the bank registered its latest secured charge over Rincraft's assets the day after Mr Keating became Prime Minister, and only eight months before it had to write $4.5 million off this loan as a bad debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rincraft's 1991 unaudited return is clearly false in showing a positive shareholders' equity of $4.9 million, which is impossible as it would mean that the 1992 accounts represented an inexplicable reversal to a negative equity of $1.27 million rising to 1993's negative equity of $1.39 million. The 1990 Olympia Refrigeration (Sales) Pty Ltd accounts reveal a loan of $1,412,000 owed to Exhibit Resources Pty Ltd which remained outstanding in the accounts to 30 June 1991. This group was placed in the hands of a liquidator on 23 May 1991 but he has no knowledge of such a debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total assets of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd of $19.8 million were wrongly described as net tangible assets in 1990 in the annual return dated 30 December 1991, but that return was rejected by the ASC as inadequate. The company's 1990 profit shown in the version filed on 10 July 1992 of $842,999 was really a loss of $1 million, and the profit of $470,824 for 1989 was really a loss of $1.5 million when the audited accounts were eventually filed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No depreciation was charged in these 1990 unaudited accounts against the buildings, plant and equipment, although the annual return says assets are `depreciated over their estimated useful lives from the date of acquisition.' In accounts filed in December 1992, five months later, a consolidated depreciation charge of $103,000 was eventually shown. The company wrongly described as long-term loans owing to its associated company Rincraft Pty Ltd what, in fact, were short-term borrowings by Rincraft from the bank that had been on-lent. The audited accounts corrected this false impression that the liabilities were long term by converting them into current liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 profit and shareholders' equity of Brown and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd were overstated by the failure to deduct $45,000 in provision for annual leave. The unaudited 1990 accounts for Jensay Pty Ltd understated its loss and overstated its assets by the $730,432 that auditors later required to be written off as a bad debt from Olympia Refrigeration (Sales) Pty Ltd. Its liabilities were understated by $412,000 additional borrowing required from the parent to balance its books. These are all group companies under the same ownership and the same directors. Jensay's 1991 accounts were false for similar reasons with a further $412,000 write-off lifting the deficit on shareholders' funds from the $21,202 claimed in the unaudited annual return to the audited figure of $1.16 million&mdash;which by 1993 had reached $2.14 million with liabilities about double the company's assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olympia Refrigeration (Sales) Pty Ltd originally reported an unaudited loss of $141,143, which the audited accounts corrected to a loss of $800,258, as its assets were shown to have been overstated by $159,513, its liabilities understated by $473,460, and its shareholders' equity falsely claimed to have been in credit by $167,582 when the audited accounts reveal they were negative by $800,256. They were its 1990 accounts. The company's 1991 accounts were also wrong on all these scores with the deficit in shareholders' equity being understated by $180,863 when it should have been $1.16 million; by last June it had reached $2.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two other Olympia group companies both managed `typographical mistakes' in their 1990 accounts with negative shareholders' equity of $454,429 and $125,858 falsely shown as positives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was one of the few heads of state around the world who refused to attend the summit. Mr Keating's refusal is indicative of the Prime Minister's complete lack of regard, one could almost say contempt, for the environment. In the intervening two years Australia has gone backwards in terms of protecting our global and national environment. Far from the superlative record that the government likes to boast about, we are now facing a situation where Australia has done a complete backflip on the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even more concern is that after a closed meeting the negotiated text on the issue of trade and environment was watered down.

He must bring Australia into line with other OECD countries and recognise that the environment is a serious mainstream and long-term issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that I want to raise tonight concerns a statement which I made in the Senate on 5 May 1993 at a time when the then new Liberal government of Western Australia was attempting to undermine the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in that state, one Barry Carbon, and was taking advice from one Timothy Meagher. I described Timothy Meagher on that occasion as a known environmental destroyer. Now, 12 months later, Mr Timothy Meagher has written to me complaining&mdash;and I presume from his letter that he assumed that the reason I made that statement was that his company had been a consultant to one of the Alan Bond companies in relation to a development in Perth and that his company's environmental assessment of that proposed development had been rejected by the EPA, and that in some way I was criticising him on account of that assessment. </PARA>

And what I was actually referring to was that this particular development company had owned land on the Nullaki peninsular near Denmark in Western Australia and that that land was evidently separated from the main road by an area of crown land which did not provide road access to the land owned by the Palos Verdes Estates. The Palos Verdes Estates Development Co. evidently went in and cleared that land without any permission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that it was taken to court by the then Environment Protection Agency in Western Australia. The EPA won the case in the lower court but the matter was thrown out on a technicality in the upper court. It was that action by that company of which Mr Timothy Meagher was a director which caused me to describe him in those terms. So I just want to explain and amplify on that and get that into the record. I understand that the present Court government has now made Timothy Meagher the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter that I want to raise very briefly concerns another environmental matter; that is, the matter that I have been prosecuting for some years, the protection of the bilby, an animal which existed in Australia in many millions not so many decades ago and which is now confined to a very small area in south western Queensland&mdash;and is a seriously threatened species. One of the programs to bring the plight of the bilby to the attention of Australia, particularly Australia's children, involved encouraging the replacement of the Easter bunny with the Easter bilby. Of course, that involved also the suggestion that chocolate bilbies be made available at Easter time rather than chocolate bunnies. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;When my remarks were interrupted a short time ago, I was dealing with companies within the Brown and Hatton piggery group which had been writing off as bad debts hundreds of thousands of dollars owed by the members of the group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Writing off these bad debts within the group involves directors of one company, Messrs Constantinidis and Christopher, certifying that the debts are irrecoverable while at the same time being directors of the debtor companies making sworn statements that these companies can meet their debts as and when they fall due. These statements are irreconcilable. On what basis did these directors on the one hand say the money was irrecoverable while at the same time claiming that the debts could be paid as and when they fall due?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company's unaudited and inadequate 1989 annual return filed by Mr Constantinidis on 22 May 1992 has been entirely demolished by the auditors. Directors had reported a loss of $26,439, assets of $2.8 million, liabilities of $2.82 million and, in another favourable `typographical error', a positive shareholders' equity of $26,439 instead of a negative one. However, Olympia's audited accounts show no such figures existing for 1989 at all. The comparative audited figures for 1989 show no profit or loss, $6 in assets, $4 in liabilities and $2 in shareholders' equity. They do not reveal how these are compatible with an audited source and application of funds table showing outflows of $6,296,342 in 1989 and inflows of $6,759,513. The auditor and directors should make up their minds which of them is telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other examples of lax auditing include wrongly attributing amounts owing to other group companies as owing from them. For example, in 1991 Brown and Hatton Rural's trade debtors include $1.24 million payable to&mdash;instead of from&mdash;Brown and Hatton Wholesale where the reverse of this error appears in its annual return. Rural has also lent $518,864 interest free to the Brown and Hatton Group, not the other way round as it reports. Brown and Hatton Wholesale's interest free loan of $1.5 million is to the holding company not from it. Jensay's receivables included $1.29 million owing from&mdash;not to&mdash;related companies. And these were in audited accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst instance of actual breaches of auditing standards is in the last of the four versions of the debt owing to Mr John Brown via his now struck-off company, Brown and Hatton Pty Ltd. The first, filed on 10 July 1992 recorded it as a debt offsetting an asset, goodwill, of the same amount. The second on 25 November 1992 magically removed the $4.45 million from being a liability to becoming a part of shareholders' equity. The third on 10 December 1992 had it disappear by being reclassified as a `contingent liability' of $4 million that would only be payable out of profits. Finally, on 22 December 1992 it reappeared in the audited accounts as a `subordinated loan' written down to $2.76 million as a part of shareholders' funds, despite the fact that Mr Brown had never been a shareholder of the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd and that his one hundred $1 redeemable preference shares in Euphron Pty Ltd, his only equity in the whole group, had been redeemed at par in August 1991, 17 months before these accounts were signed by the auditors and directors on 17 December 1992. At that time they had full knowledge that Brown was not entitled to any of the equity of the group whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Directors had also made a sworn declaration that since the balance date in June 1991, nothing material had affected the state of affairs of the group. But its `state of affairs' would certainly have been affected by no longer being able to pretend this multi-million dollar debt was shareholders' equity and had to become a liability. In any event, the Australian Security Commission's statement of accounting concepts clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subordinated loans possess the essential characteristics of liabilities and should be recognised as such in a statement of financial position.</PARA>
<PARA>Reclassifying this debt as equity is simply wrong and the auditor should never have approved of it as it improperly indicates that the company is stronger than it really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These fiddled accounts were all about putting on a false front. They are a disgrace and reveal the inadequacy of the regulatory mechanism. In recent weeks major changes in the piggery group's structure, its ownership, directorship&mdash;and of course its ownership as far as Mr Keating is concerned because he says he has `disposed' of his half ownership&mdash;and its debt have been made. I intend to deal with these matters in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The series of issues raised in Parts (1) to (6) of Senator Jones' questions are most appropriately addressed together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I noted in my response to a previous question on this subject, depending on the nature of the account to which the cheque is credited, banks in Australia pay interest or reduce overdrafts from the day a cheque is deposited. Banks do not maintain separate records of the amounts involved or interest accruing to customers during the clearing cycle. Interest credits shown on customer accounts include, but do not separately identify, interest paid on cheque deposits awaiting clearance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, banks' accounting systems do not identify separately interest earnings on funds invested during the clearing cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clearing cycle generates substantial fluctuations in the value of funds banks have available to invest from day to day; they will typically be lenders on one day and borrowers on the next. As a result, investment opportunities for these funds are for the most part very short-term. This points banks to the domestic overnight market, where the major borrowers and lenders are other banks, and dealers in the short-term money market. Rates offered and paid in this market closely reflect the stance on monetary policy, although day-to-day variations in liquidity will also have an impact. Rates are currently around 4.75 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to Part (7) of the question, cheque proceeds deposited to an account at the same branch of the bank on which they are drawn will not in the normal course, be immediately available to be withdrawn. However, I understand that most banks have arrangements that allow such cheques to be cleared immediately upon request by the depositor.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. A voucher system called Cruise Currency is used at Daikyo Australia Pty Ltd's resorts on Green and Fitzroy Islands. Of the tour vessels which provide services to these islands, cruise currency is also used on Great Adventures' vessels. Vouchers are fully redeemable for cash at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Commonwealth does not monitor the use of cruise currency. The system of requiring visitors to exchange their cash for some form of voucher is designed to enhance the holiday atmosphere and to centralise cash handling for greater security and administrative ease. This system is common around the world. For example, the resort operator, Club Med, has used "bar beads" as a medium of exchange for many years while casinos use "chips" of various values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The cruise currency system has been operational for around two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The cruise currency system does not provide a means by which foreign corporations can avoid accounting for income. Treasury advises that there is no illegality in the use of such a system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. The Government does not monitor the level of tourist expenditure at individual holiday resorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) I am advised that cruise currency is sold only at Great Adventures outlets, the Cairns International Hotel and Matson Plaza and that Daikyo does not make cruise currency available to visitors prior to their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. As there is no illegality involved in the use of cruise currency the Government believes that decisions relating to the operation of individual tourism enterprises should generally be determined by the operator on the basis of their own commercial judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Daikyo Australia Pty Ltd has been informed of the adverse reaction from some visitors to the use of cruise currency, which appears to be based an a misunderstanding of the operation of the voucher system. As a result, the company has invested additional resources to ensure visitors fully understand the system. In addition, I understand that the company is considering replacing the system with a magnetic card.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Under the project financed by the Asian Development Bank, the procurement of the fertiliser was the responsibility of the Government of Bangladesh, which agreed on the product specification with the supplier but did not carry out product verification prior to the shipment of the fertiliser to Bangladesh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asian Development Bank is not directly involved in the removal of the contaminated fertiliser supplied to farmers in Bangladesh.
