<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This notice of motion originates from Senator Ian Campbell seeking to obtain certain information from the minister responsible, the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, on the leases granted in relation to the Casselden Place building, particularly with regard to whether the property adjustment program funds, which are taxpayers' funds, were inappropriately used in this quasi-commercial situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate passed a motion requiring the minister to supply documents to answer Senator Campbell's questions. The Australian Democrats supported this motion, but the request was met with non-performance&mdash;the relevant documents were not disclosed. The Senate subsequently passed a motion censuring the minister. Since then there has been no response from either the minister concerned or the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this motion, which seeks to refer the matter to the Auditor-General, who will provide the answers sought by the Senate, solves the problem in this particular situation, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the matter remains unresolved in that the Senate made a request to a minister of the government to disclose certain information, that request was refused, the Senate has passed a resolution censuring the minister, and that has had no effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while this motion of mine, if passed&mdash;it looks as though it will be passed with the agreement of all parties&mdash;will resolve the impasse in this particular way in this particular matter, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we have an instance of the government contemptuously ignoring a request of the Senate.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)do the payments received by the agencies under the property adjustment program fairly compensate them for the variations in rental, and, if not, how did the amounts vary and why;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(j)does the rent that has been paid since 1 December 1992 reflect a discounting or subsidisation outside the range of normal commercial dealing;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I appreciate the indulgence of the chamber. The opposition will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Spindler. I have consulted with Senator Spindler on some of the wording in the motion. I think one or two points need to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Senator McMullan is in contempt of the Senate resolutions of 5 and 10 May to provide information to this chamber about the leases in Casselden Place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more information that becomes available through estimates committees on the Casselden Place leases the more I understand why Senator McMullan is in contempt of the Senate. It seems that the leases in Casselden Place are a national disgrace and that the Australian taxpayer has lost hundreds of millions of dollars through the Commonwealth deciding to build this building and then trying to cover up its gross mismanagement of the handling of this property matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a further disgrace that Senator McMullan should, however, be in contempt of the Senate. The sad fact is that had he abided by the order of the Senate it would have saved the taxpayer a hell of a lot of money. We will be requesting the Auditor-General to look into these matters. That will involve placing a further burden on the Auditor-General's office, which is already under enormous financial and time pressure. It is an inquiry that would not have taken place had Senator McMullan abided by the order of the Australian parliament to table the documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much look forward to the inquiry because the Auditor-General will be able to delve into the files that this government quite clearly wants to keep secret from the parliament. In his report the Auditor-General will be able to reveal what I suspect is one of the greatest property scandals in Australia. The Casselden Place scandal will make some of the corporate excesses of the 1980s pale into insignificance. I look forward to this inquiry by the Auditor-General, and I congratulate Senator Spindler for his initiative. I look forward to supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition does not oppose the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill 1994, but I give notice that I will move an amendment to the bill asking the government to abandon the training guarantee levy and not just suspend it for two years, as is the intent of the bill before the chamber. It is coalition policy to abandon the training guarantee levy. The fundamental reason for this is that governments cannot legislate for good management. Good management can only come about from competition, from businesses working in a competitive environment and from employees and employers working together to achieve a common goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training is only a small part of this, but a very important part. Training is a particular facet of the business environment that cannot be legislated for; it was a silly notion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, governments should be encouraging people to train. All businesses, if they want to succeed, put a lot into training. Peter Ritchie, the managing director of McDonald's, was quoted in the media as saying last week that the essence of successful competitive business is training, training, training. I agree with that. In the businesses that I had a hand in managing or guiding at board level we spent many times 1 1/2 per cent on training on all employees. Again, one cannot achieve international best practice and be competitive unless one does those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of introducing a legislative penalty into the community to encourage businesses is the wrong way to go about things. The government should be persuading businesses to go into training by showing them what successful businesses are doing and by trying to get more people to face up to being internationally competitive. Both the government and the coalition acknowledge that the reduction in tariffs, which makes the business community more competitive, has been a good step in the right direction, and more people in the Australian community now understand the need to be competitive. I stress again that competition is the key to success in business and it is the key to getting all employees, managers, and owners in particular, to understand the need for training. It cannot be done by legislation, particularly legislation with penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own Kelty report suggested that the training guarantee levy should be suspended for three years. We in the coalition urge the government to give employers a real help, a real incentive to start investing from that very low investment base which we have in front of us today, by removing the training guarantee permanently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> refers to Ms Susan Young, the national tax director from Pannell Kerr Forster. She said that by simply suspending the training guarantee levy, employers will still have the costs of running administrative systems. In other words, details of all employees will still have to be kept with regard to training in case the training guarantee levy is reintroduced at the end of the two-year suspension period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill 1994 effectively suspends the training guarantee levy for two years. We support the bill and we welcome the government's progress towards the adoption of the proposals that were put forward by the Australian Democrats at budget time. In our 1994-95 budget submission we recommended a suspension of the training guarantee levy. At that time we recommended a suspension for three years and a replacement of that levy with a 10 per cent training investment allowance. We see some progress towards that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge and support Senator Gibson's call for incentives rather than punitive measures. I recall depicting that in one of my press releases at the time as the need for more carrot and less stick. We have here some progress towards that with the removal of the stick; however, we are still waiting for the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats understand the fundamental importance of training in the workplace&mdash;especially in times of rapid change such as we are witnessing now&mdash;and the need for skill development and re-skilling as entry level jobs are harder to come by. In our support for this bill we do not see that we are deviating from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats supported the introduction of the training guarantee levy in 1990, but at that time we also made clear our concerns about the nature of the levy legislation. At that time we welcomed in principle the concept of the training guarantee levy as a means of ensuring a more equitable distribution of the costs of training amongst employers in Australia but moved a series of amendments. Those amendments sought partial devolution of the responsibility for the bill's administration away from the Australian Taxation Office to peak industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also sought the inclusion of a depreciation clause for capital expenditure on training and an exemption from some of the more specific requirements of the bill for those firms that could demonstrate that they already had and would continue to have exceptional commitment to training. We also sought the inclusion of study leave, occupational health and safety, and industrial relations as eligible training expenditure. At that time we succeeded in removing some of the elements of uncertainty which were evident in the draft bill, and here I thank former Senator Michael Macklin who succeeded in making major changes to the bill with regard to accountability and methodology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats consulted widely with different industry, academic and union bodies at that time and have done so since to determine their attitudes towards the legislation. We find that many of our initial concerns are reflected in the problems that have arisen with the legislation over the years. Those problems include such things as the dubious accreditation of some training schemes and certain practices which could only be described as rorts on the part of both employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the last set of training guarantee amendments came before the Senate, the Democrats referred them to a Senate standing committee in the belief that it was time for a review of some of the claims that have been made about the scheme, its benefits and its disadvantages. At that time we were particularly concerned about the number of employers who were paying money directly to the taxation department. As I recall, something like $5 million had been paid directly to the taxation department in lieu of spending that money on training or in lieu of making a donation to an education institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the time that I really could not understand why anybody would not make a donation to an educational institution rather than be required to pay the levy because, as Senator Watson would know, such a donation is tax deductible. I was amazed that businesses made themselves liable for that levy but part of the reason was the administratively heavy and time consuming calculations that needed to be made to determine just what was payable. So some businesses adopted the attitude of, `I can't be bothered dealing with all the calculations here, I will just pay whatever I have to pay.' That pointed to another deficiency in the scheme&mdash;the onus was at that time placed on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the Democrats also expressed concern about where this money was being directed. Was the money that was received by the ATO going back to the states, as originally promised, or was it simply being used for the administration of the levy? Of course, the administration of the levy was costing more than was being collected. It was never intended to be self-funding from its collections&mdash;the government at the time probably hoped that it would not collect very much money at all&mdash;but that was not the problem. The problem was what was happening to the money that was being collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were our concerns. Nevertheless, we have long supported the increase of educational and training opportunities in this country. We also support the concept that there should be greater responsibility by employers towards training. We have never supported outright the opposition to the scheme which sometimes has been expressed by the coalition. We have simply looked at its faults of administration or its delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard consistent complaints about the training guarantee levy. Even before its implementation in July 1990 it was criticised&mdash;before it had a chance to take effect. The complaints have ranged from practical concerns, some of which we share, to other expressions which are simply a philosophical rejection of encouraging training, a philosophical position which is that the market is supreme and will determine all that is good. We reject that just as that position rejects the concept of encouraging training by government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Democrats' ongoing commitment to small business, which has been a feature of our policy since our inception, we are concerned about the rising on-costs, compliance costs, for business. I see Senator Panizza's ears twitching as soon I say that because he has been a constant advocate of looking at ways to reduce those costs as well. We recognise these costs, especially their effect on smaller to medium sized enterprises. More than half of all new jobs created in Australia since 1990 have been in small businesses. We believe as a party that this sector must be nurtured. It is the backbone of our country and that has not been denied by anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that on average employers spent the equivalent of 2.9 per cent of gross wages and salaries on formal training in the September quarter of 1993. That amounts to $1.1 billion on formal training. We acknowledge that there is a considerable amount of on-the-job training which is not identified in that figure. Per employee, that figure represents employers spending $192, a rise of 18 per cent since 1990. That was the time of the introduction of the training guarantee levy. In 1990 employers spent $163 per employee on training. So in fact there has been an increase in the amount spent on training in Australia. However, the amount of time spent in training by employees was reduced from 5.9 hours in 1990 to 5.6 hours in that September quarter I quoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are listening can appreciate immediately that it is difficult to evaluate whether this scheme has encouraged money spent in a worthwhile sense on training. It may be possible to identify an increased amount, but whether this scheme has been responsible for it is difficult to determine. It may simply have been the wisdom of the employers, recognising that training provides a benefit in greater skill and productivity of the workers. It is also impossible to evaluate the quality of the training that has been conducted. While we notice a reduction in the hours, there is no measure which can determine whether those hours were more efficiently spent in the training sense than were the previous set of hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have a situation where the Public Service spends a higher proportion of wages and salaries on training than does the private sector. The most marked difference is in the ACT. Some might say, `Well, that could be predicted,' but in the ACT the fact is that the public sector spent 5.4 per cent of wages and salaries on training compared with the private sector which spent only 1.8 per cent. Again, though, that may be a function of the size of the enterprises involved and the nature of the enterprises involved. So the raw figures make it very difficult to evaluate either the quality or the reasons for training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to what has been water under the bridge in this whole debate. Some of the justifications for the original scheme and some of the excuses given for not considering a suspension of the scheme earlier are excuses which we are still hearing. I would like to address those. I remind the Senate that at the inquiry which I made reference to earlier&mdash;the previous time this bill was before the chamber I referred it to a committee&mdash;Senator Schacht, who was at the time representing the minister and responsible for small business, in presenting evidence reminded the committee that there are approximately 800,000 small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee was told that only 70,000 of those businesses were required to meet the training guarantee levy. Only 70,000 businesses qualified by dint of being within the payroll threshold. So, obviously, 730,000 small businesses have not been affected one way or another by the application of this levy. The committee was also told by the Australian Taxation Office that only 500 out of the 800,000 small businesses did not take the trouble to meet their requirements and therefore had to pay some sort of levy. The amount derived from that in 1992-93 was $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be keep that fact in mind when we hear justifications being trotted out for the claim that this scheme is going to solve the problems of occupational health and safety non-compliance, ignorance in work practices and the lack of training provided by all employers. It could never do that if 730,000 small businesses were not included in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the difficulty of evaluating the quality of training provided. I remind the Senate that the very problems that were supposed to be solved remain untouched because of the number of businesses not caught up in the scheme. We heard a lot about this in the debate in the other place. The honourable member for Bass, Mrs Silvia Smith, quoted to us some findings from the ACTU's national occupational health and safety coordinator, Ms Renata Musolino, who said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most employers provided adequate training but many companies, particularly small businesses, neglected their responsibilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>especially in occupational health and safety. We were told in that debate in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training guarantee slots straight in with the concept of the level playing field. It also means that the good corporate citizens who train their employees do not have their staff poached by corporate parasites who do not train. This is achieved by the blanket requirements of the training guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it is anything but a blanket requirement because of the reliance on that payroll threshold. The effect was the opposite. Those small businesses that were large enough to be caught within that net were penalised. At least 730,000 small business were able to abrogate their responsibilities and therefore the scheme did not do what it was claimed to do. It did not provide blanket coverage and it did not provide a guarantee from poaching by lazy employers who wanted somebody else spend the money in that area for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to ensure that employers recognise and provide training particularly in the area of occupational health and safety. This scheme never did, and never could, force people to meet their obligations. Apart from this scheme being incapable of guaranteeing quality training, it is also incapable of guaranteeing blanket coverage. Keeping those inadequacies in mind, I believe we are doing the right thing in ensuring that there is a proper revision of this scheme. While recognising its faults, the scheme will be discontinued while that revision takes place and this whole business addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will allow employers with a shortfall in the 1993 financial year to pay by September 1994, or they can postpone the shortfall and provide training in the two years of the suspension. The bill is expected to have minimum financial impact. In fact, the explanatory memorandum states that there will be a small saving in administrative costs. I would be curious to hear the amount that the government expects to save from these amendments. I think we have already canvassed that idea, so I will not toy with it any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to hear the government saying that the reason for suspending the training guarantee levy is that it has achieved its purpose. Any attempt to use figures of increased spending or figures which show a greater number of participants is susceptible to the accusation that the government does not know the cause of the increased spending, does not know what the effect of that increased spending has been or could be. If the government trots out that line, we should view it with cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Kelty task force on regional development has been mentioned. We should acknowledge its recommendation that the training guarantee levy on businesses should be suspended for three years. It also recommended that company tax rates should be increased by one percentage point and that companies which take on trainees or apprentices would be able to deduct all unsubsidised costs for such employees from the one per cent, in addition to the normal wage deduction allowable from before-tax costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread endorsement of the objective of this bill, which suspends the TGL for two years. Perhaps during that time we can examine any attitudinal changes there might have been towards training in this country. Perhaps in that time we will recognise and be able to correct the faults of using too much stick and not enough carrot. The Democrats support the amendment moved by Senator Gibson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up much of the Senate's time today in speaking to the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill 1994. I believe that very little can be added to the huge volume of criticism that the government's training guarantee scheme has received, particularly over the past few years and more recently in this very chamber during the debate on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill in March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the removal of the training guarantee was very much a part of the Liberal Party's Fightback package. What we have today is not a removal but merely a two-year suspension&mdash;a suspension that had its origins in the white paper proposal to actually suspend the training guarantee for just two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate for the business community that it took the government three years to realise that employers were actually providing training to employees prior to the introduction of the training guarantee. But this government, as we all know, is very arrogant. The explanatory memorandum says that the government believes that employers have now recognised the value of training and will continue to play their role in increasing Australia's skills base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that employers have always known the value of training. The training guarantee scheme was not responsible for the realisation that prompted that comment in the explanatory memorandum. The training guarantee, as has now been recognised across this chamber, has been an impost on business&mdash;and employment&mdash;and has resulted in an extraordinarily high administrative cost for employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry clearly showed the government over the past few years that it was committed to meeting its training obligations. The fact that in 1992-93 only $1.4 million was raised by the Australian Taxation Office from employers not meeting the required level of training shows that, apart from rorting of the scheme&mdash;and we are very critical of the rorts and the shortcomings in the legislative processes that attempted to bring about such training and the inadequacies in that sort of scheme&mdash;employers were largely fulfilling their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the government should now abolish the training guarantee scheme altogether. The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have been saying this over a long period. In other words, we should not be procrastinating. We should not be wasting our time looking at this bill and then maybe in two years hence looking at another short bill which we hope will abolish the training guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, yet again, this government is arrogant in saying that the training guarantee will be abolished if employers give a credible commitment to providing the training places required in the white paper strategy. We believe that the government should be creating training places, not threatening employers with a stick called the training guarantee if they do not create the government's idea of training places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn quickly to the commencement of the suspension of the scheme. The effect of the suspension will not be any bonus for employers who have a shortfall in the 1993-94 year since they must either pay the shortfall by 30 September 1994 or elect to make up the shortfall during the following two years. I think it is important that the Senate and all employers should take note of the fact that there is no guarantee that the scheme will not be reintroduced in two years if this Labor government is still there. I urge all employers to continue the structure of their training and their administrative arrangements. If the training guarantee should be reintroduced in 1996-97, expenditure incurred in the intervening years could be carried forward to offset shortfalls in 1996-97. I hope employers and honourable senators will heed those comments. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the Greens, the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill is an embodiment of the government's approach to economic development and industry. It says that industry need have no commitment to training its own employees and that this is acceptable. I think back to some of my own experiences from 1974, when I was taken on as an employee of Qantas Airways. I went through a series of training procedures that lasted a number of years to go from one level to the other in airline procedures, international codings, fares and ticketing and reservations procedures. Qantas produced some of the best trained people in the industry and those people, once they had worked for Qantas for a number of years, were very much sought after. They were paid high rates by other companies, who saw the value of the training the national airline provided. These days, I believe, people have to go to night school at government expense or at their own expense to get fares and ticketing training before they can be taken on even by the national carrier, Qantas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government assures us that industry will continue to train workers and that this bill simply makes the paperwork less onerous. If the paperwork is such a problem, why does it not review the procedures? There is always a need for ongoing improvement of such procedures. The government should be pursuing this option rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Simply to claim that the paperwork is too much and the levy is too onerous and then suspend the whole program for two years without apparent review is ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers should have some responsibility to train workers. Unfortunately, due to the failure of some to acknowledge this responsibility, this program was implemented. The Greens do not feel that the need for such a regulatory approach has disappeared. There are still employers who do not feel the need for training. One has only to look at the growing concern about the quality of management and middle management in Australia. We are not just talking about a lack of commitment to training workers from the ground up, as I was suggesting earlier; we are talking about companies which do not see the need to train their management in modern best practice and in ways of implementing democratisation of the work force, instead of trying to make workers and unions the enemy and keeping the workers under control by various means. So there is a great deal of evidence that training, in the full sense, is greatly needed in our society. </PARA>

It is of particular concern that the opportunity for an ongoing review of industry commitment to training has been lost. It appears that the only reporting commitment will be in relation to funds carried over from the 1993-94 financial year. Where, then, is the data for a quantitative and qualitative review of industry training? I trust that the government will address this important issue prior to the expiration of the suspension period for the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that industry has made little commitment in relation to taking trained workers; quite the reverse. It has been explicit in saying that it should not have any responsibility for the problems in our society or its part in it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens feel that this bill, which eliminates the need for a proper commitment by employers to training, is a reflection of this lack of commitment by industry leaders to the social and economic needs of the society in which they operate and from which they profit.

In supporting this Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill we note that the levy should never have been implemented initially. Rather than merely suspending the levy, the coalition would hope to see it abolished. Senator Gibson has moved an amendment to this effect. The Training Guarantee Act is an absurd piece of legislation that required employers with minimum annual payrolls of $222,000 to spend at least 1.5 per cent of their payroll on eligible training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the start there were drawbacks to this legislation. There is no requirement for firms to have their training accredited. There have been allegations that up to 30 per cent of the total of $1 billion spent on the training guarantee levy has been misused, with training seminars being held in extremely unlikely places, as detailed by Senator Margetts, and dubious practices, as detailed by Senator Bell. The training guarantee levy is yet another example of a tax on jobs that inhibits employment. The increased cost of record keeping in regard to training expenditure in many cases works to the detriment of expenditure on individuals. Indeed, the government-sponsored McKinsey report noted that 28 per cent of respondents considered on-costs, including the training guarantee levy, to be an impediment to investment. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(on-costs are considered) a significant irritant affecting the willingness of business to invest and employ additional people.</PARA>
<PARA>It has taken the government four years to suspend this levy&mdash;this absurd and dictatorial approach to training. Who knows how many jobs have been lost as a result of it. Resources for employers have been scarce enough in the last four years; and money spent on paperwork cannot then provide salary or wages for an additional employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the government's training reform agenda, as outlined in the white paper, is little better. All that the new training programs will do is shuffle numbers between unemployment queues and training programs. There is still no real prospect of a job at the end of the training. Without real private sector investment, the government will have to continue a very high level of spending on labour market programs to maintain the charade that people are being trained for jobs. Without real growth, unemployment will simply dip artificially for the life of the white paper measures, and then rise again when the life of the program expires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was canvassed in this place in May, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the department responsible for running these programs, has had serious allegations of abuse and fraud made against it. Very serious doubts have been raised about the ability of DEET to administer these hugely expensive programs in an accountable and effective manner. In addition, the white paper did not outline any industry policy or plan for reducing unemployment. There is still no incentive for business to take on more employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry report, 61.1 per cent of respondents said that, in order to raise the level of employment, the reduction of on-costs was extremely important; 53 per cent of respondents said that the easing of award restrictions was very important in raising the level of employment; and 52.3 per cent said that easing termination restrictions was very important in order to increase employment. All of the factors I have mentioned are very important in the ability of employers to employ. Until we see a rise in the level of that ability, there will be no long-term solutions to Australia's unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government learns anything from the suspension of the training guarantee levy, it ought to be that decreasing taxes on business and removing restrictive business legislation is the only way to get real job growth. Suspension, rather than abolition, adds an element of uncertainty to the business plans of employers. Merely to say that the levy will be suspended for two years means that employers have no idea what will happen at the end of that time, and they may yet have to devote additional funds to the training of employees. Abolishing the training guarantee levy outright, as recommended by the coalition, would at least be a start to reducing the high level of unemployment and getting Australia going again. </PARA>

In this instance, the government at least recognised that Mr Kelty had expressed some concern about the training guarantee levy. Mr Kelty's recommendation was that it be suspended for three years. The government has picked two years. I am not quite sure of the justification for that. As Senator Gibson quite rightly pointed out, it should be abolished altogether, as we proposed before the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to flag to the Senate another aspect of Mr Kelty's report. Because of the influence he has on this government and the Labor Party, it is worth raising here. Mr Kelty is proposing that company tax go up by one per cent to fund some other form of training. I do not think that in this debate or in the government's proposals to date there has been any suggestion of additional taxes to fund training, but one has to be suspicious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is well known as the high tax government, the big spending government. One must be suspicious, in view of what Mr Kelty has recommended in his report, about just what the government has in mind. I would like Senator Cook to give us an unequivocal rejection of any new taxes in the training area, although I suspect that even if we do get some unequivocal guarantee from Senator Cook, it will not mean anything because this is the government that went to the last election promising no new taxes and criticising our proposal for the removal of the training guarantee levy. Without so much as a blush, it has now changed its mind and acted directly contrary to the promises it made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promises not to increase taxes go out the window immediately an election is over. I suspect it is a waste of my time asking Senator Cook to give any sort of guarantee. Even if he were minded to give one, as we know, we really cannot trust anything any minister in this government says or promises because their promises are broken with impunity as soon as the immediate crisis&mdash;the election or whatever it happens to be&mdash;is out of the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the Senate to be aware of Mr Kelty's proposals and to be aware that the ACTU boss thinks that the removal of the training guarantee levy should be accompanied by some form of tax increase. This government has big tax deficits. The events of recent days and weeks show the government's mismanagement of the finances of the country is causing real problems and even real terror in the interest rate area. Interest rates are again forecast to increase, and there is some evidence of that already. It all comes back to the government's irresponsibility in managing the economy and producing budget after budget with receipts not meeting expenditure. In considering this legislation, those points are something of which the Senate should take note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to support Senator Gibson's amendment to completely get rid of this levy. I am not quite sure why it is proposed to suspend it for two years, or three years as Mr Kelty proposes, when it is a good idea to get it off the statute book altogether. I urge the Senate to support Senator Gibson's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill, including the amendment, has a very long history going back to the time when I first entered this parliament. It was one of the very first matters that I spoke on in the parliament. I well remember our considerable concerns about what the government was doing with the training guarantee at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that what the government was trying to do was sound enough in principle because the Prime Minister at that time was claiming that he wanted us to become a clever country. To become a clever country we obviously needed a lot more training. As we have developed over this century, our training levels have been well below those of countries with which we have been competing, particularly Japan, the United States and Germany. So there was a need to increase training. But the government went about this in an extremely insensitive and inappropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided, I suppose because of Mr Dawkins who was minister at the time&mdash;he seemed to have all these eastern European type solutions to everything&mdash;that in education things must be very centralised and be directed from the top. We certainly found that in higher education and, when it came to training, we discovered a similar sort of thing was happening. He was going to levy all businesses initially one per cent, and later 1 1/2 per cent, to make sure that they trained people. The problem is, of course, that that is totally insensitive to the situation of particular businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the unfortunate history of this training guarantee legislation we have found companies for whom it is inappropriate to spend 1 1/2 per cent of their money on training, either because their staff are well trained or because they are in a sort of business where training levels naturally only need to be low. For example, why would a company laying carpet need to spend 1 1/2 per cent each year on the training of carpet layers? The levy was insensitive to that. On the other hand we had companies&mdash;for instance, the Tweed Valley Processing Company up in the northern rivers&mdash;spending 8 1/2 per cent on training because of the nature of the exercise. So setting a levy at a particular point is a nonsense, as the present outcome&mdash;the amending legislation&mdash;has proved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also found that a number of companies, regardless of how much training they were doing, amended what they were doing to this level. We had the rather strange situation where people who were spending maybe three per cent on training realised that they were only going to get deductions for 1 1/2 per cent and so reduced training levels. So while some were increasing the amount of training as a result of the training guarantee, others were reducing it. The net effect of all this was very little increase in the overall levels of training in the country. What the training guarantee did do to business&mdash;and this is particularly sad as it was brought in during the great recession&mdash;was give it yet another onerous government burden to fulfil. Businesses had a lot more paperwork to do. In a lot of cases funds were distorted, as businesses tried to spend up to a particular artificial level. The training guarantee created great difficulties for business in a difficult time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was with some relief, when the government had finally seen the light, about six months ago, that it proposed some changes to the system. When those changes were first mooted we welcomed them as adjustments to the system, for example, the way amounts could be averaged out over time. We thought that sort of adjustment was a good idea, but we felt that the government should go a lot further. We said at the time that the government should abolish this legislation as a very unfair impost on business. But the government has not done that. It is proposing in this legislation&mdash;a proposal I find curious&mdash;to suspend the training guarantee for two years. Why? Either it is working, after the government's assessment from 1991 to now, or it is not working. </PARA>

It is not the way to go in training. During the last election campaign we criticised it severely. We put up an alternative range of education measures that could achieve the same effects. In particular, getting government off the back of business and giving businesses more financial flexibility to carry out the training that is proper and desirable for each type of business would see a much better outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill is one of the first of a batch of bills to flow from the white paper on employment released early last month. It is a bill which the Australian Democrats support. As my colleague Senator Bell has outlined, this was one of the aspects of the white paper which conformed with the recommendations contained in our budget proposals to the government which we released in March. In those proposals we too called for the suspension of the training guarantee for three years and its replacement with a 10 per cent training investment allowance. The reasoning behind this was simple: we felt that the big stick approach to encouraging training, as represented by the training guarantee levy, had gone as far as it could have. It was time to attempt a carrot approach through the use of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the training guarantee when it was introduced was an experimental piece of legislation, breaking new ground, I think it is appropriate to review its operation and to explore alternative means of improving our still very poor vocational record. Senator Bell has dealt with the history of the guarantee and the Democrats involvement in that, but I want to add to the debate our view that this bill and the white paper package in general do not go far enough to encourage training and to reduce employment on-costs. Unfortunately, it is typical of the entire white paper, which was, in typical fashion these days, very big on rhetoric, very big on hugely exaggerated spending figures, but very small on real commitment and needed reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) laid on the rhetoric about the $6.5 billion of so-called new spending in the white paper over the next four years. We all recall his trumpeting of a $1.1 billion figure for this year and a $1.7 billion figure for the year after. He described this as his helping hand to the unemployed, a demonstration of Labor's great commitment to the unemployed and the less well off. `Ben Chifley,' he said, `would have been proud.' Ben Chifley, honest family man that he was, would not have put his name to such a deceptive set of figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in the first full year of the white paper, 1995-96, this government will not be spending more; it will be spending less in real terms on employment-related programs than it did in this financial year. Instead of an extra $1.7 billion, on the most optimistic projection there will be $70 million less spent in 1995-96 on total employment-related programs. These include labour market programs, the training and employment services areas, science, manufacturing industry and income support programs. If we include infrastructure spending, the situation is even worse. In 1995-96 the government will be spending $1.3 billion less in real terms than in 1993-94. That rises to $1.5 billion dollars less in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government in its white paper recognises the importance of infrastructure in generating employment, especially in regional Australia. Yet its spending on infrastructure will fall by almost $1 billion in the first full year of the white paper's operation. Take away the first big day's headlines and look at the reality of the figures, and it is less, not more. In the worst possible case, assuming employment growth meets the 1993 budget estimates of 2.5 per cent and 2.75 per cent for the next two years, the white paper looks pretty paltry indeed. In fact, it results in $2.3 billion less being spent on employment-related programs in 1995-96 and $3.3 billion less in 1996-97. Given that employment growth is now slowing, this second scenario is not as extreme as it might first appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the current year, on the most optimistic projections available the additional spending in real terms on employment-related programs is just $254 million. No-one is going to say that we do not want that. The point I am making is that this is a quarter of the $1.1 billion that the Prime Minister has been trumpeting around this country. If we include infrastructure, the government will be spending $437 million less this year than last year in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has the government managed to get away with this fiddle? The so-called new spending on programs in the white paper is not new spending over and above what is to be spent in 1993-94&mdash;there is a little bit of cleverness going on here; it is new spending against the forward estimates published in the 1993-94 budget, and those estimates were always quite a bit unrealistic, I think. They appear to have been set not at realistic expenditure goals for the following year but rather to lend some support to the government's contention that it could meet its deficit reduction strategy of one per cent by 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we have total expenditure in 1994-95 that is $1 billion higher than the forward estimates projected and&mdash;here is the rub&mdash;precious little of that is going into employment related programs. Take training, for example. Increasingly, governments all over the world recognise that employment and economic prosperity depend heavily on the skills of the work force and this Labor government has recognised that. But according to the 1994-95 budget papers, notwithstanding the new initiatives in the white paper, spending on vocational training will fall by $5 million in real terms in 1994-95 and will fall by $19 million in real terms in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper contains many training initiatives which the Democrats welcome. The youth training initiative, for example, has a bit of a resemblance to the youth guarantee proposal announced by us two years ago and we welcome suspension of the training guarantee, but these initiatives, it appears, are to be paid for by taking from other vital training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our budget proposals to the government we called for an overhaul of the taxation system to encourage investment in human capital. The government provides a $3 billion incentive to invest in physical capital but allows a $6 billion tax disincentive to invest in labour. We argued to the government that the abolition of the training guarantee should be combined, not just suspended or abolished outright, but that we should do something constructive. We should combine this with the phase-out of payroll tax to even up the tax system choice between investment in capital and investment in labour. We demonstrated, we believe, that it was possible to suspend the training guarantee to provide tax incentives to encourage training and to phase out payroll tax without affecting the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With suspension of the training guarantee we are less than halfway there to a tax system which is more friendly to employment. With the clear aversion states such as Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland have shown to payroll tax in their recent budgets, I really believe that the federal government could and should have made a reasonable offer to phase out the current tax and replace it with a new growth tax sharing arrangement. We believe that up to 200,000 new jobs could have been funded through a different tax mix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we will support this bill even though, like the white paper, it does not go anywhere near far enough to addressing the overall restrictions and tax induced on-costs on labour. We will be closely assessing all of the 40-odd pieces of legislation that will come to the parliament out of the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper really is a bit of a snow job. We will be seeking to make sure that the Prime Minister does in fact provide a helping hand to the unemployed without using his spare hand to raid the pockets of the unemployed and others. Bills such as those taking $96 million out of the pockets of up to 100,000 unemployed people through a tougher means test and outrageously excessive penalty clauses will not attract our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment will not go away just because the government says it has addressed the problem, particularly when it says it has addressed the problem in such a dishonest way. There are still people suffering out there and they deserve better treatment than the rhetoric which has been exposed as fiddling the books and fiddling their pockets. </PARA>

It is obvious that the bill will now pass this chamber, and it is important that it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said that a nation's greatest asset is its people, and nothing is more true of Australia than that statement. Yet the sad fact is that Australia over many years, until this government came to power, has progressively been deskilled. In modern society we see that apprentices graduating from their indentures and becoming tradespersons will during their employment life have to be trained or retrained between three and eight times in order to keep pace with the exploding changes in technology and with the changes in new processes and new ways of doing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skill and training is a lifelong commitment. It is no longer a commitment that ends with graduation. The dynamics of a modern industrial society require this training and retraining to be done. We all know that; we have all recognised it. But when we look at the behavioural patterns in Australia over the last couple of decades we see that, rather than employers committing to training schemes to ensure that the skills possessed by their work forces remain up to date with trends in technology and competitive change elsewhere in the economy, they have by and large not done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are notable exceptions. There are many good employers in this country for whom that remark is not true. They have done it, and they have reaped the benefit of ensuring that their work force is highly skilled, better able to take up new technology, and better able to adapt to change. Those employers have succeeded in winning on behalf of their companies a greater share of the market. The truth is that the great bulk of Australian employers have not done that. They have tended to supplement shortfalls in skill, when they have occurred, by immigration, encouraging people to migrate to Australia and recruiting them off the boat or the plane, supplementing their skill shortfalls in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the cyclical nature of the economy, with its up and down phases, it has always been clear to me that the building industry is a perfect example. When building activities falter with an economic downturn, skilled building workers leave the industry. Given the insecurity they have experienced and the disruption to their lives, it is very hard to attract them back into the industry, although there has been a huge investment in their training. Once bitten, twice shy. Rather than have an ongoing training program, the industry has encouraged migration whenever there has been an upturn, and that has meant that the recovery of the economy has been slowed because there is a temporary gap of skill until the migrants have come into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have locked out from trade qualifications or long-term employment prospects people who, in the downturn, would have been trained as apprentices had the economy been going on at a reasonable rate. Because there were no job opportunities they were not trained, and later their jobs were taken by migrants. This government said that that ought to change, that we ought to become more self-reliant as a nation, that we ought to skill our community, that we ought to make sure that the skills of Australians are updated as we go along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government recognises that there is a responsibility on it and, through it, on the taxpayer to help fund some of these training schemes, the government also recognises that there is an obligation on employers to make a contribution too. The smart, intelligent employers who make that contribution know that that gives their company a greater degree of flexibility, a greater degree of meeting change and a greater degree of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the burden was still that a huge number of employers in this country would not recognise that, had a narrow cost cutting approach to their operations and believed that somehow or other they could pick up skills when they wanted them in the economy. It meant bidding up prices for labour as well and that added to the cyclical nature of upturn, downturn in the cycle. What we said as a government was that there ought to be a levy on employers to spend at least 1 1/2 per cent of their payroll on training&mdash;a modest amount compared to what the enlightened employers were doing and a modest amount by international standards&mdash;and that the paucity of skills, the run down and the de-skilling of our society, should be turned around and employers should share part of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been doing that. It met initial hostility and opposition from many employers who opposed it vigorously. In my portfolio, as I move around the country, I do not hear that criticism any more. I hear a number of employers who say to me, `Thank God we were required to face up to our responsibilities, because now that we have come to grips with it we see what you were on about. In fact, we are now spending more than the 1 1/2 per cent that the levy requires in order to keep our work force skills up to date and always relevant to the needs of the market and the technology change that we are using. If this levy did anything, it caused us to focus on training and skilling and devote some attention to that in our corporate plans, and we have reaped the benefit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first thing that this levy has done is caused an attitudinal change among employers, and I think that is worth noting. Without it, this training would not have occurred. I have heard the criticism from the opposition that we should get off the back of employers. It does not sound to me, given what the employers are saying, as though we are on their back. It sounds to me as though this has provided a catalyst or the stimulus necessary for an attitudinal change for a modern industrial country. I think that that is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some who still run behind the pack, but the figures I have in front of me show that before the training guarantee levy, nearly 60 per cent of all employers in this country with payrolls in excess of $200,000&mdash;and a payroll of $200,000 is not a big payroll in Australia&mdash;provided no structured training at all. Now, nearly all of those employers over that threshold provide training equal to at least 1.5 per cent of their payroll. So the investment in skilling this nation and lifting its level of skill has been important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue before this chamber now is whether we should suspend the levy or whether we should abolish it. The opposition's position is to abolish it. I do not think, nor does the government, that the work of the levy has yet been done. There is a case that we recognise and are acting on by virtue of these amendments articulated by the Prime Minister in the Working Nation statement, that since we are asking employers to commit themselves to pick up a number of the unemployed and train them in a much more comprehensive and extensive training program with a training wage negotiated at an attractive level for employers, we should remove this imposition to allow that training wage and the jobs compact approach to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, we are temporarily suspending this levy. I think that is sensible. We are working here cooperatively with employers and unions to lift the level of employment and the level of skill so that the jobs we create are not painting rocks white or labouring jobs with no future, but are jobs in which people can have a future because they are real and result from skill and understanding of new technology. So we are suspending the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to remove the levy entirely, after the jobs compact has run its course and before we are able to see the take-up rate of the jobs compact, then the discipline of the training guarantee levy to continue with the encouragement and inducement of employers to commit their salary packages, in part, to training packages also would be removed. That would be wrong, because the attitudinal change is by no means complete. Although significant, it is not through to the keeper yet and we have not yet completed the revolution that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the reasons why I will oppose the amendment moved by the opposition that we abolish the levy. That leaves me with the Democrats' suggestion, which is a policy choice open to the government as to whether or not we should abolish the levy on employers and introduce a tax incentive for training. The question involved in this choice is whether employers or taxpayers, on behalf of employers, should make a bigger commitment to training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think it is essential that there be some cost to employers. If it comes without a cost to employers then it will not be valued and the approach will not be utilised properly because employers would not be required to face their own cost structures and work out their commitment to training. Given the huge commitment that the Australian taxpayer is making to the cost of the training and skilling of the Australian work force, it seems to be an inappropriate course of action. The Democrats, who put forward a lot of policy suggestions coming up to the budget and committed themselves to that process zealously, have come up with an overall budgetary package which means an increase in taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1994 currently before the Senate is the second superannuation bill that we have dealt with this year. It seeks to extend certain aspects of the superannuation industry supervision legislation to the superannuation benefits enjoyed by federal parliamentarians. I remind the Senate that in October last year we examined the SIS bills, a package of bills to supervise superannuation in relation to insurance, which imposed upon certain superannuation funds prudential controls aimed at ensuring the security of members' benefits. Those bills will largely come into operation in a few days time on 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although SIS exempts unfunded public sector superannuation schemes from the SIS arrangements, the government has decided, and we agree, that all Commonwealth schemes should comply with the main operative provisions of SIS. Generally they are what is known as vesting, preservation and disclosure. Having been involved very closely in this matter as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I say that this is a good thing. It brings the superannuation conditions of parliamentarians into line with those generally enjoyed in the general community. Too often politicians are criticised for living in an ivory tower but now we will be subject to the same rules and the same conditions as our constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to effect these changes the bill primarily amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. It also makes consequential amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1981 and the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Act 1983. As recently as 5 May we saw a bill, called the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, to extend the SIS type provisions to public sector superannuation schemes. That bill and the bill before us today will commence with the same types of conditions on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased that the parliamentary superannuation scheme will be subject to the SIS requirements given my very heavy involvement, as I said, in the superannuation area, particularly as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and also as a trustee of the parliamentary retiring allowances trust. The parliamentary superannuation scheme will be required to comply with SIS and associated regulations&mdash;I remind the Senate that those regulations are currently before our committee for evaluation&mdash;in relation not only to vesting and preservation of members' benefits and disclosure of information to members of the scheme but also to correcting inequities relating to former members who hold offices of profit, invalidity retirements and transfers between the Commonwealth, state and territory parliaments. There are also minor amendments to spouse benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to discuss firstly what is known as the vesting requirements. Vesting actually refers to the conferring on a superannuation fund member the ownership of all or part of the accrued benefit payable to that member. SIS and the superannuation guarantee legislation require that all employees receive a minimum level of employer sponsored superannuation support. I remind the Senate that in the 1993-94 financial year for employers with a payroll of less than $1 million the required level was three per cent and for those greater than $1 million the required level was five per cent. From 1 July employers with a payroll under $1 million will find that this level will rise to four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the parliamentary superannuation scheme, the government finances lump sum benefits payable on voluntary retirement of one and one-sixth times the member's contribution. This is regarded as meeting the five per cent superannuation guarantee minimum. However, where a member will not qualify for a pension, in some cases, the lump sum will not meet the prescribed standard. To meet this contingency, the bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to increase these lump sums to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation through the use of what is referred to as a `top-up' benefit where the benefits otherwise payable from the scheme fail to comply with the superannuation guarantee minimum requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major SIS requirement that the parliamentary superannuation scheme will adhere to is preservation. At present the parliamentary super scheme does not require members' superannuation benefits to be preserved. However, SIS requires certain lump sum benefits to be preserved in a superannuation or approved deposit fund until beneficiaries reach the preservation age which is currently 55 and retire from the work force, or be used to purchase a deferred annuity which cannot be accessed until the preservation age is reached. The bill will require the preservation of lump sum benefits in line with SIS conditions and requirements. This is important, because members of parliament should not be subject to rules as to preservation which are different from those applying to the majority of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of SIS that the parliamentary superannuation scheme will adhere to is the disclosure requirements. Currently, there are no obligations on the parliamentary superannuation scheme to disclose information to members. However, as all honourable senators would be aware, the scheme does provide us with an annual statement of accumulated benefits. I understand that the Department of Finance currently administers the scheme in full compliance with all disclosure requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that is before us will require that certain information be disclosed to members in line with the requirements of the SIS regulations. The regulations, which were formally gazetted on 11 March 1994 and, as I said, which are the subject of an inquiry at present by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, strengthen obligations on trustees to provide information to members and others so that there is a better understanding of benefit entitlements and the way the fund is managed. The disclosure requirements are of particular interest to me, as I said, as a trustee of the parliamentary retiring allowances trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations specify the information that must be provided to new members, to continuing members on the occurrence of an important event, when there is a request for information, and to members leaving the fund. They also specify time limits within which information must be provided, the persons to whom the information is to be provided, and the method of providing the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to correct a number of inequities that currently arise in the parliamentary superannuation scheme. The first of the inequities arose in relation to the holding of an office of profit. Currently, where former members hold an office of profit and receive remuneration for their services, I remind honourable senators that their pension is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis up to the maximum reduction. In addition, former members cannot earn any money from holding an office of profit without their pension being reduced. I remind honourable senators that an office of profit extends to agencies and parliaments of states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this bill will do is important. I remind honourable senators that senior bureaucrats leaving the Commonwealth Public Service can take up a posting or a series of postings and receive full remuneration for that particular service that is rendered, without any reduction to their pension entitlement. This bill does not go quite as far as providing a full entitlement, but provides some measure of relief from complete exclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will do three things in relation to the holding of an office of profit. Firstly, it introduces a monetary threshold of office of profit salary before the implementation of any reduction in parliamentary pension. Secondly, it provides for unaffected salaries payable in respect of offices of profit to be increased to the level of the taxed salary that would apply to produce the same net salary as the tax free salary. Thirdly, it abolishes the reduction of parliamentary pension where the beneficiary is receiving a pension arising from an office of profit. The monetary threshold is equivalent to 20 per cent of the parliamentary allowance, before any reduction of pension. Above that threshold, the pension is reduced by 50c for each dollar of income earned from the office of profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that these amendments are being made because it is extremely inequitable that a former parliamentarian who holds an office of profit, even in a state jurisdiction, as opposed to a position in the private sector&mdash;or even compared to the position of a person in the bureaucracy&mdash;should lose so heavily on his pension if he receives any remuneration for his services. It is difficult to think of any other superannuation plan where the obtaining of employment reduces the pension that the super fund must pay. As the provisions existed, there was strong incentive for former members to work only in the private sector after leaving this parliament. I believe they should be encouraged to share the benefit of their wisdom and knowledge gained here for the benefit of both the public and private sectors of the economy. The new threshold ensures that earning a paltry wage from the holding of an office of profit does not affect a member's pension entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where there is currently inequity is in the area of invalidity retirement benefits. Currently, the trust may grant a member invalidity retirement if it is of the opinion that the member's resignation from parliament is bona fide on the grounds of ill-health. There are certain deficiencies here for two reasons: firstly, there are no criteria to follow in deciding invalidity cases; and, secondly, either a member was held to be invalid or failed to be found invalid. One of the difficulties with this criterion was that there was no middle ground. The consequences were very different depending on the trust's decision. There was no arrangement for a graduated access to full invalidity benefit in recognition of special demands of parliamentary service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes amendments to establish procedures to be followed where there is an application for invalidity retirement. It establishes three degrees of invalidity retirement with differing benefits applying to each. It provides a mechanism to review invalidity assessments. The three-tiered system comprising classes A, B and C are based on incapacity in relation to employment outside parliament. I understand there are similar three-tiered invalidity provisions in the defence force superannuation scheme. So we are not creating any special benefits outside those generally enjoyed in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments allow, on their face, only the trust's decision with respect to classifications A and B to be reviewed and not classification as class C. However, I understand that persons classified as class C invalids would be able to have their classification reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area where there was inequity which the bill seeks to address is the recognition of state and territory parliamentary service. The amendment will not allow periods of state or territory service to be recognised in the Commonwealth parliamentary superannuation scheme&mdash;and this is important&mdash;unless the member elects to pay the Commonwealth scheme a share of the transfer value. Again, that is equitable and fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before my time expires I would like to recognise the government's decision to extend the main SIS requirements of preservation, vesting and disclosure to the Commonwealth parliamentary superannuation scheme. At the end of the day, if parliament seeks to impose rules on the community, then parliamentarians should be subject to the same rules. For that reason, I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill 1994 continues the important process of improving the prudential supervision and consumer protection within the superannuation industry and follows on from the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act, which takes effect from next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill follows on from the federal government's commitment that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes will comply with the main operative provisions of the SIS Act, particularly on vesting, preservation and disclosure of information to fund members. Because most Commonwealth schemes are not fully funded, most public sector schemes will be exempted from the investment aspects of the SIS bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill amends the parliamentary superannuation scheme to comply with SIS requirements. The government is in the process of amending its employee schemes to comply with SIS. We strongly support this development and we certainly commend the government on its action in this case. The Australian Democrats believe that workers, whether they be in the public or private sector, should be entitled to protection of their superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is not some gracious concession to be turned on or off like a tap at the whim of an employer. It is a contractual right, part of the contract of employment. Just as there are laws governing the wages to be paid to employees and restricting the right of employers unilaterally to alter wages, so too the new SIS legislation and the former OSSA legislation help to ensure that employers cannot unilaterally alter superannuation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However&mdash;and this is the rub&mdash;a large group of employees has been exempted from the operation of the SIS, and these are the employees of state governments. State governments were exempted from the SIS Act until at least 1 July 1995, on the recommendation of the Select Committee on Superannuation. In its ninth report last month, the committee recommended this exemption following strong joint submissions from the governments of New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. The key finding at page 58 of the report was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee understands that the states are prepared to adopt parallel prudential controls and supervision which are consistent with the SIS standards.</PARA>
<PARA>These are very good sentiments. The committee also had before it a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the premiers, dated 30 September 1993, in which he proposed that the states should be required to automatically comply with the SIS Act unless an exemption was granted. Exemptions would only be granted if the state government undertook to do two things: firstly, guarantee the liabilities of the scheme by ranking the accrued liabilities of the scheme equally with state bonds; and, secondly, ensure compliance with the main operative provisions of the SIS legislation&mdash;vesting, preservation, disclosure and, where applicable, prudent investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is not clear whether this undertaking has been given in full, the joint submission of the four states and the Northern Territory to the Senate committee suggests that most states did agree to comply. The year's grace granted to 1 July 1995 would allow the arrangements to be worked through, and we would support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noteworthy, however, that the Victorian government did not make a submission to the Senate inquiry. In April last year, the Victorian government announced a restructure of its public sector scheme which reduced benefits and entitlements of members. Such action would clearly breach the SIS Act and would also breach the OSSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government claimed that the reduction in benefits was necessary to reduce its unfunded liabilities and the overall level of state debt. As Professor Bob Walker has shown in his analysis of the unfunded superannuation liabilities of the New South Wales government, this argument is spurious. The Senate select committee in its third report recommended a national study of the unfunded liability issues. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth government rejected this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on this untested argument, the Victorian government has engaged in the most blatant breach of Commonwealth superannuation legislation in recent memory. The federal government refused to intervene, resulting in trade unions in the state being forced to negotiate against a loaded gun and accept the Kennett plan. Under the agreement reached in October 1993, the Victorian government allowed the unions the right to test whether the package, in fact, breached the OSSA legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions then turned to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, George Pooley, for a ruling in January. It took Mr Pooley many months to make up his mind. On 2 May, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay in responding is deeply regretted. However, the matters you have raised are so important that I felt it necessary to consult the Treasurer. Unfortunately, the Treasurer is currently very busy with the Budget, which has been brought forward this year by three months. As soon as I have heard from the Treasurer, I will ensure you receive a reply on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Why Mr Pooley, a statutory office holder, should feel the need to consult the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in how to exercise his statutory responsibilities is a serious matter. Here we have a case of a statutory office holder refusing to implement his statute without political direction. Frankly, I believe this is appalling, although, I suppose, after the evidence to the print media inquiry on Mr Pooley's performance in his previous job at the FIRB, we should not have expected anything better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three weeks later, Mr Pooley received his instructions from Mr Willis. He found that the Victorian government had breached federal legislation on three counts: firstly, by a change in the indexation of pensions from six-monthly to an annual basis; secondly, by the change of the salary base for the calculation of pensions from actual annual final salary to average salary during the last two years of employment; and, thirdly, by reducing the notional retirement age for calculation of death and disability benefits from 65 to 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these three measures clearly breached OSSA regulation 17 because they reduced benefits. However, incredibly, Mr Pooley then used his discretion under the act to forgive the second and third debt discretions, arguing that they are `reasonable in the circumstances.' This, in my view, is a gross abuse of his powers under the act. Having found that the fourth largest superannuation scheme in the country has breached the act which he has sworn to uphold, he then forgives it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of Mr Pooley runs counter to the advice of the ISC itself on the interpretation of regulation 17, contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Circular 8</EMPHASIS>. The circular states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of regulation 17 is to ensure the maintenance of members' accrued benefits other than in exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, it removes from the trustees the discretion to reduce members' accrued benefits except with the approval of the members themselves or the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>The circular goes on to suggest that the commissioner should exercise his discretion only where vexatious objections from some members obstruct the reasonable view of the majority. In this case, the members were never consulted. Also, the commissioner has failed to outline the exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire transaction sounds like a deal to me, a deal by the Treasurer to reduce the superannuation entitlements of Victorian public sector workers. Why has he done that? Is it to make Victoria's debt look a bit better and reduce the pressure for a federal government bail out? That is the question. In my view, it is not a sufficient reason to allow a fundamental breach of federal legislation to occur. It is clear that at least one state, Victoria, has not complied with the Prime Minister's letter of September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings into question whether the states should be allowed an exemption from the SIS. It brings into question the way Mr Pooley is exercising his powers as ISC Commissioner. It brings into question whether the Senate superannuation committee was misled when it was advised that the states intended emulating SIS standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first measure in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) that we are debating this morning is the disability wage supplement. This was a 1993 budget initiative, ostensibly designed to assist people with disabilities to enter the work force. As the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) said in the second reading speech, some people with disabilities are unable to find jobs in the open labour market because their disability prevents them from being able to do the job to the level expected of some people without disabilities and, under the existing award wage system, they have to be paid full award wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability wage supplement will be introduced from 1 July 1994 and will provide that disabled persons may be paid less than the award wage based on their productivity compared with a person in the same occupation who does not have such a disability. The disability wage supplement will be available at the same rates applicable to disability support pensioners and will be subject to similar rules, including the income and assets test. As a result, income earned under the supported wage system by a disability wage supplement client will count as income for the purposes of determining a rate of disability wage supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this provision. However, we are concerned that there is a level of confusion and misunderstanding about the supported wage system on the part of peak disability groups, people with disabilities and the businesses which will employ people with disabilities. These measures will create a substantial saving for the government estimated at $4.49 million over three years from savings to the Department of Social Security. The agenda appears to be not so much concerned with the placement of the disabled in the work force but with improvements to be made in the government's budget. It would also appear that it is not much more than a pilot scheme since it affects only about 1,000 people in 1994-95: there are only 1,000 places available. There are plans to increase the 1,000 placements every fiscal year thereafter, but it would appear that the government has not allocated funds in forward estimates. I would therefore question the ability to fund an ongoing program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability sector has raised a number of concerns with the coalition, and I would like to outline a couple of those. Many groups working with the employment of people with disabilities have expressed concern regarding the supported wage system. To begin with, this measure increases the distinction between those with disabilities and other workers, and concerns have been raised that a supported wage system is discriminatory in that people with disabilities are subject to an annual assessment for part payment of an award wage while other employees on a full award wage are not subject to similar productivity assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some anxiety amongst employer groups that those selected for this program will lose their right to self-determination. There is also concern about the need for specific and ongoing training for accredited assessors both within the Commonwealth rehabilitation service and within employment services and the non-government sector. There have also been concerns expressed about the cumbersome and bureaucratic nature of the placing of 1,000 people in supported employment. There will be costs involved with a substantial increase in staff, as well as the cost of employing a team of assessors, some of whom will have to undergo special training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, questions have to be raised regarding the efficiency of the program with the Department of Social Security administering the disability wage supplement and the Department of Human Services and Health administering the accreditation assessment and payments to business. Madam Acting Deputy President, you know that recently we spent some time debating the letting of a contract across three departments. The case involved government, employment and advertising and it was not a very happy experience. There was a lack of coordination between departments in that exercise, so we hope they do better this time when there is a need for coordination between departments in the implementation of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern that has been expressed is that there is no provision to assist employers with regard to the ongoing costs that may be involved. For example, concern has been expressed that there may be ongoing costs&mdash;although the government has made provision for initial outlays&mdash;in terms of insurance. Some have expressed a concern that there may be insurance implications for businesses due to the possibility of higher premiums associated with the employment of people with some form of disability. In the committee hearing we were assured by people from the Department of Social Security, I think it was, that there would not necessarily be ongoing costs, that this had not been demonstrated in America and there was no Australian evidence to suggest this. We hope that the government will keep a close eye on whether businesses experience increased costs in insurance which may inhibit them or reduce their likelihood of employing people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There also seems to be some confusion and misunderstanding, we have been told, regarding the level of disability wage supplement. There is concern that the supported wage system will be marketed as a cheap source of labour for business. Concern has also been expressed about the impact and affect it will have on sheltered workshops. Of course, we have to understand that sometimes there is some difficulty with the more able people in a sheltered workshop going into open employment. We would not want to hinder that at all, but the problem is that if it affects the viability of that workshop, and if this program is not successful&mdash;we hope that it will be, but if it is not successful for some individuals&mdash;there may be a problem as to where these people will be relocated and as to whether there will be a place available for them in the sheltered workshop if the sheltered workshop viability has been threatened. The government ought to watch very closely that the program does not actually backfire and produce a worse situation for those with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the opposition is concerned that people coming off the disability wage supplement automatically qualify for the disability support pension and do not have to make a new claim for the disability support pension, which could take up to eight weeks because of the medical examination requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next measure in this bill involves family payments. As part of the 1993 budget process, the government agreed that from 1 January 1995 the maximum rate of additional family payment payable in respect of children who have not turned 16 should be increased by $1 a week per child. This bill gives effect to that agreement. Approximately 800,000 low income families will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of $45 million in 1994-95 and $46 million in 1995-96. This will not sufficiently compensate low income earners who will suffer the most from Labor's regressive increases in wholesale sales tax announced in the 1993 budget. Nevertheless, it was part of the budget negotiations which will give some, although limited, benefit to those on low income, and we will not be opposing this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the bill provides for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991 to increase the pension age for women from 60 to 65. Currently, women qualify for the age pension at 60, while men qualify at age 65. As announced in the 1993 budget, the increase is to be phased in over a 20-year period starting on 1 July 1995 in recognition of any remaining labour force disadvantages incurred over the years by older women affected by the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1 July 2013 the women's age pension will be payable at 65. We do not oppose this measure. However, we should remind the public of this government's broken promises and hidden agenda at the last election, and it should be placed on the public record. This measure is part of that hidden agenda. The opposition had the intestinal fortitude to be up-front and to tell the Australian public exactly what it planned to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the gumption to tell the public. This government had the measure as part of its had hidden agenda. That is what is so despicable about what is happening in this bill; the government did not tell the public. It is another example of a coalition policy castigated during the 1993 election by the government, only to be adopted by that government within a matter of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the government's statements during the last election regarding lifting the women's pension age to 65. On 7 August 1992 the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition's move to increase the women's pension age to 65 within five years is premature, ill-considered and unfair. Women who have faced greatly restricted opportunities and discrimination during their lives are being offered last minute equality to save the opposition money. It is the sort of two-card trick you would not expect anyone to play on the elderly. It is just one of a huge range of hidden nasties in the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>`Hidden' nasties in the fightback package? We actually told people. This lot on the other side had it so hidden they did not even tell them; it was in their hidden agenda. Dr Blewett went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lower pension age for women is due recognition of the fact that many older women devoted most of their lives to families and sacrificed employment, savings and superannuation in the process. When women of pension age have had similar opportunities to their male counterparts, that will be the time to equalise pension ages, not before.</PARA>
<PARA>Just months after the election the government adopted part of our policy. It extended it over time. A parliamentary committee had recommended that the pension age be increased over a five-year period. But this government does not tell people; it hides what it is going to do. That ought to be a lesson that everybody remembers before the next election. It is not what the government said; it is what the government meant to say&mdash;exactly what Senator Evans said the other day in the chamber: `Read my lips. The tax reductions will be L-A-W.' Then they go off into the never-never. The government does tell you that it is going to increase the pension age for women. That comes afterwards. I will remind people constantly that this government had a hidden agenda and broke promises before the last election. That is the way it operates. The public ought to be reminded of it constantly. This is just another example of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further measure in the bill relates to managed investments. The government's original motive for bringing down measures that penalise self-funded retirees was based on the usual standard slipshod practice of saving a few dollars at the expense of those people who have been able to build a nest egg for themselves. The government struck a blow against a prudent form of self-provision. We are not talking about people with buckets of money; we are talking about a significant proportion of people who have very modest investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two measures in this bill are designed, fortunately, to lessen some of the difficulties experienced by 100,000 Australian pensioners. Both measures are beneficial in that they alleviate some of the very worst effects of the legislation. The first measure imposes a cap of 50 per cent on the rate of return for shares and managed investments for ordinary income assessment purposes and acknowledges that high rates of return cannot be justified in assessing pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure deals with experience arising from the Commonwealth Bank float, where shares were acquired at a price which was considerably higher than the price at which the shares were originally listed. However, the initial list price was the figure used for the 12-month assessment period, resulting in an exaggeration of the true performance of the investment. The amendment will ensure that this will not occur, particularly in cases where there is active trading in shares or units within a short period of time. As Mrs Moylan stated in her speech on this bill in the other place, the Australian Stock Exchange believes that the amendments seem to ameliorate two of the more extreme of the illogical effects of treating unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of the income and assets test. However, it maintains that the whole system remains fundamentally inequitable. That is the stock exchange saying that this system remains fundamentally inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made many statements in this place about the gross inequities inherent in a scheme which counts unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of assessing income for the pension. I have introduced private members' bills and moved amendments to social security legislation to have that repealed. We now have a so-called independent committee investigating it. While that is going on, letters come in my office that are pathetic, and I use that word in its real sense&mdash;letters which are full of pathos. Pensioners, some with $15,000 and some with $20,000 invested, explain to me in absolute detail&mdash;and I have no doubt that senators and members on both sides have received similar letters&mdash;their financial business. They expose it before you to try to make people understand the difficulties they are facing and the enormous cuts that are occurring in pensions as a result of the fluctuations in the stock market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those pensioners are being severely affected. Their small capital base is being eroded. They are finding it distressing. One general practitioner said to me that he has had pensioners coming in who are ill because they have been worrying about what is happening to their pension as a result of the government's treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said innumerable times, many of these older Australians who hold shares are not doing it for speculative gains or to build up large capital to pass onto children. They are doing it to build up a nest egg to enable them to pay their private health insurance&mdash;and heaven forbid, given the state of the public health system, they need private health insurance&mdash;and to protect themselves against unexpected expenses, such as sickness or household maintenance, and in the meantime to receive modest dividend income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A paper gain is an absurd premise on which to base a determination of pensioner entitlements. While the coalition supports the amendments, we continue to strenuously oppose a system that treats unrealised capital gains on shares and investment as income for pension income and assets test purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provision in the bill relates to migration law. The amendment in this respect will help to reduce the lag which occurs between changes to migration law and the Social Security Act. Lag occurs because most changes to the migration law are regulatory, whereas social security amendments are not. These amendments are largely technical in nature and not unreasonable and we do not intend to oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next measure in this bill concerns the refusal on the part of an individual to apply for a tax file number. It results from an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision between the department and Mr John Malloch. Mr Malloch's disability support pension was suspended due to his refusal to provide a tax file number and his refusal to provide authority to request a tax file number from the Australian Taxation Office. The purpose of this amendment is to allow the secretary to the department to refuse assistance payments to individuals who do not have a tax file number or who have no intention of applying for one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a high cost of fraud in the social security area, from within and without. However, the coalition has always had doubts that increasing the use of tax file numbers provides the total answer to fraud control. Critical privacy concerns arise from the extension and compulsion creeping into tax file number system. I have debated that innumerable times in this chamber. This was never the intention, as the then Treasurer Keating made clear in a speech. He said that it was not the intention; whether it was the intention needs to be debated, I suppose. When the tax file was debated in 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments the government has agreed to accept are designed to guarantee that the tax file numbering system is completely voluntary. They ensure that taxpayers will in all circumstances retain the right to elect to have tax withheld at source rather than quote their fax file number. The government has always recognised that this is an important element in the set of privacy safeguards which attach to the tax file number system and these amendments will enshrine the principle in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose we would say `make it L-A-W'. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner has indicated that his preference would have been for the amendment to make clear that the decision as to whether or not an individual provides or applies for a tax file number in full knowledge of the consequences rests with the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had grave concerns about the effectiveness of the tax file number in reducing fraud, especially when the threat to privacy and liberty are taken into account. We know that the savings that the department predicted when the tax file number was introduced to enable data matching between the Taxation Office and the social security department were absolutely, totally out of kilter with and far more than the real and actual savings. We were duped. The difference between the savings that were indicated and the actual savings that occurred was just absolutely outrageous. The coalition does not oppose this provision but we do note, on departmental advice, that the government will be introducing amendments into the Senate, which the coalition will be closely examining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this amendment bill that I want to mention deals with compensation. The coalition supports this provision which is a result of measures which have been endorsed by us. It effectively removes from the definition of compensation the exemption for personal sickness and accident insurance payments where the policy contains an offset clause. The offset clause enables the insurer to be liable to pay the insured person only the amount which would ordinarily be paid under the policy minus the amount of social security payments the person received during the relevant period. This measure is obviously beneficial and the coalition will not oppose it. The other amendments in this bill are minor or technical in nature and we do not intend to oppose any of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. In speaking to this bill today I want to restrict my comments to just three areas. My colleague Senator Meg Lees will be addressing a number of other aspects of the bill. The areas I want to address concern changes proposed to the assets test treatment of allocated pensions, changes to the provision of tax file numbers and the changes imposing new penalty or deferment periods on the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look firstly at allocated pensions. I am a member of the superannuation committee which recently looked at the issue of allocated pensions and their relation to the social security and taxation systems. One of the things our committee picked up on very quickly was that allocated pensions are widely seen by superannuants as an attractive investment option. This is because they are easy to understand and because they offer something of a compromise between lump sums and life annuities. In particular, they can not only provide a regular income stream but also allow for the withdrawal of lump sum payments by commutations, if this is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that while most allocated pensioners used the product to provide a genuine income stream, there is the potential for the system to be abused. This potential arises from the ability to either partially or wholly commute these pensions and to do so an unlimited number of times. Of course, this is one of the features that make these products so attractive to superannuants. It allows them to cover various irregular expenses such as home repairs, car repairs or medical costs. It is also, however, the feature which inspired the Department of Social Security to review its treatment of allocated pensions and to suggest that they more closely resemble managed investments than other superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence from the ACT Council of Social Service highlighted the fact that holders of allocated pensions who also draw an age pension could commute a lump sum of $10,000 in any one fortnight. That $10,000 would exclude them from the age pension for that fortnight by virtue of the income test. But they would then requalify for the age pension in the very next fortnight. While other evidence suggested that the use of this practice was not widespread, Alan Anforth from ACTCOSS submitted, `It doesn't really matter how many are doing it&mdash;if it is undesirable, then it needs to be addressed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question is: just what arrangements do we want to put in place for this product and what sorts of safeguards do we need to ensure that the product is not manipulated in such a way as to effectively double-dip through the social security system? That is a much broader question than one we need to answer here today. It is, however, a question which is within the brief of the pension income and assets test review to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is going to disadvantage about 300 allocated pension holders to the tune of around $300,000 a year. The Democrats believe, and until recently I understand the opposition also believed, that any change which will disadvantage pensioners should be considered within the context of that overall pension income and assets test review. The superannuation committee has identified a number of options in relation to the social security treatment of those pensions. The Democrats believe it is both appropriate and desirable that the income and assets test review should be given the opportunity to build on the work of the committee and to incorporate its ideas into the broader context within which that review is operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this major review is being undertaken&mdash;and it will hand down its findings in less than six months&mdash;I think the government is jumping the gun to be making a piecemeal change like this. The amount of savings to the government from this measure is not large, but the effect on the individual pensioners&mdash;those 300 that I mentioned&mdash;could be enormous. As such, the Democrats oppose this change at this time and we urge the opposition to do the same in order that the income and assets test review can further consider the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that when discussing the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill earlier this year, the shadow minister said that the opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will not agree to any further amendments to social security legislation or veterans' affairs legislation which seek to amend, enhance, develop or modify in any way whatsoever the income and assets testing regime until the independent inquiry . . . has been undertaken, completed and its report presented to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand the opposition changing its position in relation to those parts of the bill before us which are beneficial to pensioners. All I ask is that it sticks to its commitment, as espoused by the shadow minister, and delays this change which will cost allocated pensioners $300,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition continues to support the government on this change, then I want to signal that I will be moving the amendment which has been circulated in my name to exempt all those allocated pension holders who purchased their pension prior to the change in government policy being announced. When people make plans for their income in retirement&mdash;plans that may span 20 or 30 years&mdash;we do not believe the government should just up and change the rules on those people. The Democrats are opposed to retrospectivity, particularly in the area of pensions, and my amendment will remove any retrospective effect of these government amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn now to the amendments contained in the bill which relate to the provision of tax file numbers. The bill seeks to close what the government refers to as a loophole in the tax file number provisions. That so-called loophole was revealed by a hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which ruled that the Department of Social Security did not have the authority to deny a payment to a person who had no tax file number and no intention of getting one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular AAT hearing involved a man from Western Australia, a Mr John Malloch, who was receiving a non-taxable disability support pension, had no need for a tax file number and did not want to get one on ideological grounds. The changes proposed will allow the Department of Social Security to deny a payment to all pensioners and beneficiaries who have no tax file number, regardless of whether that person has any need for a tax file number. The Democrats will not be supporting these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most people in this chamber would know, the Democrats have always been opposed to the extension of the tax file number system into any kind of identification system. Back in 1988, one of our former leaders, Janine Haines, had great foresight when she warned of the potential of the extended tax file number system. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government and the Opposition parties are both to be condemned for their failure to support an alternative system which would have caught people who were cheating the tax system and protected the privacy of Australian taxpayers and would not have laid the foundations for a national identification system.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe the changes the government is proposing here are the final straw in an ever progressing process of transforming the tax file number system into just such a national identification system for all Department of Social Security clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scrutiny of Bills committee clearly recognised this is in its digest No. 6 when it commented that `it appears the tax file number is being used as a method of identification'. This totally contravenes the repeated assurances given to the Democrats and to the people of Australia back in 1988 by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, that the tax file number system would be used solely for taxation purposes. The Australian Democrats do not intend to stand by and watch the further conversion and perversion of our tax file number system into a pseudo-Australia Card. We will be opposing these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make some comment on the government's proposal to increase the penalty deferment periods for unemployed people who breach their activity test. Statistics the minister's office provided to me show that of the 146,000 job search and newstart recipients who breached their obligations only 13,000 committed another breach within three years. In other words, over 90 per cent of those who had that first penalty deferment period of two weeks imposed on them did not breach again. Similarly, of those who were in breach twice, only about 10 per cent breached a third time. In the committee hearing on Friday we might want to see a further breakdown of those figures. Nevertheless, it would seem to me that these initial figures provide very convincing evidence that the current penalty regime is working. Importantly, the low level of double breaches indicates just how onerous a two-week deferment period is on people, let alone the six weeks this bill is seeking to introduce for some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget, however, what we are talking about with these penalty periods. We are talking about people having no income whatsoever for a certain number of weeks. We need to stop and consider very carefully just what we are doing to these people. Under the proposed deferment periods, a long-term unemployed person in breach for a second time would be without any income for 12 weeks. I ask us to consider how we would survive if we had no income for 12 weeks. Of course, the answer to that is that we would use whatever means we had to survive, even if that meant breaking the law, although I certainly would not imply that any honourable senators in this place would break the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember some years ago, when I headed a committee employing a number of young unemployed people in a worker's cooperative, questioning them about this very situation. They had no hesitation in telling me that if they lost their unemployment benefit they would break into a shop. They said to me, `You don't expect us to starve, do you?' I confess that I had no answer to that question. If the only choice we give these people is to steal to survive or to starve, it really is not a choice at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a group of people who on the whole are already feeling very marginalised, if not totally alienated from society. These people, just like the rest of us, have to eat, have to pay rent and meet other expenses. I simply cannot bring myself to support these changes and I am not sure I can understand how anyone else could, particularly when the evidence is that the current penalty system is working. These penalties need to be an avenue of last resort. The low level of double breaches indicates just how onerous a penalty of two weeks is, yet we are now talking about trebling that penalty. I urge all honourable senators to think these changes through. If they do that, I am sure they will come to the conclusion that the changes need to be opposed. </PARA>

However, I am assured that the amendments will be introduced during the committee stage when the legislation goes off to a particular committee to examine other aspects of it. In one sense, that is unfortunate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which I chair, has played a significant role in bringing to the government's attention the importance of allocated pensions in retirement income plans of Australian retirees. Following the government's security in retirement statement, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) announced changes to the treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities under the social security income and assets test. These amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) were enacted last year but their commencement was deferred to the later of 1 October 1993 or the date of the superannuation committee's report on the application of division 19 of that act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the timing of the distribution of these amendments that are given to the committee is appalling. To continue the backgrounding, the committee felt that the merits and drawbacks of allocated pensions should be fully reviewed, given their high prevalence. The committee conducted an extensive review. It received 37 submissions to its original inquiry and 20 submissions to the options paper inquiry and a number of public hearings were held. The committee presented to the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, its preliminary report in March this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee resolved to prepare a preliminary options paper rather than turn the issue into a political football and trigger the commencement of the legislation. The committee identified from early deliberations that there were considerable pitfalls in treating allocated pensions as managed investments for social security purposes. Whilst the committee gave strong support to measures to remove alleged rorts, it identified some positive aspects of the allocated pension regime that, with appropriate modification, would further the integration of private and public retirement income and discourage the dissipation of lump sums. The committee found that allocated pensions were seen as an attractive product between lump sums and annuities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearings it became clear to the committee that the most popular features of the allocated pensions were flexibility, simplicity, regularity of income payments and the provision of a group certificate. The Minister for Social Security replied to the options paper and advised that, having examined the issues, the current income test treatment of allocated pensions would continue and that in the meantime allocated pensions would be included in the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution of this issue through the Senate committee system has proven a most desirable outcome and is testimony to the positive contribution the committee process makes to parliamentary debate. These amendments seek to implement that decision by repealing the current provisions of the Social Security Act and providing for allocated pensions to be included as assessable assets for the purpose of the assets test, with effect from 1 July 1994. The committee is pleased to see that retirees will not be subject to rolling changes to the rules surrounding their retirement income. I am pleased not only that the minister responded positively to the options paper but also that his response has been speedy. There are many retirees who have found the uncertainty surrounding allocated pensions very worrying. That has now come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank me colleagues Senator Sue West, Senator Bruce Childs, Senator Chris Evans, Senator Ferguson and Senator John Woodley for their contributions and their forbearance. I would also like to thank the staff of the Senate select committee for their hard work and their thorough examination of the issues. I believe that this has contributed to a satisfactory outcome to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Now that the amendments have been rushed in front of me, I believe that we will be limiting the debate at the second reading stage. I indicate that I will be seeking to continue my remarks on allocated pensions during the committee stage in this chamber, perhaps next week. The opposition wishes to assure people that we are concerned to ensure that the rights of existing allocated pension holders are not diminished as a result of the issues that have just been put before us, otherwise it will tend to minimise the very objectives the committee sought to overcome. I thank the Senate and await the hearings of the committee, which is examining only certain aspects of this bill. I look forward to further debate during the committee stage on the issue of allocated pensions particularly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking today on only two aspects of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)&mdash;the increase in the women's pension age from 60 to 65 years and the new disability wage supplement. My colleague Senator Woodley has dealt with other aspects of this bill. With regard to women's pension age, when this was first mooted&mdash;and that goes back to the Fightback documents&mdash;the Democrats have been opposed to raising from 60 to 65 years the age when women become eligible for the pension. Indeed, from the moment it was announced in the 1993-94 federal budget we have actively opposed this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the government, which was highly critical of this when it came out in the Fightback document, we do not have to twist ourselves inside out to try to justify any policy backflip. We can stand here without any embarrassment whatsoever and say that we and we alone have opposed this since it was Liberal-National policy and certainly now that it has suddenly become government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill raises the pension age for women from 60 to 65 years over the next 18 years by increasing the women's pension age by six months every two years. For example, women who are currently aged 57 who could have had access to the age pension at 60 will now have to wait an additional six months. A woman who is currently 51 will have to wait until she is 63. A woman currently 47 will now have to wait until she is 65, and women who are 45 years or younger will have to wait until they turn 65 to get access to a pension. I stress here that women who are now 60 will not be affected by this legislation, and of course there is no change to the men's pension age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats see this as simply a cost saving measure&mdash;nothing else. We would like to see it postponed but we would prefer to see it dropped altogether. We are strongly of the view that the pension age for women should not be raised until women of pension age have had similar employment, savings and superannuation opportunities as men of pension age. All the available evidence shows that we are still a long way from reaching that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time recently Senator Kernot, Senator Knowles and I asked Senator Crowley about the trends in equal pay for women. We were all concerned about the recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which showed that in the year ending February 1994 average male earnings increased by 2.3 per cent while average female earnings increased by only 1.8 per cent. In response we got a very vague and quite strange answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government began madly hunting through figures to try to justify its argument. It basically said that we should go back and look at trends. I am quite happy to look at trends, but not when they are as transparently tailored and as selective as the figures that the government eventually came up with. The government went back through about the last 10 years of figures, picked a small time frame that suited its own ends and then argued on what happened over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What if we select a different time frame? What if I choose to go back to 1983 and track through to February 1994? Those figures paint a rather different picture. They show that women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings declined quite dramatically from December 1983 to September 1986, picked up again to September 1987, declined to September 1989, peaked in December 1991 and have been declining ever since, to the point where in February 1994 they were almost back to where we started from in 1983. In other words, over the last 10 years women have made virtually no progress whatsoever towards equal pay with men. In the last year, as those recent ABS statistics show, that trend has accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not very reassuring trends. They certainly do not justify the government's optimism that women will achieve pay equality with men suddenly in the next 18 years. What will the government do if these recent trends continue? In two years time, will it turn around and decide that, as women have fallen even further behind, it will reverse its decision on increasing the pensionable age for women? Unfortunately, I think it is most unlikely that it will act, despite the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of how the government wants to twist statistics to suit its own ends, it is pretty clear that women are a long way from catching up with men in terms of equal pay. That does not just mean less money in women's pockets on a week by week basis. It means less earning capacity over an extended period of time; it means reduced ability to accumulate superannuation; and it means less capacity to accumulate assets and savings for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women over 40, in particular, have lived with these inequalities all their working lives. They have worked without equal pay for 10 or 20&mdash;and in some cases 25&mdash;years. They have had fewer opportunities for career advancement or promotion than have men in the same age bracket. They have not had the same capacity as men to accumulate superannuation and savings. The average woman in this age group has taken several years off work to raise children, putting herself at a disadvantage in terms of career, earning potential and superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While women's access to superannuation is clearly improving, the fact remains that the vast majority of women still have only been in superannuation schemes for the last five or six years. For women over 40, all these factors translate into significantly reduced payouts on retirement. For example, at present, while 22.4 per cent of men receive a super payout in excess of $80,000, only 3.6 per cent of women get payouts of that size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of last year, the Women's Policy Unit of the Office of the Cabinet in Queensland produced a discussion paper on women and superannuation. The unit found that the majority of female employees do not have work patterns which fit comfortably with existing super structures and, as a consequence, most women cannot rely upon superannuation to support them in retirement. The paper pointed out that, while most women in the paid work force were now in superannuation schemes, those schemes still did not reflect the needs of their women members who earned less than the average weekly wage paid to men and who because of the casual or part-time nature of their work were more likely to change industries or occupations. The paper concluded that entitlements from superannuation were not viable as a retirement income or investment option for the majority of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also many women who work for low or no wages in small businesses, on family farms or in backyard sweatshops as outworkers. These women will probably never have access to any sort of superannuation. In short, irrespective of what cloud the government is currently living on, the fact is that professional women in well-paid jobs with good access to superannuation are in a very small minority in this country. They will not be the ones struggling to find work in their 60s because&mdash;and the government knows this&mdash;most of the women initially affected by this measure will be those on low incomes who will find it very difficult to continue working. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to draw attention to the government's failure to stick to its own stated aims in terms of the deficit. Last year we heard a lot of rhetoric about the government being committed to a deficit reduction strategy. I remind the Senate that the government is moving away from those undertakings very strongly, particularly in relation to last year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that in the current year the government is about to spend over $13 billion more than it collects in revenue. The recent budget estimates for 1994-95 have predicted that it will again enter the same sort of fiscal irresponsibility for the coming year to the extent of another $11.7 billion. The figure for the coming year depends also on the government being able to sell off assets to the value of $2.45 billion&mdash;something which itself will be dependent on the suitability of market conditions and profit expectations for assets; for example, Qantas. I do not need to remind the Senate what is happening in terms of the slides on the share market at present. Therefore, the ability of the government to achieve its predicted $2.45 billion assets sales target is very conditional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government has thought through a number of its proposals in its last budget. This morning I gave notice of a motion in which I reminded the Senate of a problem that the government could find in the share ownership plan, which is going to disenfranchise large sections of the work force. Yesterday I also reminded the Senate that under the Qantas so-called employee share plan there could be a fringe benefits tax liability in excess of $20 million, which would have to be taken into account in assessing the final price and which would be a further reduction on the government's expectation of the sale proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I need to remind the Senate of a few undertakings given by the government. On page 41 of One Nation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that the Australian Commonwealth budget deficit would be&mdash;and for fiscal responsibility would need to be&mdash;less than $1 billion in 1994-95 and that for 1995-96 there would be a surplus of $2 billion. By his own definition, therefore, the Prime Minister has just overseen the presentation of a fiscally irresponsible budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's election hysteria before last year's federal election led to the death of fiscal responsibility at the hands of political cynicism. The government revised its plan so that a deficit of about $5.5 billion was forecast for 1996-97. This remains the official target. But on the history of recent years it would be no surprise if the government forgot its responsibilities yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for observers to say that Mr Keating's forecast went astray because his growth predictions did not materialise. However, this explanation is really not so elementary. One Nation anticipated 4.75 per cent and 4.5 per cent real growth in 1992-93 and 1993-94. The outcome was far less&mdash;2.9 per cent and four per cent, respectively. These variations from the anticipated growth figures cannot explain the vast differences which occurred in the actual budget deficit results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also broken its promises on the second round of tax cuts announced in One Nation, with the tax cuts planned for 1 January 1996 now suspended completely despite the undertakings at the election that they were `l-a-w&mdash;read my lips'. This should normally make the lower deficit targets easier to achieve but, again, recent accomplishments give us no confidence that this will eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the financial markets are suddenly becoming jittery as they see the full implications of the 1992 targets being so blatantly ignored. The latest prediction is a deficit of $11.7 billion in 1994-95&mdash;nearly $8 billion more than the One Nation predictions. The budget predicts a deficit for 1995-96 of $9.8 billion&mdash;some $12 billion over the One Nation goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating was so forthright in stating in 1992 that fiscal responsibility required nothing short of a $2 billion surplus for 1995-96, where have all his standards gone? In any other field of economic life in this country, a managing director who failed so badly to achieve his own standards of discipline would have been removed by one of his colleagues. No wonder the Prime Minister prefers to keep political debate at the level of flags and other extraneous issues&mdash;issues which my colleagues will continue to address in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday in this chamber I moved a notice of motion to congratulate the churches in their formation of a new body to be called the National Council of Churches in Australia.

Today it is worthwhile congratulating the churches on their coming together in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is very appropriate that the national parliament should acknowledge the formation in the national capital of this particular body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reading some of the material which has been circulated on this issue, I agree with the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In Unity</EMPHASIS> magazine that the inauguration, we trust, will take place in the context of the praise of God and that our new National Council of Churches will come into being to fulfil the hopes and dreams of the many people who have worked together to enable this event to take place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to a number of people who I know have been active in the journey which has brought the churches to this point. I pay tribute to Jean Skuse, the General Secretary of the Australian Council of Churches from 1976 to 1988. She is a woman of great talent and prophetic ability who often stood alone in some of the causes she took up, yet history and time have proven that in all of those stances she was not only prophetic but also correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the information which has been circulated to underline this particular celebration there are some of Jean Skuse's reflections, and I would like to read a couple of her comments into the record. As general secretary of the ACC she saw that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A characteristic of the seventies and early eighties was the rise of peoples' movements around the globe&mdash;civil rights, black power, feminism, the shift in the development debate from charity to justice, and various other liberation movements. All were confronting the existing models of power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge for the churches at that time was the inseparability of the unity of the church from the unity of humankind. While churches and councils around the world were struggling to find the right formulae for agreed statements people were meeting in informal ecumenical networks for prayer and social action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution of the laity has always been important for ecumenical renewal and one only needs to compare old and recent photographs to see how the face of ecumenism has changed over the years to be more representative of those who are the Church.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Jean Skuse herself was a lay woman and that underlines her contribution. I would indicate that this new body will represent 85 per cent of Christians in Australia, and if discussions with the Lutheran church bear fruit this week the body will represent 87 per cent of Christians in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Bishop Bede Heather from the Roman Catholic church and Bishop Richard Appleby from the Anglican church, co-conveners of the working group, on bringing about this historic coming together of the churches. In 1988 the Australian Council of Churches at its general meeting invited non-members of that body to dream, to think and to pray. The result of all that work is the unique balance of very large groupings of churches&mdash;Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant&mdash;within this new body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we come in this place today to acknowledge the symbol of hope and reconciliation which the coming together of these people and these churches symbolise.

Does that mean that 60 per cent of Australians cannot determine what is Australian or that the 20 per cent minority is somehow an elite that is to advise the majority what the flag ought to be? If 60 per cent of Australians identify with the flag, it is clearly a symbol of national unity and a symbol which is Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's real concern is that there is a small Union Jack in the top left-hand corner. That is the real reason for its objection. But the Union Jack, which is only a small part of our flag, is a very great part of our heritage and foundation as a modern nation. It would be akin to the Prime Minister telling his parents on his 18th birthday, `I'll change my name because I've grown up and I need to make my own way in the world.' He did not do that. Undoubtedly, the reason for that was that he was proud of his parental heritage, name and origin. Why should not Australia similarly keep that small symbol on its flag that represents Australia's heritage and origin? There is no logical argument for change or support among the general population for a change, yet Labor desperately pursues its goal of destroying the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the national anthem. The lesson to be learned from that is a very interesting one. We changed our national anthem with less than 50 per cent support. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Affair</EMPHASIS> received 43.2 per cent support in a poll some 10 to 15 years ago. It became our national anthem in 1984 by official proclamation of His Excellency the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen. Now, only 10 years later, we have prominent public figures, prominent well-respected Australians such as Allan Border, Geoff Blainey, even Joan Kirner and Peter Hollingworth, expressing their dissatisfaction. The change in the late 1970s and early 1980s concerning our anthem caused great controversy at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply ask the question: ten years later, where are we? We are still confused and dissatisfied with our anthem. Surely we as a nation need to be more mature in determining our national symbols. Surely we will not change our anthem every decade. The anthem exercise clearly warns us: move in haste, repent at leisure. Similarly with our flag, change for the sake of some unexplained desire for change is not sufficient reason and will result only in Australians rejecting and feeling indifferent to those symbols that ought to be above politics and a unifying force and focus of bipartisan attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to our constitution. Our constitution and system of government have withstood the test of time. Indeed, it was most ironic that the Prime Minister of Australia told the French President in France that he had this desire for a republic. In speaking to Francois Mitterrand, the Prime Minister was speaking to the President of the fifth republic of France. The French have had four attempts and failed; they are now on their fifth. Compare that system of government with the British monarchy and the Westminster system and our own home-grown and developed constitution, which is a unique and dynamic federal system of government. The stability of those two systems is the envy of the world, yet the Prime Minister dishonestly seeks to undermine the great document. Allow me to quote what he said in recent times:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Learning about the Constitution apprises people of the fact that we've got a Constitution which was designed by the British Foreign Office to look over the Australian Government's shoulder.</PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly false. That comment by the Prime Minister indicates that the wheels are falling off the republican bandwagon and therefore the Prime Minister needs to resort to greater and greater distortions to try to get his message across. It also indicates clearly that the Labor government will stop at nothing. Those opposite have no moral code by which they conduct themselves in public debate. If they want to get a point across, they will use any technique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Prime Minister's statement, it is wrong, wrong, wrong. Let me point that out. First, the Australian constitution was framed by Australians for Australians and on Australian initiative. The document was drafted by Samuel Griffith, who had lived in Australia since the age of nine, along with Kingston, Clark and Edmund Barton, who were all native born Australians. Does the Prime Minister think that somehow these native born Australians were less Australian than he is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on. The British Colonial Office played no essential part in framing the Commonwealth constitution, and the Foreign Office, to which the Prime Minister referred, had nothing whatsoever to do with the matter. That is not a matter of opinion; that is a matter of historical fact. So we have a Prime Minister who either deliberately lied or is completely and utterly ignorant as to the constitutional history of our great country. Ultimately, the constitution was adopted because Australians voted for it by a plebiscite, by a referendum. When suggestions were made that the Australian constitution ought to be altered to allow the interpretation of the constitution to be determined in London, it was argued in Australia, and successfully so, that the Australian High Court ought to have the final determination in that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very glad that I have had the opportunity today to try to set the record straight in relation to the Prime Minister's distortion. Labor supporters around this country must be absolutely embarrassed by the performance of their Prime Minister. The real tragedy is that, while the Prime Minister fiddles with the flag and constitution, our nation is being undermined by the Prime Minister's `moth to a candle' obsession with international treaties. As he flies closer and closer to the wonderfully bright light of the candle, he does not recognise that behind the bright light is an all-consuming flame which will devour our nation's sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times my home state of Tasmania has witnessed debates on the involvement of the United Nations in our domestic law. Firstly, we had the Toonen submission, which contained lies and falsehoods yet was embraced by the United Nations as the truth. Tasmania was denied the right to defend itself and to test the accuracy of Mr Toonen's evidence. The United Nations Human Rights Committee seeks to tell the people of Tasmania that its democratically elected government, chosen by the people of Tasmania for the people, ought to change its laws. At the same time, the committee breaches every basic rule of natural justice, such as the right to cross-examine your accuser, the right to a fair hearing, the right to an open and public hearing, the right to have an unbiased tribunal determine the matter&mdash;the list goes on. The United Nations is a laughing stock, with its pathetic attempt to tell peace-loving nations like Australia and the state of Tasmania how to conduct themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in recent times Tasmania has had a blast from the past from the former Labor leader in Tasmania, Mr Wriedt, peddling flower power theories on child discipline and threatening to go to the United Nations. No wonder Mr Wriedt never became the Premier of my state. He was willing to give away the rights of Tasmanian families, teachers and schools to administer loving discipline to an unrepresentative body in Geneva. My wife and I want to make decisions about discipline of our children for ourselves, not have those decisions made by bureaucrats sitting in Geneva, on the other side of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal law and discipline of the child are just two examples of areas where international conventions impinge on Australia's sovereignty. Also affected are the areas of industrial relations and environmental law. These matters are now all being dictated out of Geneva. I am very proud to be a member of the parliamentary Liberal Party, which has as its leader Mr Alexander Downer, who so publicly opposed the abuse of these international treaties as being some credible form of domestic law making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further cornerstone of our great nation is its democratically elected parliament. Yet even this is being undermined by the Labor government by its outrageous use of the guillotine. The facts speak for themselves. The current Labor government has avoided the scrutiny of bills passing through parliament by a technique known as the guillotine. The guillotine was originally used to enable legislation to be considered quickly in emergency situations. To do this, a time limit was placed on debate. This procedure is now being used to the level of abuse by the Keating Labor government. Mr Keating has guillotined 257 bills in his first 2 1/2 parliamentary years as Prime Minister. During the 11 years of federal Labor government from 1983 to June 1994, 666 pieces of legislation were guillotined. In comparison, there were only 218 bills guillotined for the entire period between 1901 to 1982. This Labor government's total represents more than three times that number in one-seventh of the time. Australia needs a desperate and urgent change of government to unify our nation once again behind the institutions and symbols that ought to be beyond politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interesting thing about the article is that one finds that Dr Andrew Theophanous, the chairman of the Australia-Germany parliamentary group, has invited representatives of German organisations, firms and federations to a think-tank on the future in Melbourne. The disturbing thing is that it appears that Dr Theophanous has done this in his position as chairman of the Australia-Germany parliamentary group. For the record, I checked with the Parliamentary Relations Office, and the Australia-Germany parliamentary group last met on 11 March. That meeting was to elect the officers of the body. Since then, there have been no meetings, and there have certainly been no meetings at which this matter has been discussed. I am very disturbed because I am a member of that group and, until last year, I was the secretary of the group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things Dr Theophanous tells the German community in this country that he seeks to address are issues such as the difficulty in obtaining recognition of school leaving certificates or professional qualifications and questions relating to superannuation and social security. Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that these matters, important though they are, are not the normal province of a parliamentary group. The normal role of a parliamentary group is to manage relations between the Australian parliament and the parliament of the relevant country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Theophanous is abusing his position as chairman of this parliamentary group for his own political advantage and for the political advantage of the Australian Labor Party. To do that destroys the very basis on which this parliamentary group is formed&mdash;a basis of bipartisanship. It is the most despicable, demeaning act that he could possibly do as chairman of the group. I am very disturbed that he should take this course of action without any consideration of the interests of other members of the group. There have been no meetings to discuss the matter, none of the other members of the group have been advised of it and, until I first read about this in May, nobody new anything about it at all. More importantly, as this bipartisan group has members from just about every party in this parliament, it is disturbing that he seeks to convene these meetings in the name of the parliamentary group without inviting any other member of the group to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I feel very strongly that there is only one course of action Dr Theophanous can now take in good faith, that is, to resign as chairman of the parliamentary group. He has grossly abused the position. He has put the bipartisan nature of the group at risk and he has done absolutely nothing to foster the interests of parliamentary relations. In fact, by politicising this group he runs the risk of destabilising the good relations we have. Obviously, if members of the opposition who are members of the group feel that this matter is being used to political advantage for one side of the parliament, there is the very real risk that many of us will withdraw from the group, and that will only be to the detriment of the goals and objectives of good relations between Australia and Germany. I do not think Dr Theophanous has any other course of action. He can do whatever he wants in his own name, but as the chairman of the Australia-Germany parliamentary group he has absolutely no right to behave in this way. I put him on notice. I think the best thing he can do is resign or cancel the meeting. </PARA>

It was passed to give statutory recognition to the present flag in preparation for the royal tour of that year. The schedule to the act is clear about the nature and origins of the flag.

This allowed the new nation a free choice of design and, ultimately, reflected the popular will. But the truth is actually quite different. The first condition of the competition was that the flag `be based on the British ensign'. So the competition's terms of reference were quite clear: it had to be based on the British ensign, which is what we would expect in 1901, but surely it is not what we would expect of multicultural Australia by the year 2001. </PARA>

Australia's choice was not over which flag to adopt. It was more a matter of deciding which local symbols should `deface the red and blue ensigns', the dominant background colours of the alternative flags. Even then there was no unequivocal decision in favour of the blue ensign. When introducing the Flags Bill in 1953, Senator George McLeay explained:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not tearing up anything; I am simply setting out the facts relating to the Flags Act. Time has passed since 1901. Some of us have noticed that and some of us have not. Time has moved on and flags have changed in sympathy all over the world. Almost all the countries which once had colonial flags have replaced them, appreciating that they could not symbolise the ideals and aspirations of independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even here in Australia, the Northern Territory has abandoned the symbol of the old empire and of British government. The Northern Territory flag is a wonderful flag  and a wonderful symbol for that territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, there are 47 ex-British colonies which now have distinctive national flags. That leaves Australia, New Zealand and Fiji as the only ex-colonies to retain the flag of the empire. Our embarrassment is compounded by the fact that few remaining British colonies still fly the Blue Ensign. So as far as flags are concerned, Australia lines up with the Virgin Islands, St Helena, Pitcairn Island, the Falklands and the British Antarctic Territory&mdash;strange company for an independent nation. We can scarcely claim that people outside Australia do not understand our point of view. </PARA>

We must involve people in the debate and get the facts on the public record. The debate cannot be allowed to degenerate into name calling and accusations about tearing up the flag. We are all loyal to the flag we have at the moment but many Australians say&mdash;and I agree with them&mdash;that we need to look to the flag of the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I was not planning to speak in this debate but I heard the remarks that Senator Reynolds made and thought I should join in. I have a few points to make which might help her understanding the issues involved in changing our national flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate illustrates that this is a very emotional and divisive issue. In many ways symbols are hard to debate. They are not corporate logos. You cannot sit down with a group of artists and designers and say that you are going to have a new national symbol. It is not simply a matter of coming up with a nice new colourful design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of a nation's history national symbols are invested with a lot of emotion. People feel strongly about the flag, and not for reasons of any intrinsic beauty. I note that when Senator Reynolds referred to the flag debate of 1953 she did not mention the contributions of Dr Evatt and Arthur Calwell who both spoke very strongly and warmly about our flag. That is part of Labor Party history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National symbols are invested with a lot of emotion. When most of us look at the Australian flag we see just that&mdash;the flag of Australia, a flag that has flown over this country since 1901. I believe that it flew for the first time in September 1901 over the Exhibition building in Melbourne. It was not officially proclaimed until 1903 but the design was flown as early as 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national flag is not a corporate logo. If we have a new flag in the year 2000 what is to prevent us in the year 2020 saying that that flag represents a previous period in our history and that we need another national symbol? Perhaps we will end up as a country divided by flags. That would be a very sad thing indeed because a national flag must be a symbol of national unity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is clear that most people in this country are very comfortable with and proud of the Australian flag. I was speaking to a Labor Party voter this morning. He came up to me, patted me on the back&mdash;</PARA>

He was concerned about the Labor Party's attitude to this issue, because the flag is as much the flag of the Labor Party as it is the flag of the Liberal Party. For the last 20 years both parties have featured the flag on their logos&mdash;that is until recently. The two areas of great political conflict in the nation at this time are now symbolised in the logos of those two parties.

I can tell Senator Reynolds what has happened: a bloke called Paul Keating. The Prime Minister does not like our flag. He hates our flag&mdash;we all know that. He hates the constitution.

But there is a great irony of history, because the Labor Party under Keating does not look to London to draw its inspiration. It looks to Geneva. It has decided to involve the United Nations in our domestic activities. The Labor Party may sneer at the Australians of yesteryear&mdash;and, of course, they are fair game; they cannot stand up and defend themselves&mdash;but I wonder what the Australians of yesteryear would think of a party that says, `We can't make these laws in our own country.

We do not have the British Colonial Office coming over here giving us instructions. That died 50, 60 or 70 years ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was an interesting reference to the Labor Party in Senator Reynolds's speech. As I said, the Labor Party of old, and the leaders of the Labor Party of old, were as proud of this country as anybody on this side of the chamber. The Labor Party of old was a great booster of the flag. The way we go about the rewriting of history is interesting. In the flag debate that Senator Reynolds referred to, Dr Evatt made a very interesting statement. I do not know whether Senator Reynolds can recall that, but he said that the Australian flag, as far as the Labor Party was concerned and as far as he was concerned, was the most beautiful flag in the world. Has not the Labor Party come a long way!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was an interesting comment by Arthur Calwell, another Labor Party leader. There was an unpleasant exchange in the chamber because he said, `The blue in the flag is not the blue of the sky over this nation. It is the blue of the Eureka flag.' One of my colleagues said an unkind word. He probably was not a supporter of small business people like we are; we are strong supporters of the Eureka flag. He said, `What rot!' And Arthur Calwell said, `Whether you like it or not, the Eureka flag is embodied in our national flag.' The blue that he saw was the blue of the Eureka flag. So I say to Senator Reynolds: these things are not corporate logos. These things are invested with the history of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators of the French with their tricolour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Campbell. Mr Keating did not say that. This will come as a shock to Senator Burns, so he should remain seated, but in that proud French flag, the white stands for the monarchy. France is a country with a bit of national pride. It does not have the Harold Scrubys and the Paul Keatings going around saying, `Oh, shucks, this French flag has been around for 200 years and, boy, we have got to change it because the French nation has changed.' The French do not go on like that. They understand a great truth which those opposite, Mr Keating and those few members of the Labor Party who have joined this bandwagon do not understand; that is, that a country's flag is invested with the history of that country and is the symbol of its history. That is why it creates the extremely high emotion it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators opposite might have been shocked when Mr Keating said that Australians never fought under the flag. Well, I do not know where Mr Keating draws his history from. Maybe its from Don Watson. If Don Watson is feeding Mr Keating his lines, I guess Don Watson had better look more closely at his history books. In the First World War there was a great battle on 8 August 1918. The Australian troops burst through the German lines and Ludendorff called it `the black day in the history of the German army'. As the Australians troops advanced forward on that great day, this is what came in from the front line to General Monash and what General Monash then cabled the Governor-General:</PARA>

I think the debate that has occurred in this chamber during the lunch period and the debate that is happening out there in our community proves yet again that we are a lucky country. The fact that we can have open and free debate about the symbols of this nation is something that we should be proud of. I think the debate that is going on at the moment is a very healthy debate. It is part of the maturing of this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been debate all through this week and during last week about the constitution being developed by Australians for Australia. I have some difficulty with that. I think the founding fathers, as they are known, certainly did a wonderful job at the time, but I do not know whether they were really Australians. Technically, under our laws we did not have such things as Australian citizens until 1949, after the passage of the Australian Nationality and Citizenship Bill 1948. That is a problem with history. I do not have a problem with them being described as the founding fathers of Australia, but until 1949 all the then Australian citizens were actually British subjects rather than Australians. How could the founding fathers have been Australians in the 1880s and the 1890s when, at that time, we were not a nation, we were a collection of colonies?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments have been made many times about the Australian flag. I think it is quite an attractive emblem for any nation to have. Unfortunately, it is somewhat confusing to people. I recall that last November when I was in Cambodia, one of my parliamentary colleagues mistook the New Zealand flag for the Australian flag. He asked why the Australian flag was hanging over a particular establishment in the Siem Reap province in Cambodia. I will not name him&mdash;that would be unfair as the individual is not in this chamber at the moment&mdash;but honourable senators would not have to search too far to find out who it is. The Australian flag is confusing for some people. It is not dissimilar to the New Zealand flag. There are distinctions when the two are held together and people who are well versed in emblems of nations would be able to distinguish the Australian flag from other flags carrying the Union Jack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now growing up. This nation was settled by white people just over 200 years ago. Many changes have taken place in this chamber since the settlement of white people. In recent times changes have continued. I mentioned earlier that we passed the Australian Citizenship Act in 1948. In 1953 I think we first formally and adopted the flag as the official emblem of this country. We adopted the current flag, and there has been a minor change to it since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly attractive flag that I would have liked to have seen as the emblem of the nation unfortunately has been discredited. A few moments ago Senator Kemp mentioned the Eureka flag. That holds a particular, significant place in Australian history. On Monday I received some literature, as we all do from our constituents and constituent groups. One of the constituent groups which I am no friend of, the Australian Nationalist Movement&mdash;a racist organisation&mdash;has now adopted that wonderful emblem to pass across its message of hatred in this country. Unfortunately, because of actions like that, the Eureka flag cannot be considered as the emblem of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very healthy debate in our society. It is a debate that I certainly welcome. For the most part, it is a very mature debate. I believe it will end with Australia deciding to become a republic, and end being a constitutional monarchy. With that, I think we will adopt a new emblem. We might adopt a new national anthem, although I think that is further down the list of priorities. Whilst all that is happening, the Australian constitution has to be looked at. The document which has served this country very well for over 90 years, and which can still serve us well into the 21st century and future centuries, needs to be updated. In many places it is very antiquated&mdash;relevant to the 1880s, 1890s and 1900s&mdash;and many parts of it are not relevant to the 21st century, which this country is about to enter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever new way in which the question is put, there is no more virtue in this issue being raised today by the opposition than there has been all week. It is an attempt to beat up a story which has quite enough life of its own and does not need any help from the opposition. Of course it is the case that both the government and the Reserve Bank continue to monitor developments in both the domestic economy and the world bond market and of course it is the case that they will continue to take both sets of developments into account in setting monetary policy. Of course, moreover, it is also the case that the government will continue to set monetary policy in a way that is designed to ensure both low inflation and low inflationary expectations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the domestic economy is concerned, the position remains exactly as I have stated all week and there is absolutely nothing more to add as to the substance of it&mdash;namely, that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are absolutely sound and, in particular, there is no sign whatsoever of any pick-up in inflationary pressures in the Australian economy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief economist of Bankers Trust, Dr Chris Caton, was very widely quoted this morning&mdash;and so he should have been&mdash;as saying that there was no logic in bond rates being any higher now than they were a year ago. If there is any skittishness in the Australian bond market at the moment, it is obviously as a result of developments elsewhere&mdash;developments not in Australia but in the world at large and world inflationary expectations, not ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly no ground to suggest, as some opposition spokesmen and commentators have been saying, with no sense at all, that these developments are the result of a failure of fiscal responsibility by the government in this year's budget. The government's deficit reduction strategy is universally regarded as absolutely responsible; indeed, one of the tightest in the OECD. Our deficit will be coming in at less than one per cent of GDP while the figure for the United States will be 2.3 per cent, Canada three per cent, France 2 1/2 per cent, and the UK around two per cent. On top of that, Australia has one of the lowest ratios of outlays to GDP in the OECD.</PARA>

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac survey is good economic news for Australia.

But this is good news for the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey shows that the expectation in industry is for continued and strong economic growth in the economy. The survey finds that on all the indicators for the manufacturing sector&mdash;the levels of orders on the books, the increase in employment in this sector, the increase in output by this sector and the export orders undertaken by this sector&mdash;expectations and performance are up, and that all expect a rise in the June quarter of this year. The survey also shows, on quarter by quarter comparisons, that the growth in the June quarter compared to the March quarter is a little under the levels of the March quarter, but it is expected that the September quarter will rebound strongly again and will do as well as, if not better than, the growth percentages in the March quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business confidence, as an indicator, is high; 61 per cent of the respondents to this survey of Australian business expect that conditions in the economy will continue to improve. The price pressures as uncovered by the survey are found not to be strong. This survey, over the last five quarters that it has been conducted, has shown an expectation by Australian business that there will be a price surge of some sort. None of those expectations have been realised over the last five quarters. The expectation here is that there will be some mild uptake in prices but, importantly, overall there will be significantly no pressure on prices compared to the levels of pressure on prices in the early 1990s and late 1980s. In other words, the expectation of this survey by the Australian manufacturing sector is that there will be very low inflation in the economy and that that will remain as a permanent feature of the economy. One thinks that that is in consort with what all of the other prognosticators of economic forecasting say about the future of the Australian economy.</PARA>

His visa was issued, as Senator Evans said yesterday, in New Delhi after all requirements had been assessed as met. In the case of the onshore applicant, and in the case of onshore applications, Australia does apply the UN refugee convention, which I am sure Senator Short knows. That convention allows us to deny protection to people who have committed war crimes. In that context, decision makers have been instructed to bring to the attention of senior management cases that may invoke the exclusion provisions of the convention, and that is ongoing. In respect to the name of that person, I think I could probably get further advice later on and relay that to Senator Short.

There was a very interesting document released yesterday by the AMA&mdash;or at least its economic advisers, because the AMA commissioned the work from Access Economics&mdash;which points out that there is absolutely no crisis in private health insurance. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, while they could have been addressing the cost of private health insurance to young people, families and older Australians, they have been charging well above what was necessary and salting away that money in increased reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very telling, in the face of the claim that there is a crisis in the private health insurance industry. It entirely endorses recent reports, what the government has been saying and what I have been saying on behalf of the minister in this place: that there is no crisis in private health insurance. But none of that moves away from the point that young people, in the large part, are dropping out of private health insurance. That is the understanding and that is the evidence that is given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing about this report is that it points out that if one were looking at trying to keep more people in private health insurance&mdash;particularly young people&mdash;one would not want to increase the charges for private health insurance or maintain them at a high rate. The report is a dreadful vindication of what the government has been saying about there being no crisis in private health insurance; there is not.</PARA>

Because the private health funds have been raising the price, overcharging and salting away the profits for reserves, which they could have been passing on to people, making that price cheaper and, therefore, encouraging young people to take health insurance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is the government satisfied with the performance of the Australian Securities Commission? Does the government agree that the following factors are currently inhibiting the performance of the ASC: inefficiency, underfunding by the government, and political sensitivity? Is it not true that each of these factors is currently inhibiting the ASC? If the minister denies that any of them is operating to inhibit the ASC, which ones does he say are not so operating? Is it not true that the ASC recently offered funding limitations and political sensitivity as an excuse for apparent inefficiency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thought that the minister might be smart enough to avoid that, so that perhaps he could get some information. I will give him some clues: is it not true that the ASC failed to follow up concerns raised by some directors and the solicitors for Dennewan Limited because it judged it to be a mere internal dispute? Is it not also true that an inquiry by Arthur Andersen revealed a number of Crimes Act and Corporations Law offences have been committed by officers of Dennewan? Is it not equally true that funding for Aboriginal housing has been put at risk by the ASC's and ATSIC's inattention to this matter? Is it not also true that ATSIC knows of at least 12 other matters similar to Dennewan? The bottom line is: what is the Attorney-General going to do about it? Would he not be better advised to spend a little less time putting out press releases on reform of the private legal profession and a lot more time concentrating on public sector legal services and law enforcement, which is, after all, his direct responsibility?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC and other agencies involved in the national corporate regulatory scheme have an annual budget appropriation which is very significantly greater than the total funding previously provided to the former State and Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions, the former National Companies and Securities Commission and other relevant agencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC, like any other regulator, is required to prioritise its functions and direct its resources to those areas which it assesses as most requiring attention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), to a question without notice asked by Senator MacGibbon this day, relating to Australian Defence Force involvement in Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two key fundamentals in understanding the Rwandan situation. The first is that it is a matter of enormous complexity, both militarily and politically. There is a great humanitarian imperative because there are appalling atrocities being carried out in that country in what is a very brutal civil war that probably has origins that go back centuries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a small and poor country. The majority of the population, the Hutu, make up 70 or 80 per cent of the population, and the Tutsi around nine to 14 per cent. The Tutsis, which are the RPF, seem to be winning the war. They say that they can conquer the country without any outside help. They seem to have every intention of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no sign of any peace treaty being negotiated between the two parties. If there is no peace treaty, there is no role for the United Nations to go in as a peace-keeping force; because they need the cooperation of the community to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The larger issue of enforcing peace militarily is quite out of the question in the circumstances. Both parties have declared that they are quite opposed to any outside interference, including by the United Nations. There have probably been over half a million Rwandans killed in this bloody civil war and there are many hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them in appalling conditions in refugee camps on the borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no United Nations plan put in place to resolve this problem and, if there is no political plan, then there cannot be any military supporting plan. One does not commit troops and put their lives at risk for no purpose at all. On a lesser scale, one does not get involved in military campaigns that are open-ended and have no time schedule for their completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Militarily it is a very high risk situation. The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, is properly very concerned about safety. It is not a matter of arguing for absolute safety to commit forces but a matter of managed risk. There is a huge difference between being foolhardy or irresponsible on one hand and doing difficult and dangerous tasks, which the members of the ADF are prepared to do and which the parliament of Australia is prepared to accept the responsibility for committing those troops to do, when there is a realistic and attainable goal. This is a land-locked country. There is no seaport that can be secured. There is no airhead that can be secured. To move around a hostile countryside on indifferent roads and with poor communications means that the troops are exposed to considerable risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no suggestion at all that there is any prospect of a peace treaty in the immediate future, so armed conflict within the country will continue. There is no suggestion even that the warring factions will respect the refugee camps, that they will agree to make them safe havens, and that refugees in those camps will not be murdered by insurgents from either side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an open mind on this. I want to help because I think this is an appalling situation. I am quite sure that the majority of the Australian community wants to help too. The humanitarian imperatives here are pressing, the atrocities are enormous, and something needs to be done; but as yet the United Nations has not been able to come up with a plan. My proposition is that Australia must redouble its efforts diplomatically within the United Nations to get some brokered agreement between the warring parties. In the meantime, we should maintain our aid programs, mainly through NGOs, into the refugee camps, where conditions are appalling, until some sort of political settlement can be put in place. But I warn the government that until there is a plan that is workable, that is attainable, it has to think very seriously about putting Australian troops into that country. </PARA>

I do not disagree with many of the points he has raised about the degree of difficulty of the operation and the need for clarity about particular aspects of it before any decision to commit Australian troops could be made. I simply rise in order to clarify the record, if indeed it needs clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a suggestion from Senator MacGibbon that somehow in the estimates committee yesterday I had indicated that the government had already made a decision or had already committed that we were going to participate in this operation. That may have been the way in which some press reports came out, but that would have been a wholly distorted account of what I said. All I said was that the government was actively considering Australia's participation in UNAMIR, with consultations having taken place since my return from New York on Sunday morning as between Senator Ray and me, and that we were expecting to take the matter to cabinet within the week, probably next Monday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no assumption that a particular decision would be made by cabinet. It could be yes; it could be no; it could be yes perhaps, maybe, subject to certain conditions being satisfied. All those options are on the table, and they are still a matter of very active consideration by Senator Ray and me, not least in the context of the developments over the last 48 hours, with the proposal coming from the French government to embark, as Senator Ray said, upon a quite different kind of operation from that which has been contemplated by the UN so far&mdash;namely, a specific enforcement operation, and one operating in the southern and western parts of the country, where there is still very much contested territory as between the RPF and the interim government, and where also there is an environment of very real hostility towards the French forces in particular by the RPF. That has not been the case hitherto so far as the RPF and the interim government are concerned in relation to UNAMIR. There have been incidents of a most unfortunate kind, but in principle at least the RPF and the interim government have both accepted the legitimacy of UNAMIR. Whilst not agreeing to an effective cease-fire as between themselves, they have agreed to that so far as the UN operation is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these points not, as I say, in order to embark upon a substantive debate of the pros and cons but simply to reinforce the complexity of the situation, and to reinforce the point that further and better information about some aspects of the situation is very much still required before we can make any kind of decision on this. Although it is presently proposed that cabinet consider this next week, it is not to be assumed that any particular decision will emerge from that consideration. It will have to depend on a very close and balanced consideration of a very difficult issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only final point I would make is that of course the government shares the sense of horror and compassion, and the desperate feeling that something should be able to be done by the international community to stop an already appalling situation becoming worse. But we have learnt, unhappily, from a number of previous instances&mdash;an all too recent memory&mdash;that simply embarking upon UN operations because of the urge to be seen to be doing something is not a sufficient rationale. There has to be a sound operational concept. There has to be sound planning detail and the job that is identified has to be one that is doable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be assumed that these jobs will always be totally risk free, but one has to be confident that one can make a proper assessment of the balance of risks and weigh whatever risk is involved against a manifest advantage from the operation in question. All of those considerations will be on the table when we address this issue. </PARA>

The reality is that there are no figures available. She has reiterated on four occasions now that young people are leaving private health insurance and that, therefore, there is no crisis.

If one per cent drops out it costs the taxpayers $100 million. The total cost of health care is $34 billion; $15 billion of that is put in by the federal government&mdash;$2.4 billion of that from the Medicare levy, which is an inconsequential amount.

That is the total take. That is what it cost in 1992-93, for which the latest figures are available. </PARA>

She and the government&mdash;and I see it again in the ACTU-caucus working party&mdash;have ideological blinkers.

<PARA>In his answer today to my question concerning the migration to Australia of Abdul Qadir Miakhel, a former deputy chief of the Afghan secret police, Senator Bolkus initially said that he was not aware of the correspondence relating to this matter that was exchanged between the Afghan Freedom League in Australia and Senator Ray back in 1989. Therefore, he really did not answer my question but he came back after question time with certain additional information which I find very interesting but, more particularly, very concerning. What Senator Bolkus told the Senate by way of supplementary information after question time raises very serious concerns indeed about our screening of applicants for migration to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus said that Australia had granted permanent entry to a person who is alleged&mdash;as I understand it, this has never been denied&mdash;to have been the former deputy chief of the Afghan secret police, known as the Khad. It is known that particularly during the 1970s that organisation, under the repressive communist regime in Afghanistan, was responsible for the systematic torture of political prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuse Senator Bolkus gave as to how this fellow may have got into Australia was that the correspondence Senator Ray had had with the Afghan Freedom League was in 1989 but that Mr Miakhel had not applied for entry into Australia until August 1992, three years later, and that therefore it was understandable that the information about him that was available back in 1989 somehow or other got lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I find that quite extraordinary because the information contained in the letter from the Afghan Freedom League to the then minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, on 27 January 1989 was very specific indeed. It referred to Mr Miakhel and his background&mdash;not only was he the deputy chief of the secret police in Afghanistan but he was also apparently a high ranking officer and very active in the affairs of the KGB. All that information was on record with the then minister. The minister had replied to say that all this material and information had been conveyed to relevant posts. I assume that that would have to include New Delhi, and it was in New Delhi that Mr Miakhel's application for a special humanitarian visa&mdash;there is an irony&mdash;was lodged in August 1992 and approved in March 1993. The gentleman arrived here in April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus also said in response to me that all applications are assessed on character grounds. So this fellow was approved on character grounds. He was character tested, apparently, and not found out. Senator Bolkus also said, I think, that an investigation into how Mr Miakhel might have got through the character testing has been set in train. I hope we will get further information from the minister on that. In particular, I would want him to tell us when that investigation started. Was it after, and if so how long after? What was the basis for the investigation now being made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my starting point: whilst this is an issue of very serious concern in its own right, it does raise very serious concerns generally about the whole administration of the migration scheme, particularly in terms of the screening of applicants.

<PARA>I note that the minister did not reply to that part of the question which asked whether Mr Bannon had been headhunted by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee; nor did he indicate whether Mr Lee had headhunted Ms Wendy Silver; nor did he spell out what relevant qualifications, skills and commercial expertise Ms Silver would bring to this important position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great concern to all Australians who regard the ABC as a very significant national institution that it should be run by those who are pre-eminent in their fields. That is not to say that under no circumstances should we ever have people who are members of political parties or who have been serving politicians. What it does mean is that a person ought to have some other track record, some level of achievement that would qualify him or her for what is a very significant national appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once these appointments have been confirmed by the Executive Council next week, we will have a nine-member board with a majority which consists of an ex-Labor pollster, an ex-Labor ministerial staffer, two former trade union officials and an ex-Labor premier. The requirements for non-executive board directors are contained in section 12(5) of the Australian Broadcasting Act, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(5)</EMPHASIS> A person shall not be appointed as non-executive Director unless he . . . had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting or television services or in communications or management . . . expertise in financial or technical matters, or by reason of his having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The government cannot pretend that somehow someone manages to slide in under those headings. Without being too personal, my understanding of Ms Silver's qualifications is that she has a degree in social work, she was a ministerial staffer for a period of years and she was appointed to the lotteries commission by the last state Labor government. She has now been put forward as someone with relevant credentials for this position. They are certainly not readily apparent to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator McMullan to pretend that somehow the board contains people with a broad range of qualifications simply ignores the fact that we do not have anyone with commercial expertise. There are businessmen around the country who have proud track records, are leaders in commerce and industry and are captains in their field who would be perfect appointments to the board. I dare say some of them have been quite close to the Labor government over the last decade or more. Yet we have a board that is notable for a complete absence of anyone with commercial qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the fact that the board is going to have to make a number of very sensitive judgments about the ABC's continuing involvement in pay television and satellite television and a number of judgments about other commercial activities, the last thing we want is a board that looks like Australia in terms of agenda and political attachments and does not have anyone with all those other very important criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan pretends that there is balance in terms of politics. For the life of me I cannot see anyone that stands out as having been associated with any party other than the Labor Party. That is a matter of great concern and regret both within and outside the ABC. The ABC does not want to be a matter of high political controversy. It does not want to be bedevilled by debate about the affiliations of its board members. It wants to be sensitive. It wants to be independent. It wants to maintain impartiality. It simply cannot do that when it has foisted upon it people whose primary credentials are that they have been very close to the Labor Party over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the way we are going to go in this country, if great public institutions are going to be treated as prizes to be given at the gift of the minister, I think the government is simply lowering the standard and reputation of those bodies and it will suffer accordingly. It seems to me that when we talk about balance we are simply echoing the way the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, used the term when he talked about balanced coverage. He means balance his way. If that is what the government has in mind it is simply not good enough for national institutions and it should not be good enough for the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These motions relate to the section of the ordinances that would allow R and X computer and video games into the ACT and, therefore, from our experience previously with videos, the rest of Australia. It has been of great concern since the development of this modern technology that R and X computer and video games, like videos before them, would spread across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards was so concerned about this matter that it held a series of hearings across Australia. It collected evidence from industry, consumers and, interestingly enough, school children about the effect of these video games. This problem came home to me most recently when a friend of my daughter's was visiting. I mentioned what we were doing in the Senate and she said that her mother's boyfriend had a game called mortal combat. What she described was absolutely disgusting. As a minor she is open to observing these sorts of games because they are in the house and readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very disturbing that, with this new technology, these things are becoming increasingly available. The evidence that our committee gathered indicated that the extrasensory intensity of computer video games is way above that of video and that the mental effects of repetitive play of this sort of material are extremely dangerous to children. We are also concerned about the lack of long-term research in this area and the long-term effects of children's exposure to this sort of material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore recommended in its report last November that with this material we should only allow up to the MA classification. Towards the end of last year this was considered by the state ministers responsible for censorship. Unfortunately, at that time they agreed to accept the recommendation of the Office of Film and Literature Classification to allow a full range up to R and X on this sort of material&mdash;admittedly with a modified standard&mdash;in each area. This was of great concern. Censorship being a state matter, it was up to the states to determine which levels they would accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently we were very concerned that some states and territories might accept the R and X classifications for computer video games. One by one, they all backed down. The last one to back down was the ACT. I pay tribute to my colleague John Hannaford, the Attorney-General in New South Wales, for his advocacy of removing R and X categories. I heard a very interesting debate between him and the ACT Attorney-General in which I felt John Hannaford put the arguments very strongly. In recent times we have seen the ACT finally backing down and its parliament deciding not to have the R and X categories. Therefore, my notices of motion, the original intention of which was to stop R and X rated games coming into the ACT, are no longer needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Governor-General signed the documents to change the ordinance to take out R and X classifications. Having examined what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had intended and what actually happened, we are now satisfied that this matter has been properly covered. I thank the Attorney-General for his prompt attention to this matter, for his personal correspondence with me assuring me that he would do this and for his recent actions speeding it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Senate procedure, I note that what sped up this matter in the Attorney-General's office were these notices of motion and the fact that when they were brought down today they would have created enormous legal problems unless the federal government had sorted out this matter. It has now been sorted out. We have a uniform standard across Australia whereby all states and territories do not allow R and X classifications. It is a very responsible decision by government and it is a very rapid response to a very rapidly changing technology. I believe the outcome works for the protection of the children of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of public funding to the ACTU under the guise of the Trade Union Training Authority is clearly a matter of public importance and an issue that the opposition believes should be drawn to the attention of all Australians. In recent times my friend and colleague Senator Crane and I have exposed an incestuous cesspit of political corruption and intrigue.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amazing; members of the Labor Party are already interjecting because we have hit them where it hurts. The Trade Union Training Authority has a web of absolute intrigue and corruption right around it. Ostensibly, the Trade Union Training Authority is an independent statutory authority devoted to training trade unionists. In recent Senate estimates committee hearings a tale of intrigue has been revealed despite the best attempts of the ALP-ACTU-TUTA triangle to obfuscate the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with some of the specific examples that have come to light. Firstly, the executive officer of TUTA, Ms Wood, without the knowledge or concurrence of her executive council and without any consultation with her information services manager, made an unilateral decision to transfer the information service from the Clyde Cameron College in Albury-Wodonga to ACTU headquarters. The deal provided that two-thirds of the assets were provided by the statutory authority&mdash;by the taxpayers&mdash;and one-third of the assets were contributed by the ACTU, yet the agreement that was struck made the two parties equal partners, tenants in common in equal shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute disgrace. There is no ground on any sound business footing to justify that sort of arrangement. Any prudent business person would say, `I have contributed two-thirds of the assets. I should therefore have a controlling say in the running of the operation.' Of course, it did not really matter because the Trade Union Training Authority is only the plaything of the ACTU and its board is dominated by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the agreement that I refer to is that it was signed on 12 March 1993, the day before the last federal election. Why the indecent haste? Why did Ms Wood not tell her information manager about this deal, that her empire was going to be moved into ACTU headquarters? Why did she tell the staff 14 days before the election that it was a fait accompli? The reason is that Ms Wood wanted to frustrate the Liberal policy, which had been clearly enunciated, to sell TUTA. Of course, if TUTA's assets were intertwined with those of the ACTU, it would make it so much more difficult to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, a few months before that in October 1992 Ms Wood allowed the Trade Union Training Authority to enter into a lease arrangement with the ACTU, moving its headquarters into ACTU headquarters. This lease was for six years at $300,000 per annum. If the Liberals had won and had sold off TUTA it would have had to fork out $1.8 million to the ACTU because of this ongoing lease arrangement that had been deliberately stitched together to frustrate any future Liberal government&mdash;$1.8 million of taxpayers' funds deliberately going into the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that with the restructuring of the Trade Union Training Authority we have a situation where it has closed all but twp state offices in Australia. Can honourable senators guess where those two offices are housed? They are housed in the ACTU headquarters and in the Miscellaneous Workers Union building in Sydney. So landlords of TUTA that happen to be trade unions have had their leases guaranteed&mdash;no problems&mdash;but private landlords have had their leases extinguished because the authority is now funding only the trade union offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the information service from Clyde Cameron College to the ACTU was in the guise of a joint venture agreement between TUTA and Brittvale, a wholly owned ACTU company. It is interesting what a company search will reveal. Ms Jennie George, an executive member and director secretary of this company Brittvale, is also the executive chairperson of the Trade Union Training Authority. She gets paid by the ACTU while having her income subsidised by the taxpayers of Australia through the money she gets paid by TUTA, of which she is the executive chairperson. In anybody's language, Ms George has a conflict of interest. A clearer, more unambiguous conflict of interest is hard to imagine. Yet Ms George never declared this conflict. The opposition had to chase the paper trail and find its way through the maze of intrigue to expose this gross conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Wood's response when that situation was put to her yesterday in the Senate estimates committee was: `We don't make inquiries into the organisations with which we have contracts.' The authority does not bother making inquiries! If it is the ACTU it is okay. It says, `We do not have to bother with that; that is okay because we are really the plaything of the ACTU.' No due diligence was undertaken by the Trade Union Training Authority; there was no checking up in any shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 22 of the Trade Union Training Authority Act there was a clear and unambiguous obligation on Ms George to declare that interest. She failed to do so. It was never recorded in the minutes and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, kindly agreed to get legal advice on whether Ms George should stand aside. In the meantime Ms George should stand aside to ensure that there is no further allegation of conflict of interest. It was a matter serious enough for the minister to acknowledge. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to another point. The manager, Ms Jenny Luck, resigned to contest the election as the Labor candidate for Indi.

What did Ms Luck tell the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Mail</EMPHASIS>, the local paper? She is reported as saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was about to refer to the paranoia of the Liberal Party, but I am getting a little paranoid myself after the waste of my speaking time during that superfluous discussion of points of order. What is of concern to me is the fact that young, ambitious and sensitive senators from the Liberal side now feel that the way to succeed in the Liberal Party is to attack homosexuals, unionists and foreigners. That is their sort of creed&mdash;appeal to the prejudice, appeal to the paranoia of the Liberal Party and its closest supporters. We have heard Senator Abetz, in his short time in this place, defending attacks on homosexuals, the United Nations and foreigners generally. Now it is the unionists' turn. The old whipping boy for the conservatives is to attack trade unionists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central point to all of this is that Senator Abetz has used his great forensic skills in the estimates committee process, and he has found us out. The Australian Labor Party federal government is funding trade union training in Australia. We have been found out; we are guilty. We have been guilty since 1975. Malcolm Fraser was guilty. But we admit it; we are guilty. We are funding, with public funds, trade union training in Australia. We are proud of it, and we are going to continue to do it. If the Liberal Party had not shifted so much to the right, it would continue the tripartite support for that initiative&mdash;the support that was shown by the Fraser government, and the support that has been shown by employer bodies around Australia. I have served with employer representatives on the WA state council of the Trade Union Training Authority. They have made a constructive contribution, as I believe I did during my term there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz thinks he has caught us out. Good for you, senator! It is a great discovery. As I pointed out to him last night, in 1903 the parliament of Australia recognised the role of trade unions and gave them a significant role in our compulsory conciliation and arbitration system. So we have had a recognition by the federal parliament of the importance of trade unions since 1903. But Senator Abetz has just found that out. He has just caught on to the fact that governments actually encourage trade unions&mdash;governments of all persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last nearly 20 years, governments of all persuasions have supported trade union training. Why? Because it is in the national interest. There has been tripartite support for trade union training, because it is in the national interest. Better prepared shop stewards, better informed shop stewards and better trained shop stewards are better able to deal with industrial relations in the workplace. Since the inception of TUTA, we have had a declining level of industrial disputation. A lot of that credit must go to the accord. But part of the reason for that has been the role of TUTA, which has been acknowledged by employers and by Liberal Party members over many years. It has assisted in bringing about better relations in the workplace by properly training trade union shop stewards. It has had the support of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also provided support for industry. We helped train managers in industrial relations both in our tech colleges and universities, and in providing training funds to employer groups. So there is nothing new about this. Senator Abetz may be new to it. He may not know anything about industrial relations, but there has been 20 years of public funding of trade union training in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been two changes recently. The first change is in TUTA. It has moved to devolve its training to the trade unions, and just provide a central core function. That is a decision that has been taken to provide better training. Part of the outcome of this decision was to set up a joint venture with the ACTU to provide library and information services so that information was accessible to the clients. The important thing about the Trade Union Training Authority is that its clients are the trade unions of Australia. It does have a close relationship with them. It works with them because they are its client base. They are the people it was established to serve under the charter given to it by this parliament. So to suddenly discover this fact and alleged conspiracy is a complete nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change has been in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party has moved to the right. It adopted Fightback and, despite the bipartisan support for trade union training that existed for nearly 20 years, the Liberal Party has taken on a policy of closing TUTA. That is its right. I think it is a sad thing, and I think a lot of people in business suggest that it is a sad thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, those are the important changes, and that is why we hear Senator Abetz using words like `incestuous cesspit'. Where does this bloke get off? This is just an outrageous slur. He can get headlines in Tasmania by slurring homosexuals. He can get headlines in Tasmania by slurring unionists. It may get him headlines, but it does nothing for public policy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason there is a close relationship between the ACTU, the trade union movement and TUTA is that TUTA is there to serve that client base. The important thing to be said about the joint venture agreement is that it is in the public interest. It is cost efficient. It will actually save the taxpayers of Australia $1.2 million annually, and it will provide better training. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the board of TUTA comprises an 11 member executive of which there are six trade union members. The executive director, Ms Wood, has a long history of trade union involvement; in fact, she has served on the executive of the ACTU, which shows through in the decision making process. This deal was put together in secret without consultation with the executive council and signed one day before the last federal election. The purpose of the deal was to move assets out of TUTA into a joint venture with the ACTU because of the policy position that we had at the time of the election. It is pointless debating whether our policy position was right or wrong. The fact is that those assets were removed secretly without consultation with the executive council. It would be interesting to know whether or not there was any discussion with the minister on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question on the transfer of public funds through TUTA to the ACTU, Ms Wood said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our 1994 budget there is an allocation of up to $5 million for the administration of a grant program which would see moneys paid directly to trade unions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>If it was the government's intention to pay $5 million to the trade union movement, why did it not just write out a cheque and send it directly to the ACTU and get rid of all the attendant administrative nonsense? Ms Wood went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Union Training Authority has allocated up to $250,000 to be paid in traineeships as an acknowledgment of time spent in off-the-job training by trainees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this was a direct allocation of public funds through TUTA. There are proper processes by which these things should be done and I do not think one of the processes should be through TUTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to look briefly at Brittvale. This shelf company was bought by the ACTU approximately one week prior to the last federal election. As I have said, the joint venture agreement was signed the day before the election, without the knowledge of the executive council. Here was a deal stitched together in secret to avoid the policy position adopted by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting&mdash;and Senator Abetz touched on this matter briefly&mdash;that TUTA's contribution to the assets was $102,000 and the ACTU's contribution was $29,000. I am not particularly concerned about what the ACTU does with its assets, but I am concerned about what the TUTA does with its assets, which have been transferred into this company. I have already indicated that some members of the TUTA board are controlled by the ACTU and that $102,000 of public funds was involved. Senator Evans claimed that this was done to make those assets more accessible to clients. I believe that that claim is neither factual nor fair. There has never been any suggestion in this place that clients did not have access to library facilities. However, there is a major distortion in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the asset backing of Brittvale was not checked as to whether or not it was a $2 company, a 50c  company or whatever. And there has been no follow-up to find out whether the ACTU legally transferred its share of the assets. That came out quite clearly in the debate that took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at the guidelines under which these grants operate. Not only are funds provided for training but also, in addition, funding ranging from $37,371 to $49,095 is available to pay the salaries of individuals who are trained in either the ACTU or one of the eligible federal unions. It is worth noting, as was pointed out at the estimates hearing last night, that state unions are not eligible to apply. Yet the salaries of these individuals are being provided from ongoing funding. That goes far beyond the role of training trade union officials. </PARA>

<PARA>Last night I questioned this guideline. It was made quite clear to us that, if one employed a TUTA trainer funded from the public purse, one's application would get priority regardless of whether that person was the right person to do the training or whether the application for the training grant was the best one. So there is a misplaced priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that needs to be borne in mind in considering the way that this joint venture agreement was rushed into with Brittvale is that the executive director of TUTA told us that she did not know, initially, who were the directors of Brittvale. Yet, later in the estimates proceedings I asked her to check the public record and, if necessary, correct it. She informed us that it did not matter whether she was dealing with the directors of Brittvale&mdash;namely, Jennie George, Bill Kelty and Ian Ross&mdash;or whether she was dealing with the ACTU. So here we see a whole misappropriation of funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, express my sorrow at what has transpired&mdash;the sorry saga that has been put here this afternoon. What is sorry about it is the fact that this is not an issue that concerns high principle; it is not an issue of deep concern in respect of public policy. In my judgment, it reflects the extraordinary ignorance and hypocrisy of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the Liberal Party has demonstrated its complete refusal to understand the fundamentals of this program and the role of the Trade Union Training Authority. The Liberal Party's understanding is so misguided that it has failed to recognise that, even under a Liberal government, policies have been pursued to support the Trade Union Training Authority. We have seen a savage shift in the thinking of the Liberal Party, which reflects its abiding hatred of workers and its complete rejection of the needs and rights of workers to effective training. We hear nothing in the complaints of the Liberal Party about the training of managers and supervisors at our universities, our institutes of technologies, CAEs or TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not hear any recognition that the government spends tens of millions of dollars each year on the training of management in this society. We do not recognise that graduate schools of management turn out increasing numbers of MBAs, fully trained to deal with personnel matters and trade unions. We do not hear any talk about the industrial relations assistance given to management in its attempts to undermine the worth of workers and trade unions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ask ourselves the obvious question: why is it that the Liberal Party is so keen to avoid the same rights conferred on the working people of this country? We do not hear any recognition that in 1992-93, $18 million was distributed for training in terms of reform and best practice programs. Employers received $11 million of that money, but unions received only $4 million. The joint employers and union projects amounted to $0.7 million. Others got $2.75 million. The same pattern was demonstrated in the 1993-94 estimates where we saw that $11 million was being allocated, and the overwhelming bulk of that going to management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not see any recognition of the true nature of training in this country and the benefits that it brings to our economy and our society as a whole. What we do see is a vicious attack on trade unions and on the citizens of this country yet again; and an attack on the use of this Senate&mdash;and the use of estimates committees in particular on this occasion&mdash;to  undermine the credibility of people and destroy where possible the reputations of our citizens, be they officials of the ACTU or public servants. That is an appalling use of this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a didactic approach being taken throughout the proceedings, we see tendentious points being made again and again, and we see the generally inane style that is adopted by the conservative senators on these matters. We hear vicious allegations of laundering of public moneys and outrageous claims made about the activities of individuals. When we look at this carefully and examine the facts, none of the allegations made have any support whatsoever. For instance, on the question of the leasing of buildings, we do not hear any recognition that the audit process has been undertaken in that matter. All we hear is the slur and innuendo being presented by the small-time suburban lawyers from the other side of this chamber. Ultimately, there is a denigration of this parliament and the processes of this Senate. What we are seeing ultimately is a desperate opposition which, quite frankly, despises the fact that it lost the election and that it cannot see any future in terms of winning an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen allegations made about the so-called joint venture arrangement being heavily in favour of the ACTU. When we look at the facts&mdash;not just at the capital acquisitions of this joint venture or the books and journals and so on that began the joint venture&mdash;when we look at the recurrent expenditure involved in the process we see that so far, from the Trade Union Training Authority side of the operation, $239,000 has been allocated and from the ACTU, $349,000 has been allocated. Since the ACTU's commitment is on a recurrent basis, we can see the distribution and that a disproportionate share coming from the ACTU is growing quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen some vicious allegations levelled against Jennie George and some quite vile and contemptible claims made in the press about her. But we do not hear any of the facts, such as that Jennie George is an unpaid director of Brittvale. She holds no shares in it and has no beneficial interest in it. Brittvale was established by the ACTU simply so that it could enter into a contract with the trade union authority, as the ACTU is an unincorporated association which cannot contract in its own right. Through the whole process this has been stated quite clearly but we have slurs and innuendoes from the muckrakers and the great heroes who sit in this place or on estimates committees and use the powers of this Senate to attack their political opponents. Anybody who does not agree with Senator Abetz has to be seen as a political opponent. Anyone is fair game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those opposite fail to acknowledge in this whole process is that this hot gospeller, pulpiteer approach to politics where we see union bashing writ large is an attempt to somehow try to generate the notion that one is talking about public policy. What one is talking about is the prosecution of vendettas against people in the community.Liberal senators obviously find great difficulty in recognising that trade unions have any rights in terms of the proper training of workers or their proper place in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen allegations levelled against executive officers of TUTA; we have seen allegations levelled against Jenny Luck. Claims have been made that she was improperly re-employed after an election. It seems that the rights of a Labor candidate defeated in an election are such that she is not entitled to be re-employed, but that is a right every other citizen is able to claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard shocking suggestions made that somehow or other the familiar arrangement between members of TUTA and the ACTU executive should be held up. We should ask people who they are sleeping with. Essentially, that is what was done last night by the opposition. I know it is a big stunt in Tasmania to play the game of the politics of the bedroom, but it is not the sort of thing that should be done at an estimates committee. We should not be asking public servants who they are married to and what sort of relationship they have with other people, on the basis of their private lives. That is a foul abuse of this Senate and of the processes of this parliament. It is absolutely and totally contemptible that people should try to make these sorts of claims under the benefit of privilege in an attempt to try to intimidate people and abuse the rights of ordinary citizens&mdash;in this case, public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Senate that this obviously is a campaign run by the most degenerate elements of the Liberal Party. It has no substance whatsoever and was designed to cover up the basic fact that it has no claim to make these allegations; there is no substance to them. I hope that people who might be listening to this broadcast&mdash;I do not suppose many will be&mdash;will have understood the question: what is the evidence to support the vicious smears that have been levelled against citizens of this country? We come back to the point: where does the Liberal Party stand on these basic questions of civil liberties? It is ignorant and chooses to be ignorant. It will remain ignorant; and as a consequence it will not enjoy the confidence of the people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate my colleague Senator Abetz on bringing this very important matter to the attention of the Senate. It is the first matter of public importance that he has brought on. He has picked a very important topic and, moreover, he has done it very well. What he has raised are very important issues of principle and morality, and questions of the use and misuse of public funds&mdash;and public funds are nothing other than taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go over all the points in relation to the shabby, shameful TUTA affair that Senator Abetz and my other friend and colleague Senator Crane have so ably dealt with. What I do want to look at are some of the wider issues of the relationship between this Labor government and the trade union movement. I do not believe that the people of Australia are aware of the way in which this government has rorted the taxes of this country to provide funds to the trade union movement which, in other ways, have flowed back to the ALP for many of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, there are very special relationships between the trade union movement, the Australian Labor Party and the Labor government. The trade union movement has a unique relationship with one political party, the ALP, which no other non-party interest group has. It occurs at a number of levels. Many unions are affiliated with the ALP. This gives the unions extensive powers within the Labor Party and, therefore, within the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP policy platform formally highlights the special emphasis that the trade union movement has within the ALP. This is translated at a practical level in many ways which give the trade union movement great strength within the Labor Party and, therefore, the decision making processes of Labor governments. In turn, unions contribute a percentage of their members' union dues to the ALP regardless, I point out, of the political persuasion of the individual members. In addition to that, affiliation fees are sent to the ALP from affiliated unions. That figure is reportedly of the order of $5 million a year, and that is in addition to the other payments I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, with the ALP in power, the union movement has a very special relationship with the government. That has been evident right through the 11 years of this Labor government. The power of the trade union movement, particularly of the office bearers of the ACTU, has been unparalleled in this country. Indeed, in a radio interview during the election campaign in 1990 the president of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a partner in government with the ALP . . . and we are part and parcel of the government of Australia and prepared to be identified with the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA>Jennie George, of whom much has been said in this debate by my colleagues, said a very similar thing after the 1993 election to the effect that it was the trade union movement that had won the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of grave significance is the union movement's special tax status that provides advantages to the ALP. In addition to having the special relationship with the ALP, the bulk of the union movement's finances come from tax free sources. This has a number of ramifications because of the electoral disclosure requirements of the ALP and for other reasons. The trade unions are granted exemptions from tax on income under section 23F of the Income Tax Assessment Act. They also raise funds from union subscriptions which are compulsorily levied at the workplace on all union members&mdash;as I said, regardless of the individual union members' political support&mdash;and the subscriptions are also tax deductible by union members. Again, the impact of this on the ALP is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I want to draw attention to&mdash;this is perhaps the most important of all, and the greatest rort of all&mdash;is the government grant funding to unions and, in turn, the flow back of that funding, which uses taxpayers' money, to the ALP. The Keating government's use of taxpayers' money to fund its industrial wing more than rivals in dollars the sports rorts affair that recently brought down Ros Kelly. I have been following this subject for many years and the latest figures that I have received through questions on notice reveal that trade unions received a minimum payout of $14.4 million in the last election year, 1992-93, a 40 per cent increase on the $10.2 million received in 1991-92. The minimum handout to the trade union movement over the life of the Hawke-Keating government is over $66 million. The annual figure has increased each year. In 1992-93 it was more than six times greater than the figure for Labor's first year in government. I seek leave to table a list of the payments to trade union movements by the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the role of trade unions in educating their members. For some years certain organisations in the trade union movement have allocated funds from their overall income for education&mdash;for instance, the metalworkers allocated something like four per cent of their total income&mdash;and they have been lucky that on many occasions enlightened employers have agreed to pay the wages of workers' representatives attending particular courses. That is obviously an acknowledgment by employers that it is useful to train people to carry out their job efficiently and effectively.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a truly extraordinary debate today. The definition of `public funding' is `government spending or subsidy from the public purse'. By far the greatest amount of subsidy in the area of training goes to industry, in the form of vocational and industrial training, labour market assistance to job seekers and industry and employment services. The emphasis on training in both the secondary and tertiary education sectors, as opposed to education, also constitutes a huge subsidy to industry. We are talking about billions of dollars here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz professes to be outraged that the Trade Union Training Authority has close links with the executive of the union movement in Australia. It would be a strange thing indeed if it did not. How else could TUTA be expected to provide training that is relevant to the needs of trade unionists in the light of the recent and complex changes in work practices which are being driven by industry, recent legislative changes and the acknowledged need for Australia to move to world best practice in both management and work relations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are on the TUTA board as well. The benefits of such a facility are much wider than the union movement. TUTA is often engaged directly by employers. We have heard this today. Let me the give Senate some examples of the value that TUTA is providing in Western Australia as we speak. Currently 12 shop stewards are receiving training in a three-day job representation 2 course. Each of them has undergone a three-day job representation course with aspirations of undertaking a job representation 3 course in the future. Their aspiration is the provision of high quality representation of the employees they represent both in the workplace and within their respective unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of 21 individuals are receiving a five-day skills course for organisers. The course, which has an excellent reputation, is being delivered in Perth for the first time&mdash;it is usually presented on a national basis at the Clyde Cameron College of TUTA. Again, the objective is the skills enhancement of organisers in the context of rapid change in industrial relations. Each course runs from 8.30 to 4.30 p.m. daily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week the centre will be open for 40 hours and during that time there will be 987 hours of skill enhancement and awareness training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course content for all training occurring this minute in Western Australia is based on 20 years of TUTA experience and is TUTA accredited, with associated quality control. The opposition needs to ask itself whether the same high quality, high intensity, high efficiency training can be guaranteed out of the innumerable schools of management around Australia which receive the direct and indirect benefit of millions of dollars of federal government funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broadly agreed economic reform process has as a central character the union movement. Through the painful transition, TUTA has played a central role in the delivery of high quality information and skills enhancement to engender a coherent approach to change. Again, the union bashers in the opposition need to ask themselves whether the schools of management have been as conscientious in their constant revision of curricula and training methods. With the devolution of training from centralised TUTA facilities to union-based trainers, the TUTA efforts at continuous improvement and increased efficiency in training delivery are again manifest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions in Western Australia remain committed to the maintenance of high standards of TUTA accredited training. The Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia continues to negotiate with TUTA on the provision and level of Trades and Labour Council-based training capacity required for direct delivery and to coordinate delivery of training by others to the full range of unions in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Senator Abetz and his union-hating cohorts on the opposition benches forget that the right of workers to organise is a basic human right, a right for which people in history have fought and died. Public subsidy to industry in its many forms is increasing in Australia, and this includes tax handbacks as well as very large training subsidies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we broke for lunch I was talking about the government's proposal to increase the pension age for women from 60 to 65. Some evidence was put before the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs&mdash;which the Department of Social Security acknowledged&mdash;that the vast majority of women affected by this proposal, at least 80 per cent, would be moving onto various alternative forms of income support, such as the partner allowance, JSA, Newstart, the new widow's allowance or perhaps the mature age allowance. Ironically, these last two allowances have been recently introduced by the government because it has been forced to recognise that in the current climate older unemployed workers are going to experience great difficulty in finding and keeping work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government announced the mature age allowance, it said that was an acknowledgment of the great difficulty unemployed male workers over 60 had in keeping and finding employment. The situation is hardly going to be any better for women over the age of 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin, announced the new widows allowance&mdash;which will be available to women aged 50 or over who become separated, divorced or widowed and who have no recent work force experience&mdash;he said it was in recognition of the fact that these women `may have difficulty meeting the activity test and gaining employment'. On the one hand the government is saying that it needs to introduce new allowances and make new arrangements because it is unfair to expect those older workers to jump through the hoops and over the hurdles in order to get jobs that really do not exist anyway. On the other hand it is saying, `It's okay for women over 60 now. They don't need the pension, they can go out and find a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that most of the women affected by this change are either going to be struggling to find and keep relatively poorly paid and insecure jobs or they will be living on allowances which pay them less than the age pension, have fewer fringe benefits and are far less secure. In other words, their job prospects will be no better and their income will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women on low incomes and with insecure employment will be the hardest hit by this measure. As Adele Horin pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well-off men (and a handful of women) will still be able to retire at 55, taking their ample superannuation with them. Even though taxpayers have heavily subsidised that super, the Government shows no willingness to force such people to work until 65 before they can have access to their super. Imagine the outcry!</PARA>
<PARA>That is the basic unfairness in this change; it will force women at the less well-off end of the labour market to work until they are 65 in jobs which do not have much to offer them in the way of income, security, training or superannuation. Meanwhile, at the top end of the work force, well-paid workers will still be able to collect their super packages, perhaps as early as 55, no doubt by the age of 60. The low income earners will grind on until the age of 65 having helped subsidise their well-paid work mates into early retirement. I really do not know what the government calls that, but I do not call it fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the situation for older women&mdash;for women in the work force generally&mdash;is likely to improve a little over the next decade, but we have no idea how significant that improvement will be. We have no idea what the effects of enterprise bargaining will be, for example. We all know it could simply increase the gap between the well-paid, articulate professional women and those in poorly paid, low skilled jobs, particularly casual jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the work done on women and superannuation by the Queensland women's policy unit indicates, there is a strong possibility that occupation based superannuation may in the long term operate to the disadvantage of women workers. So we just do not know whether things are going to get that much better for women in the work force over the next 10 years. Yet, by the end of that 10 years, by the year 2006, Australian women will be retiring at the age of 63. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other disappointing aspect of this debate is that we have seen very little evidence that the government has given any serious thought at all to any of the alternatives. For example, why can we not have a serious, informed public debate about whether there is any merit in progressively lowering the men's pension age to 60? Is it feasible? Is it something that the community wants and, perhaps more importantly, is this something the community is prepared to pay for? Would it make any difference, for example, to the availability of jobs for younger people? What about the compromise of moving to equalise both men's and women's pensions perhaps at the age of 62 or 63? Why can we not look at a stepped pension system&mdash;introducing a reduced age pension at earlier ages&mdash;as some European countries do and then perhaps offering bonuses or incentives for people who postpone retirement to the age of 65 or beyond?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are ideas which deserve widespread public debate and discussion, but that does not look like it is going to happen. The government has not wanted that because it knows it has the numbers in this parliament to force this change through. As I said previously, the government has lifted this idea straight out of Fightback and knows that it is going to waltz through this Senate with the support of the coalition. It has not bothered to look at the other options. It has not bothered to talk to the women of Australia to look at how it will affect them personally. The Democrats will be opposing this measure. We will be moving two alternative amendments&mdash;one to progressively bring the male pension age down to 60 and the other to push back the time frame for the change in the women's pension another 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few remaining minutes I am going to look at the disability wage supplement. This supplement is a way of getting people with disabilities into the mainstream work force by providing a productivity based wage paid by their employer but supplemented with an income tested payment from the government. The new supportive wages system, which has been endorsed by the government, the ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, offers people with disabilities, who would not normally be able to access this labour market and who would not normally be able to find employment at full award rates, the chance to move out of sheltered employment situations and into that general work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the thinking behind this new system is laudable but we have a couple of concerns about the way in which this will actually operate. Firstly, we are concerned about the link between the disability support pension and the disability wage supplement. For example, several organisations have raised with me the issue of people needing to get back on the disability support pension after being on the disability wage supplement due to their jobs no longer existing or their being forced out of their positions. What prevents the DSS saying that these people are not eligible for a pension any longer because they have demonstrated by being on the supplement that they are able to work and they no longer meet the criteria of having a continuing inability to work, which is a requirement for the pension? They are then going to be forced back onto the jobsearch allowance and have to meet all the various requirements that it takes in order to get that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the legislation reads at the moment, these people will have to lodge a new claim for the pension, go back to square one, wait four to six weeks for another medical examination and then wait another two weeks before their claim is assessed. Surely a far better and a fairer approach would be to allow people coming off the supplement to be judged as automatically eligible to go back onto the pension. This would not stop the Department of Social Security reviewing these people at some later time, but it would ensure that there is no gap in income support in the meantime. I believe that it would also cut out a lot of bureaucratic duplication. The Democrats will be moving amendments to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I am concerned about the process of assessment. Under this scheme, employees will be assessed through a process of negotiation involving the employer, the employee and either a trade union representative or an accredited assessor. Those assessors are obviously going to play a pivotal role in ensuring a fair deal for the disabled employees. I would like to know how many assessors have been or will be appointed. Are they going to be new appointments or will we effectively be expecting existing DSS and DHSH staff to take on this function in addition to their existing functions? Where will they be based? Will they be able to provide a service for people in all parts of Australia, particularly rural Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, where a sub-award wage is to be paid, superannuation contributions will be paid at this reduced rate. That is a concern. I would like to know whether or not the government plans to re-examine the question of superannuation for these employees and whether it is willing to look at topping up to the full rate with a government supplement at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as this is an untried and untested system, perhaps the most important thing is for the government to evaluate this scheme after 12 months. A number of groups are urging the government to simply see this first year of operation as a trial period and to do a full evaluation of it after that period of time. I would certainly like to hear the minister's response to that and whether the government already has a full plan for an evaluation or has built a review into the scheme at any point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chamber has before it the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which contains a range of measures affecting a number of areas in the Social Security Act. It seems we will never be free of social security bills. On past and present performance almost every one of them will contain corrections due to previous oversights, bad drafting or the government will be wanting to change things due to unintended consequences. This bill contains what would be described as `the works' if it were a hamburger menu item.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say, however, that the first part of the bill, the disability wage supplement, fits into none of those categories. It is by any evaluation a positive measure designed to add to the dignity of people with disabilities who are able to participate in employment. The disability wage supplement was announced at the time of the 1993 budget and is now finding its way into legislation. The Greens welcome this move. I know that it is the result of extensive consultation by the government with the disability networks over a considerable period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the disability wage supplement is to enable people to maintain a partial income from the disability support pension if they take up work at reduced rates of pay calculated according to their productive capacity. There are, however, some concerns. The legislation has been written in such a way that, if a person participates in the disability wage supplement but then moves out of employment, he or she will not automatically revert to a disability support pension. This defies logic as a person's involvement in the disability wage supplement scheme is predicated on their being a disability support pension recipient prior to entering the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If such a person was on the disability support pension when he or she began work and moved onto the disability wage supplement as a result of taking up a job, why on earth should that person not be able to go back to the disability support pension without re-establishing qualifications? As the disability support pension is subject to review, let the review process pick up any changes, but for goodness sake do not put people through more hoops, particularly if their self-esteem has been damaged by an inability to maintain a job. I hope to hear that an amendment to address this is forthcoming from the government. The Democrats, through Senator Lees, have also addressed some of the concerns in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to imprisonment provisions. The bill also incorporates what is now a standard provision in the principal act in relation to penalties for failure to provide information about changes in a recipient's circumstances. New sections relating to the disability wage supplement scheme provide that a person may be gaoled for six months for failure to comply with a notice given by the department. In my view this is utterly inappropriate. It may be seen to be routine, but it is ridiculous to be using imprisonment penalties as enforcement for administrative responsibilities for a group that is already trying to gain some redress through the disability wage supplement scheme. I will be putting amendments before the Senate in relation to this&mdash;I believe they have been circulated&mdash;and maybe some changes in similar sections, and I will save my detailed remarks for the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would at this point state categorically that it is absolutely inappropriate to consider putting someone in prison for such a breach of the act. Prison, according to accepted government policy, is a punishment of last resort. I am putting the government on notice that I will use every opportunity to put amendments to such provisions in this and other legislation. Also, something that will be raised in the committee stage of this debate is a recognition that women suffer imprisonment for social security infringements beyond all proportion in relation to their share of the social security measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends that section of the act relating to the treatment of shares and other securities held by social security recipients. This section falls within one or other of the `oops' categories that I mentioned earlier. It is significant that these amendments are being introduced with so little fanfare as the provisions as they currently stand in the act were given enormous publicity both by the government and by those who opposed them. Regrettably, the proposed change does not go far enough and it is my intention to circulate an amendment at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the move by the government to ensure that people are not kept from their entitlements to social security payments because of a time lag between amendments to the Migration Act and consequential amendments to the Social Security Act. However, it must be said that this situation would not arise if there was not so much tinkering with the legislation going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to pension age for women, I heartily endorse Senator Lees's earlier comments on this issue. I simply wish to add that the Greens will be opposing the measure to raise the pension age for women to 65 years over a period of some 20 years because it will have an adverse impact on women at the point in their lives when they are arguably economically most vulnerable and because the change makes no sense at a time when the effective retirement age for men must be coming down due to the vast numbers of forced and voluntary redundancies being experienced in all sectors of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I speak about tax file numbers. The bill also provided the government with a legislative opportunity to respond to John Malloch's tax file number case. We notice that this has resulted in the redrafting of a portion of the act. While I can understand the desire of the government to close the loophole which came to light in Mr Malloch's case, the response contains something of an overreaction, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claimant and the claimant's partner can be requested, to use the careful terminology of the most recent amendment circulated by the minister, to provide their tax file numbers twice&mdash;once at the point of making the claim and once when the claim has been decided and they move into the category of being recipients. It has been put to me that the department would not ask twice so it is nothing to worry about, but there are in fact two issues of concern here. The first is that if the department does not intend to ask twice, why give it the power to do so? It simply invites placing additional burdens on people. Surely it is sufficient to have the power to request the number to be given once and once only, whether that be at claim point or recipient point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the whole matter of the tax file number becoming more and more an identifier, an issue I notice the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills mentioned. This was not the announced intention behind the tax file number when the concept of its broader use was introduced in 1988. If the government wants to make it a universal identifier, it should do so openly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner has also commented on this provision. His advice resulted in the amendments circulated, as I mentioned. We are now in a situation where the Privacy Commissioner has objected to the degree of compulsion expressed in the original form of the bill but has allowed that if a person is requested to provide a tax file number then all will be well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, some absurd logic behind this notion of non-compulsion. A person can refuse to provide a tax file number, but that person will not get the benefit or pension. A person is free to refuse at the expense of livelihood. Of course, we have already had this logic in other aspects of government. It is the same argument the government uses when speaking about the asylum seekers in Port Hedland: `They are not being detained against their will because they can leave at any time they like, as long as they withdraw their application for refugee status and accept being sent back to the country they fled from.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind honourable senators of the rights and freedoms we were promised by the government when it extended the tax file number system after the Australia card misadventure. We were told that the tax file number would not become a universal identifier, that providing one would be voluntary when dealing with institutions, especially governments and so on. We were told that if we were involved in a financial relationship, such as holding a bank account, we could not be compelled to provide a tax file number, as long as we were prepared to have tax withheld at source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have certainly moved a long way since then. If only people who applied for social security benefits could have such an option. But, no. They are told: `Hand over the number or give up your benefit.' But we should not be too surprised by this development. After all, the Department of Social Security has the same attitude towards the method of payment people must accept. They either have a bank account or they do not get their benefit. Of course, there is some twisted logic which says that it is not compulsory. After all, they can always decide not to apply for a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to use the tax file number as a universal identifier, then I think the Australian people should be told about it. However, if the aim is to have the tax file number as an identifier only for social security recipients, then the government should be condemned for treating that group in the community as untrustworthy or as somehow people to be put under surveillance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the family payments rate calculator. Lastly, we have a good news item in the bill. The adjustment to the family payments rate calculator is welcome as a fulfilment of a budget commitment made last year. I believe I have made clear those issues in the bill with which we have difficulties and have indicated to the government where we would like to see changes made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 will replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 to enable plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they develop. Plant breeders' rights were extensively discussed between 1981 and 1986, concluding with an exhaustive inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources. The committee recommended that a plant variety rights scheme be established in line with the 1987 Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, generally referred to as UPOV, and that Australia accede to that convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the 1987 legislation Australia had not been able to keep up with the latest varieties in a host of areas, particularly in horticulture. This was because breeders' rights were not protected in Australia and therefore they were not prepared to allow their varieties to come to Australia. The reason for rewriting and renaming the legislation is principally to conform to the 1991 revision of the UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name change from `Plant Variety Rights' to `Plant Breeder's Rights' is in line with the convention and common usage internationally. The new legislation is expected to provide a greater stimulus to innovation than the 1987 act by encouraging increased investment in plant breeding and technology transfer. This is needed to maintain Australia's access to new plant varieties as a result of work carried out either in Australia or overseas. Grain growers are particularly concerned about the need for new varieties to improve protein levels. State government breeding programs have been cut back and there is a need to stimulate plant breeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, with certain defined exemptions and extensions, provides exclusive right to the following acts of exploitation of the propagating material of new varieties: production or reproduction of the material; conditioning the material for the purpose of propagation; offering the material for sale; selling the material; importing the material; exporting the material; and stocking the material for any of the above reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the extension of the right to include essentially derived and certain dependent varieties and prescribes the actions that may be taken to have a variety declared essentially derived. A plant variety is taken to be an essentially derived variety of another plant variety if it is predominantly derived from that other plant variety; it retains the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of that other variety; and it does not exhibit any important, as distinct from cosmetic, features that differentiate it from that other variety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill extends the breeder's right to the harvested material where the plant was propagated without authorisation but only if the grantee of the right has not had a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to the propagating material. Public interest provisions in the bill allow exemptions to the exclusive right to propagate material when acts are done by any person privately and for non-commercial purposes, for bona fide experimental and research purposes and for the purpose of breeding other plant varieties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill extends the immorality and unethical behaviour which has marked the passage of a number of bills through this parliament in relation to the ownership, the commercial exploitation and the exclusive use for commercial purposes of genetic material. I cannot put it more strongly than that. I think all legislation of this sort is totally immoral and should not pass through this parliament. We saw this occur with the plant variety rights legislation and with the patent bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will recall that over a considerable time I argued that the ownership of DNA, the ownership of genes and the ownership of life forms for commercial purposes and commercial exploitation is morally and totally indefensible. That is still the position that the Australian Democrats take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some senators may have seen the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program last night. It did not deal with the ethical questions but dealt instead with some of the problems that arise as a consequence of the patenting of life forms which, incidentally, would be covered by this legislation. This legislation extends the coverage from plants to viruses and this is something which we will seek to amend later. The program last night dealt with the patenting by an American company of the virus responsible for hepatitis C. According to the program, the patenting extended so widely that it covered not only the virus but also the preparation of various immune testing devices&mdash;the ability to test for hepatitis C, the ability to identify hepatitis C, the ability to prepare vaccines and so on. Evidently, an Australian company is now attempting to challenge that patent because it has developed a more effective way of identifying the presence of this virus in human blood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If senators saw the program they would know that two patent attorneys were arguing about the technicalities of this matter. Lying behind this discussion was the spectre of, for instance, the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital being inhibited from researching in this very important area because those who might provide the finance for this research were concerned that if they produced a useful result that useful result would actually be owned by an American company. There is a direct impediment to research into a very important human disease because of the exclusive ownership of genetic information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill and the other acts to which I have referred fail to take account of one of the most fundamental discoveries of the last 41 years in relation to genetics and that is that the genetic code which describes the information by which every living creature determines its structure, its proteins, its biochemistry is exactly the same whether it is for a virus, a plant or a human being. Under those circumstances, and as we now know, it is not possible to identify a gene as a human gene, a viral gene or a bacterial gene. Those genes can be taken from any species and put into any other species. That is exactly what has been happening. Under this legislation it is quite possible that a human gene could be generated in a plant for various purposes and that that hybrid creature would be protected for commercial purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to argue that human genes should be uniquely protected. My argument is that all genetic material needs to be uniquely protected from this commercial ownership and exploitation. There is no difference between human genetic material and genetic material from any other source. That is precisely the basis of the charge that I make that legislation of this sort is unethical and immoral and, therefore, should not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of very practical consequences which flow from this legislation and I have mentioned just one of those. The secrecy which surrounds exclusive ownership for proprietorial reasons is directly inhibitory to research, much of which may be in the interests of human beings or in the broader interests of preserving biological diversity. I will get onto that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no basis to the argument that is often put that it is only by patenting, or by giving those who work with particular species exclusive rights, that research work will be advanced. If that were so then research work would have begun just in the last decade or so. It is only in the last decade or so that we have taken this rather peculiar attitude towards science that only that science which is paid for is the science which will be done. The fact remains that science has gone on for many hundreds of years. It has gone on in the public interest and scientific knowledge has been generally available to everybody. That is inhibited by this process of giving people exclusive commercial rights. That process which we have embarked upon is very likely to lead to the progressive strangulation of science itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very often the discoveries with respect to one species are applicable to another. The discoveries and knowledge of manipulating plant genes are applicable to the manipulation of human genes and applicable to how human genes operate. That inhibition of the progress of science in those areas is directly damaging not only to science itself but also to human progress and the understanding of our own make-up and our own diseases and how we deal with them and cure them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that research work will be progressed only if there is a commercial interest in it denies the very basis which guides most scientists. I have worked at the laboratory bench for over 20 years and I know that I was not guided by profits at the end of what I did. I was guided by an interest in the work that I was doing. </PARA>

If we look at the papers that people have published&mdash;more particularly, if we look at the science citation index, which lists the number of times other scientists refer to the work that one has published&mdash;we get a direct measure of the value of that work. That clearly is adding to the totality of human knowledge on which all the applications of that science are built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact also is that, irrespective of whether the research is paid for by private companies or by `government' out of taxation, it is money which comes from the community. It comes through private sources because the private companies are able to charge more than the value of the production of whatever it is they sell. That, in a sense, `private taxation' then is ploughed back into research. But the money comes from the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if the research is paid for by way of government funded research work in universities or in CSIRO&mdash;although there are decreasing amounts going to CSIRO, since the government is cutting its funding&mdash;the money still comes from the community, and the results should go back to the community. They should be in the public domain as public information, publicly paid for, publicly owned, publicly available and for the benefit of the public broadly. That is really what science should be about. The point I am making is that this legislation, along with several other pieces of legislation that we have passed through this place, is undermining in a very fundamental way the progress of science itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already attempted to take up two other aspects of this legislation and have them referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs because, in my view, there is serious doubt as to whether this piece of legislation falls foul of various undertakings which this government has entered into by way of the native title legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is simply that the native title legislation says that the only way a native title can be undone is within the terms of that legislation itself. In my view, a good case has been put&mdash;although the Senate clearly is not accepting this&mdash;that this legislation may well undermine, and therefore deny, native title. I am simply making the point that in my view and in the view of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills legal advice there was substance to that argument. I think there is danger in passing legislation which may be in conflict with legislation which has already been passed. Linked with that is the danger associated with the international convention on biodiversity, which is also a legal requirement that has been placed by this government on itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling dealt with a couple of other aspects of this legislation, some of the more technical details of which I would like to pick up. One of them is to do with the rights of farmers to retain seed on their farm. When we get to the committee stage of this legislation we will be moving an amendment to remove from the legislation the serious potential impediments which we see to farmers retaining that right. We believe that farmers being able to retain seed from previous crops for the planting of the current crop is a time-honoured tradition and that that should not be tampered with in any way. To place the demands of those who claim these plant breeder's rights above the right of the farmer who is actually producing food and fibre for the nation seems to me to be going down an extremely dangerous road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked with that, another danger that one sees is the gradual narrowing of the genetic base of the crops which we grow. It seems to me that herein lies another very considerable danger of this legislation. Once the exclusive ownership of the plant base of our agricultural production extends to only a few companies&mdash;and I believe it will become a monopoly or an oligopoly situation very rapidly&mdash;we are very much in danger of that genetic base being manipulated in such a way that it becomes narrower and narrower. We are very much in danger then of losing the variability to modify our crops as we need to, as the environment itself changes over time, particularly with respect to plant diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been extremely well served&mdash;I hope Senator Brownhill will agree with me&mdash;over many decades by organisations such as the CSIRO and the Waite Institute in South Australia carrying out research on various crop varieties and producing the varieties of wheat, barley, maize, cotton and so on which Australian farmers need. This research was in the public domain: it was publicly paid for; the information was publicly available; and the seeds and products of that research were easily and without great expense made available to the farmers of Australia. I believe that is the way that this process should continue. I do not believe that the process of giving these rights exclusively to individuals, which in my view will rapidly become monopoly ownership and oligopoly ownership, is the way we will produce any better varieties, or any more varieties, or any cheaper varieties, than we have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked with this is the fact that many of these monopolies and oligopolies will also be the large agribusiness companies that also produce agricultural chemicals. It is quite conceivable that, rather than develop a strain of wheat which is resistant to a particular disease, these companies may develop strains of wheat which can be made more tolerant of, say, higher doses of pesticides which are made by particular companies as a way of controlling weed infestation in those crops. That way, companies get a double bonus. Not only do they sell the seed for the crop, but they can also then sell the pesticide&mdash;the chemical which goes on to kill the competing weeds. </PARA>

I think we have enough information in relation to the behaviour of these large companies to know that they are very much motivated by maximising profit and that they will direct their research in ways which are not necessarily in the best interests of the public but in the best interests of maximising their profit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few things on which I agree with Senator Coulter, especially on the good work that the CSIRO has done in breeding new varieties of wheat. I do not know whether Senator Coulter mentioned Roseworthy College, but what it has produced has been a great boon for the wheat growers of Western Australia. It showed the way for the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia, which has been rather blinkered for many years, for producing new varieties. I certainly do not agree with Senator Coulter's conspiracy theory, but no doubt we will argue that at another time in another place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to declare my interest in the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill because of the vast `interest' I have in the agricultural industry, particularly the wheat industry. My family and I, along with other wheat farmers, benefit from the research done by plant breeders around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill has already been pointed out. It proposes to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The main difference is the scope and strength of the new proprietary rights&mdash;obviously Senator Coulter does not agree with PBRs&mdash;extending the duration of breeders' rights to 25 years in the case of trees and vines and 20 years for any other variety. We must remember that when we come to wheat and barley, and probably triticale&mdash;the first two more than the last&mdash;we seldom have a plant variety that lasts 20 years. It has been a mighty long time since any wheat varieties lasted anywhere near that time, but we have the derivatives to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for an extension of the PBR to include import and export of propagated material, an extension that includes harvested material in certain circumstances and an extension to include essentially derived and certain dependent ventures, which are part of what I mentioned earlier. There are also increased penalties, which is probably the mainstay of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill is very important in encouraging an increase in expenditure in research stations, such as the CSIRO, various departments of agriculture around Australia and some other private ones. Expenditure or funding for these stations seems to be ever decreasing, as has happened in the CSIRO. It is therefore important to have a bill that encourages more money to go into plant research so that those who do the work are rewarded, contrary to what Senator Coulter said. That is very important in the coming years. Speaking of the CSIRO, it is very important to make sure that we remain at least abreast, if not in front, of our competitors in world trade. I believe this bill should be supported by all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct my remarks in the main to the effects on the wheat industry of Australia. This legislation has come at a very opportune time because, as honourable senators may have read, the Australian Wheat Board is making a big push forward to lift the protein level of wheat in Australia because, unfortunately, it has dropped rather dramatically in the last 10-odd years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for that are wide and varied, but it has happened. Honourable senators have probably heard of the Wheat Board's new program called 2x10x2000. For those who do not understand that term, it means two tonne of hectare at 10 per cent protein by the year 2000. We have quite a long way to go because the average protein level in Australia is presently below nine per cent. If we could get an average of two tonne a hectare by the year 2000, that would suit me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are other reasons for the drop in protein. Probably not many eastern state farmers would believe this at present, but there seems to have been a higher than average rainfall in the wheat growing areas for the last five, six, seven or eight years&mdash;in other words, since the last major drought of the eastern states. Of course, higher rainfall tends to lower the protein while giving higher yields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another possible reason is that not enough nitrogenous fertiliser has been applied because the price of it has risen quite a bit in the last five or six years. The downturn in wool has led to the topdressing going down. The application of broadcasting super, whether one is growing crop or not&mdash;super means fertiliser&mdash;could have a bearing, as could the government's mismanagement of the economy and the effect on the farming balance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With such an important bill, I thought the government would have had an A-grader in the chamber rather than a B-grader. If Senator Sherry hangs around long enough, he might arrive there. New varieties are needed to get the protein level up so that we can compete in the world markets, especially with the noodle wheat and other higher protein wheats that are in great demand at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this bill but that does not mean that I cannot question some parts of the bill&mdash;perhaps a bit more thoroughly than some of my colleagues and the National Farmers Federation. The first clause of the bill that I would like to address is that dealing with public interest exemptions for farm-saved-seed. The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs refers to this and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . clause 17 contains an exemption to the PBR, namely the farmers' privilege or farm-saved seed exemption. This permits a farmer to save seed from a crop to plant a future crop&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `to plant a future crop'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the farmers' own land, without infringing PBR.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Coulter mentioned, it continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, under subclause 17(2), "regulations may declare a particular taxon to be a taxon" to which the principle of farm-saved-seed does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a few points that worry me about that. I could probably take them up in more detail in the committee stage, but I want an explanation of how that is going to work. With the farm-saved-seed, people save the seed that they have harvested from plants grown from a registered seed bought from a breeder or from a farmer who has bulked up the new seed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, when pedigree seed or a new variety is sold to a farmer, the farmer is issued with a certificate stating that he has bought it. I have asked, when there are two farmers in partnership, whether they get only one certificate and, if so, whether it covers both partners, whether it covers the farm or what the situation is. Similarly, where there are three or four farmers in partnership, do all of the farmers have to have a certificate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there is the sharefarmer situation. There are various ways of sharefarming. The farmer can harvest the seed himself and put it in silos. A sharefarmer can be brought in. He may put in the crop by way of a joint situation. What happens when it is delivered? Can the sharefarmer deliver wheat in his name using the certificate of the original farmer? Can he do that? I have not been told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other situations, too. The farmer may simply own the ground and a sharefarmer can come in, bringing his own seed. Can the sharefarmer use the original farmer's certificate or not? The report also says, with regard to farmer's privilege, as I read earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This permits a farmer to save seed from a crop to plant a future crop on the farmers' own land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is he saving the seed from his own land? Is that farmer able to use it on a property that he has leased or a property that he is sharefarming? Nobody has told me that, either. The report also says, and I repeat, `to seed another crop'. What about the farmer's own food? If he wants to get his wheat milled on his own property, can he use it? The other question relates to stockfeed. I know that one is allowed to do a certain amount of things with that sort of seed, but are farmers allowed to downstream their own stockfeed to use on their own properties? There are far too many of these questions that are not answered. They are the fears that I have got in this regard. I will need a lot more answers to these sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Philip Davies gave evidence to the committee. He raised quite a few questions, as the representative from the United Scientists for Environmental Responsibility and Protection. He was not very happy about clause 17(2). Clause 17(2) states that the regulations may declare a particular taxon to be a taxon to which the principle of farm-saved seed does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have my own conspiracy theory in this regard. It means that anyone, at any time, may be able to control the varieties grown in Australia by applying to the minister. Clause 17(2) of the bill, which may be subject to amendment, may enable anyone to apply to have certain varieties withdrawn from certain areas. That might be my idea of a conspiracy theory, but I am very frightened that it might happen. Concerns were raised by Dr Davies in relation to clause 17(2). I will quote what he said in full, in order to better understand the situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Subclause 17(2)] provides an option for certain commodity producers to approach the Minister to request the Minister to declare by regulation that that particular commodity be excluded from the farm-saved-seed provision.</PARA>
<PARA>So the minister gets an application. It does not actually say that the minister has to take any notice. I give the example of the Australian Wheat Board, which sells all wheat overseas. It has a monopoly, and I believe that it should keep that monopoly to sell to the export market. In particular areas, it could get particular strains taken out, by making application. The minister does not necessarily have to take notice, because the minister can `possibly' consult&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would consult with possibly the Grains Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not that I am too frightened about what the Grains Council might say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or the commodity group, before it could recommend that the Minister make regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister wants to listen to one particular group, he can have all the consultations on earth, but he does not necessarily have to take any notice. I have strong fears about that. I believe that that clause should be strengthened. I do not know whether clause 17(2) should be eliminated altogether, as Senator Coulter said. It may serve a purpose in regard to trees, vines or whatever. But with regard to the wheat industry, I am very concerned as to what may result from it. Of course, Dr Davies did not accept that the bill provided enough safeguards. The committee recommended that the Senate agree to the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, with the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that public notices should be given</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)where an exemption pursuant to subclause 17(2) is being considered by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what does that really do? No doubt it alerts growers, but as I have already said, it does not confirm any rights. The minister need not take any notice of their concerns. Having drawn those rather depressing conclusions, I certainly support the bill for the reasons I have outlined. We must ensure that funds continue to go into research, especially in regard to new plant varieties. The same applies in regard to trees and vines. I am certainly interested to see the horticulture and wine industry progress. As I say, my main concern is with the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to have an inquiry into funding by the CSIRO for research into rural products. We must ensure that funds flow into these organisations. We must also ensure that these organisations retain the services of our top scientists. I am not necessarily talking about the CSIRO. That will be the subject of debate on another day. I do want to see it keep its top research scientists. The same applies to the departments of agriculture and other private organisations in Australia. I am very interested to see that we keep these research people in Australia.

<PARA>the supporters of plant breeder's rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have for establishing those rights. For instance, if you claim rights, in most instances in human society, then you need either an ethical starting point or a convention&mdash;for instance, the United Nations convention on human rights&mdash;that establishes universally agreed rights in a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I listen, I find it hard to find a starting point. As I read the letters and submissions from industry, I can understand that the legislation answers all of the needs that industry has, but that really does not establish the right of industry to make that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old scientific claim that was often proffered, that if it can be done then it should be done, is also for me unacceptable as an ethical starting point. One of the comments made this morning was you cannot put a dollar value on the increased production provided by plant variety rights. For me that is not an adequate ethical starting point, either. For me to support plant variety rights I need to get some understanding of how you arrive at a claim, or how you can establish what a farmer's or a breeder's right is over living things.</PARA>
<PARA>I need, therefore, to state my own starting point, an ethical and a theological starting point. One of the claims made by many people in this place is the claim to be Christian. But what does that claim mean? I reject the claim of a Christian, ethical or theological starting point if it means an exclusive claim to be the only truth. In a pluralistic society it is more critical to make these sorts of claims as one starting point amongst many&mdash;a claim which deserves to be heard in this forum as in other forums but not an exclusive claim to be the only truth. So it is that I need to explain what I believe a theological or ethical analysis of plant breeding rights would look like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, if it is a theological analysis, there needs to be a divine starting point. That starting point is that God is lord of everything in the universe. In that kind of universe, human beings at best can only claim a limited ownership of things&mdash;and even that has its limits&mdash;but not of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting to it. I would like Senator Boswell to be patient. The only ownership that human beings can claim over life must always be one of stewardship rather than an absolute and exclusive ownership. This is a fundamental principle. If one accepts the idea of creation&mdash;particularly that explained in the biblical book of Genesis&mdash;then one needs to enter the debate about the meaning of such passages as Genesis 1:28 in which human beings are given rule or dominion over all living things. That can never be interpreted as domination and can only be seen as `to be responsible for'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after human disobedience and sin that the rule of human beings over all living things turned in any sense into domination. The act of creation is described in the first two chapters of Genesis, which contains the passage about ruling and having dominion over. In the descriptions in the two stories of creation there are a number of instances, in fact the whole of the two stories, which underline that the rule of human beings is to be seen only in terms of stewardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we read the first chapter, we will see that a circle of relationships is established in which each living thing and the earth itself are seen to be in relationship to every other living thing, and each stage in the creation is declared to be very good. So, in other words, the creation is not something to be despised or exploited or dominated, but something which God declares to be given and to be very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is established an interdependence. This is established in a number of ways: in the naming of the animals which, in Hebrew understanding, really meant that the person naming the animals was thereby made responsible for them; in the way in which Adam and Eve are seen to be in a complementary situation, not one superior to the other but rather only as a unit as they complement one another; and in the way in which the earth is said to bring forth all living things. The word for `to bring forth' is really the word `birth'. In other words, the earth is seen to be the mother of all living things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator McGauran not to be ridiculous, please. The interdependence of all living things is established. I can answer Senator McGauran about abortion on another occasion. It is only after human sin and disobedience that domination becomes the paradigm for the human relationship to living things. The domination of the human over earth and plants is seen as a struggle; the human domination over animals and the ability to deliver death to animals is seen as part of human domination; the domination of man over woman and the domination of sibling over sibling all become part of human disobedience, the ability of human beings to dominate living things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in this context that we need to understand any claim to ownership of life, any claim that human beings can in any exclusive sense own other living things. In the creation, the establishment by God is of a relationship of stewardship. We are responsible for living things. It is only in terms of human disobedience that human beings claim a right to own or dominate living things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read to honourable senators from an ethicist for whom I have great respect, the late Professor Roly Busch. In a document which he produced some years ago he wrote words which I think we need to hear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we need an evaluation of the new technology which presents us with two faces, one that is full of hope and promise for humankind, and another that is full of threat. For technology is two edged&mdash;it may humanise and improve; or it may dehumanise and destroy. We need some common agreement about the extent to which nature, both human and non-human, can and should be manipulated and controlled. Where are we to draw the line?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot inhibit scientific research without denying to humankind the blessings of God's creation as yet unknown or untapped. For God is experienced within the processes of nature as well as through the history of mankind. In the ongoing unfolding purposes of creation He continues to reveal Himself to His world and to His creatures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Humankind has the capacity to disobey God's will and to thwart His purposes. The world in which we live often rebels against the will and purposes of God. Scientists no less than the rest of us act from mixed motives. Compassion and the desire to heal, the thirst for knowledge, recognition or fame, financial incentive, even power over the powerless, all contribute to the confusion of motives that prompt research into reproductive and other . . . technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This dual relationship to God as Lord of History and Sustainer of the creative process gives human beings both their freedom and their responsibility. As christians understand it, participation in creation requires that they conform to a given "order" of process and change which adheres to established rules and principles. Recognising their relationship to God in creation and history, they are to act creatively in accordance with their knowledge of God and their knowledge of the world which He created and still sustains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we who live in a pluralistic and multicultural society cannot expect governments to legislate in ways that preserve only the insights, needs and rights of christians. There is no absolute right to rights. Those of other religious persuasions or none have their rights also.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why I have said that this framework which I want to establish is one amongst others that need to be considered. There is the framework, for example, in which the respect for all living things, which needs no divine starting point, is also worthy of our consideration. Even for those who do not accept divine origins for created life, the same principles apply. Respect for all living things means that all forms of life have value for their own sake, not because they are in any sense owned or to be given worth only as a commodity to be traded and given a dollar value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to return to the starting point, which I believe was put by those who supported plant breeders rights when I asked the question of them: what is your ethical starting point? There seemed to be three starting points. The first was the right to protect the profits of those who developed particular plant varieties; the second was the right to ownership of product development; and the third was the need to develop new forms of plants to feed the expanding world population. Even though I do not agree with all Dr Lloyd's assumptions, I think he answered very well the question that I asked him. It will be worth putting on the record some of the things he said. In answer he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it has been established for well over a hundred years now that there is some right for innovators who invest their time and intellect in innovation to get a return&mdash;some reward or some encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA>I think plant breeders rights are no more than that. A breeder makes an intellectual and financial investment in innovation. Dr Lloyd also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of plant breeders rights is to encourage innovation so that man is assured of new, better quality, sustained food production for the benefit of mankind.</PARA>
<PARA>So it seems to me that Dr Lloyd and other witnesses established three starting points. But I believe that none of these are adequate, for a number of reasons. I do not negate the value of people receiving profits for the work that they do; there is no problem with that. But profits need to follow ethics. They are not a starting point; they do not give an ethical framework to establish plant breeders' rights. Although product development is a worthy goal and those who develop intellectual or other products need to have protection, I do not agree that simply developing a product is a sufficient reason to give that person exclusive and unlimited rights over that product for an unspecified time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that we need to develop these seeds for the benefit of humankind is certainly a very worthy ethical starting point, but I wonder whether Dr Lloyd was not saying that with tongue in cheek a little. The problem in feeding the people in this world who need to be fed today is not whether we can produce enough food to feed them. That is not the problem. Throughout the world we have vast stockpiles of food. The problem is that we are unable to deliver that food to the people who need the food. And the problem is not whether we have sufficient development of particular seeds to enable sufficient amounts of food to be produced; the problem is the financial system which puts a block in the way of delivering food to those who need it. I would suggest that that is the biggest problem that we have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite hard to follow Senator Woodley's philosophical argument, although I take nothing away from the way he put it. It is his bent to put it in the manner he put it. But I do believe that a starting point for this Plant Breeder's Rights Bill is the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That is where this debate starts, and it is a little more in the present than some of the things Senator Woodley was talking about. Whether we cast our seeds onto barren or fertile land, we definitely have to have plant breeders' rights to make sure that we get all those better varieties and the things that will come with this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I declare my interest as a wheat grower and also as a cooperator with the University of Sydney in the north-west Wheat Research Institute. At this stage I pay tribute to all those wonderful breeders of wheat, sorghum, sunflowers, fava beans and all the other crops that we grow on our properties when, God willing, we get the rain and the seasons to bring forth the harvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to Senator Coulter's speech. I could not really understand what he was trying to say about trying to stall this bill, which I think basically is what it is all about. This bill is about protecting the breeder of a variety so that breeders have a chance to recoup some of the money expended on the production of a variety. I think it is very important, because to produce a variety costs a lot of money and a lot of effort. Earlier I thought Senator Coulter was talking about pure science because all he was going to do was produce papers. This is about more than producing papers; this is about producing better varieties of crops and better varieties of plants for future use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, this Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, it should be noted here, is consistent with Australia's obligations under UPOV, the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. It is also in harmony with United Nations Agenda 21&mdash;I know the Australian Democrats are very happy to talk about United Nations agendas and that sort of thing&mdash;the international Convention on Biological Diversity, the FAO undertaking on plant genetic resources, and also with GATT. That has a lot to do with why this bill is here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my desire to delay the Senate for very long. I will be reasonably quick with my remarks. Essentially this bill is a name change for the previous act, the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987, which enabled Australian breeders to apply for and receive patent rights for new varieties of plants that they developed. It will also provide greater incentives for investment in plant breeding which is to the benefit of Australian agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original legislation had a long and hotly argued history, and I think we should turn to that. PVR was a controversial issue at the time, and was a source of many parliamentary and departmental reports during the 1980s. In 1984 the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources brought down its findings on the issue after a two-year study. The committee received over 200 submissions and held a number of public meetings at which over 70 witnesses gave evidence. Senators Boswell, Crichton-Browne and Zakharov are the only senators left who were on the original committee, but I am sure they can attest to the passion&mdash;I am sure Senator Boswell will later in the debate&mdash;with which many witnesses argued their points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the committee charged with examining the bill this time around, I can attest to that passion. I think some of it was a little inflamed by some of my colleagues on my left here, the Democrats. The issues that the 1984 committee looked at ranged from the impact of PVR on public breeding programs to effects on Third World countries. Many suggested that PVR would be a means of justifying a reduction in government expenditure on public breeding, which I think Senator Coulter has alluded to; a shift from practical plant breeding into pure research; a consequent separation of basic research and teaching from plant breeding; and a diminution in cooperation between public and private breeders. Basically, I think that is the argument Senator Coulter was trying to put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1984 committee concluded that PVR was a desirable development for Australia, although there was a dissenting report from Senator Georges and Senator Zakharov. In addition to the Senate committee report, the then minister for primary industry commissioned Professor Alec Lazenby to undertake a study into Australia's plant breeding needs. He concluded that the benefits of PVR, as it was then, far outweighed any perceived disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own experience in the intervening years, the benefits that Lazenby alluded to have indeed come to fruition. Since the introduction of plant breeders' rights, or plant variety rights as it was previously called, Australian farmers have been able to access new varieties across a range of crops, for which we are very thankful. For Australian gardeners the explosion in ornamentals has been no less dramatic, and we can see it all around us. That is why the legislation before us today&mdash;as was the case with the previous legislation&mdash;has the support of all the major players in rural industry: the National Farmers Federation; the Grains Council of Australia; the Seed Industry Association; and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, among others. All these groups have advised their support for the legislation, with the only suggestion being a toughening of the penalties applicable to any company which deliberately infringes a breeder's right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, as we know, the Senate sent the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for inquiry. Fortunately, we have been a little speedier than the 1984 committee; we got on with the job. I believe the conclusions are approximately the same as those of the previous committee. The rural and regional affairs committee took evidence from a wide range of sources, from the Grains Council to individuals such as Professor Godden from the Sydney University department of agricultural economics. We heard very similar arguments to those raised in the 1980s, and we have dismissed most of those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I note that in a formal response to the committee, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy suggested that the `groundswell of opposition' referred to by various witnesses boiled down to arguments lodged originally by one or two people and fanned around by various limited vision interest groups, among them Aboriginal groups which suggested that the legislation contravened land rights. The evidence we had and the advice we got from the government and from other legal sources was that this was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee has recommended minor amendments to two areas of the bill&mdash;17(2) and 22(3)&mdash;to provide transparency to the minister's powers, the majority of the committee is of the view that the legislation is beneficial to Australia and should get the support of the Senate. But this is not just the committee's view. The Grains Council of Australia, representing grain growers in Australia&mdash;and as such has particular expertise in and understanding of the needs of the industry&mdash;also supports it. I gave my pecuniary interest earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see a representative from the Grains Council, James Price, in the gallery here tonight watching this legislation being debated. The Council is of the view that the legislation is sound and that PBR is vital to the grain industry. It has advised me that the amendments that the rural and regional affairs committee has proposed would serve to give written confirmation to something verbally presumed and would generally be of great benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that history obviously repeats itself because we had a dissenting report from Senator Woodley and the Democrats. The Democrats are well-known for trying to stall this legislation by sending it off to another Senate committee to provide yet another forum for their supporters to air their limited views. That came through tonight. Obviously they are trying to stall the legislation. This chamber should not let that happen in any shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say as an aside that if the Democrats wish to have any credibility in the bush they need to stop listening to the fringe dwellers they attract and start listening to people in the real world. That is what they are doing; they are listening to the fringe dwellers and not getting on with the job of doing something that is of benefit, not only to our country but also to trade, making sure that we are in unison with the rest of the world. Australia is a part of the modern world. We are not an isolated little place where the fairies live down the bottom of the garden. We are a part of the real world. The Democrats have to start believing that, if they are going to believe in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation ensures that Australia is and will continue to remain competitive, that we remain responsive to industry needs and receptive to changes in technology. There is much more I would like to say in reference to evidence taken by the committee but time prevents me from doing so tonight because my urge is that we get on with this debate and make sure that the legislation is operative on 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation. The rural industry supports it. The legislation is good. I am pleased that this matter is now to be resolved and off the Senate agenda. I hope that we do it in a quick and forthright manner so that we can get on with making sure that Australia remains at the forefront of producing new varieties, and is able to use new varieties from around the world and perfect the variety that is produced by the breeder, wherever he is.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these amendments are necessary for Australia to become involved in importing and exporting our produce.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular point I want to touch on&mdash;the committee of which I was a member dealt with this&mdash;is the great reservation I had when looking at the bill about the satisfactory nature of the saved seed requirements. I am sure the word `taxon' confused everybody on the committee&mdash;it certainly confused me and it confused a lot of the witnesses. Until I was able to work out what the word `taxon' meant and had the definition put in place, I was of the opinion that `taxon' meant a particular variety of grain. For example, to the wheat industry, which Senator Panizza raised earlier on, it actually means a total species of wheat, not a variety within it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could see restrictions coming in whereby a particular variety could be excluded for individual commercial advantage. The purpose of this particular amendment, however, is not to give an individual a commercial advantage. If a particular industry or group of people&mdash;the cotton industry has been referred to as one possibility&mdash;has a necessity for a fresh source of seed every year to maintain quality, that could be a useful mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that additional procedures be put in place to give people notification. If consideration was being given to the declaration of a particular taxon under clause 17(2), I suggest that would not happen unless there was very wide industry support for any particular minister to utilise clause 17(2) of the bill. As such, and with those additional requirements, I came to the conclusion, as did the majority of the committee, that the safeguards for that particular aspect of the legislation were satisfactory. I would suggest that if any minister moved against the will of an industry in applying that declaration, it would be tantamount to declaring war on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two other points about the evidence that I want to raise in the time I have available to me. There is no doubt that there is a degree of conflict between those who prefer public funding for research and those who prefer private funding. In my view there is no reason whatsoever for that conflict. Public and private funding for research are totally compatible with one another and, in fact, complement each other very well. They even provide a competitive edge, creating a situation where we get better results from both arms of the research effort in developing new varieties that improve our productive capacities, improve quality, and, as I earlier mentioned, have regard to conservation. So to argue for one particular form of research or development against the other is taking a very narrow and selective view of what happens in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were developed in that way&mdash;I do not believe it will be&mdash;it would put Australian producers at a significant disadvantage in relation to the rest of the world. I again emphasise that currently Australia leads the world in much of this area. I mentioned the seeds that were imported from Portugal but, in fact, we export a fair degree of our research and development in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other thing I wanted to touch on with respect to the evidence that was given to us at the hearings. I made the point when the report was tabled that it is important that this legislation proceed and not be delayed unnecessarily because of the native title legislation. It is my view that submission we received on this point was based on very thin and, dare I say it, spurious grounds. It was an attempt to delay legislation on what I believe was a totally false premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If using the native title legislation to delay the proper passage of legislation through this place is going to become a pattern, we should take every opportunity to make it quite clear&mdash;whether we are serving on a committee, speaking in this place or in the public arena&mdash;that we are not going to allow other legislation to be delayed because of that particular legislation to the disadvantage of all Australians&mdash;not just the people in the industry, but also Aboriginal people.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This document, by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal L. B. Fisher, is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on DCAS investigation into allegations against US pilots during Exercise Southern Frontier</EMPHASIS>. I am very pleased with the acknowledgment by Defence in this investigation of the need for a two-way flow of information between the government and the Department of Defence, and the community that is affected by military exercises, in this case with regard to military exercises involving aircraft and noise abatement procedures, particularly in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very vexed question in Darwin and northern Australia for some months now. The particular exercise that is referred to in this report was ongoing from February to May and involved the United States marine corps operating a very substantial number of personnel and aircraft in Darwin. In fact, I believe there were 400 marines operating in Darwin at the height of this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues arose because noise abatement is really a town planning issue in any community and when there is a large number of aircraft the impact of noise abatement has to be acknowledged. This report highlights a number of incidents in which the guidelines were broken or frustrated. The Department of Defence has acknowledged that and has set out a number of procedures that are very important to mitigate and correct that situation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there has been no camouflage or any attempt in any way to hide any of the problems that have arisen. Several incidents needed corrective action by Defence mechanisms as did the very general problem of the noise abatement procedures that must be adopted in an important community such as Darwin. The report acknowledges this and gives a series of recommendations that are very important for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is an important acknowledgment of the role that the defence department must play in making information available to the community.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the anticipated economic and social advantages to the Northern Territory community by continuing air exercises and other associated activities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it should be noted that the advantages for the Northern Territory community&mdash;and for all Australians&mdash;from continuing air exercises with foreign forces relate primarily to enhancing ADF capabilities to defend Australia and to promoting regional security. Exercises with foreign forces are an integral part of our policies of providing our national defence and fostering regional engagement. They help strengthen bilateral defence cooperation with allies and friends, assist in the mutual development of effective self-defence capabilities, and improve interoperability with other countries' defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While foreign forces may provide their own stores while on deployment in Australia, it is more cost effective for them to procure stores locally than transport them from home countries. In general, the only stores imported by visiting forces are spare parts and munitions which are not available in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Goods and services acquired by foreign forces in Australia are either purchased directly by those forces or provided by RAAF through existing contracts with suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wherever practical, RAAF contracts for goods and services are placed on suppliers in the geographic region in which the supplies are consumed. Where foreign forces are provided with goods and services through RAAF contracts, the cost of those goods and services are recovered from those forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Total costs to be recovered by Air Force in 1993-94 from foreign forces deployed to the Northern Territory is expected to be some $9.2m. These recoveries relate predominantly to fuel, but also reflect stores, accommodation costs (power, water and rations), and charges for depreciation on capital assets. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the expenditure either through RAAF contracts or directly by foreign forces on fuel, stores and accommodation costs, the presence of these forces in the Northern Territory provides additional income to the local economy, particularly in the tourism, accommodation, restaurant and entertainment sectors.</PARA>

<PARA>Once again Mr Graham and his committee, the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee, have done a fine job and presented a very fine report. I think it is really a testimony to their hard work that the tobacco industry has hitherto enjoyed much of the prosperity it has. Of course, now everything is about to change and a dark shadow is being cast over many communities involved in tobacco, particularly in Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The town of Mareeba, not far from where I live, is very much dependent on tobacco production. This report in fact highlights how dependent Mareeba is on the production of tobacco. Tobacco produces $44.69 million worth of income for that town each year. That was the figure for the 1993 selling year, but in previous years it has been higher still. The only reason the figure is what it is, is that the quotas have been wound back. As a consequence, the growers have been able to produce less tobacco. There are still over 300 growers in Queensland, most of them in the Mareeba area. It is not just single growers&mdash;there are families and family farm groups&mdash;and the implications of losing $44.69 million worth of income for a town the size of Mareeba are absolutely devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to remind honourable senators that it is not just the town of Mareeba that is affected if the production of tobacco in Far North Queensland is reduced because much of the income of Mareeba is spent in Cairns and surrounding towns. So there will be a flow-on effect to the local economy in Cairns, not quite as dramatic as the flow-on effect to the local economy in Mareeba but in these tough economic times any flow-on effect, any drop in income for the business sector, has to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of this, our government seems determined to push on with the deregulation of the tobacco industry with an end to the quota system and an end basically to orderly marketing. I think it is very clear that orderly marketing has played a very important role in producing high levels of income for growers, and at the same time has ensured that the processors of the tobacco have the opportunity to purchase product at an agreed rate in an orderly fashion. It is interesting to note that only about 1.3 per cent of the total production last year went to arbitration. That shows how much confidence there is in the grading system and how much satisfaction both producers and processors have had with the outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the states, tobacco is a very lucrative money earner. State licence fees alone in the 1992-93 financial year totalled $1.568 billion. In the 1992-93 financial year alone the excise tax take on tobacco was $1 1/2 billion. In Queensland, which has had a tobacco excise since only 1988-89, the total income to 1992-93 from this tax was $741.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that no government in this country has a morale right to say, `We will now cast the tobacco industry into the abyss.' No state government has the right to say that it will simply turn its back on the tobacco growers and leave them to fend for themselves. It is not good enough either that the terms of reference for the tobacco working group merely talk about reporting on alternative products that could be grown in tobacco growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the prosperity not just of the growers but everybody who lives in these regions that we produce outcomes that are going to see high levels of income maintained. Mareeba has already copped a dreadful beating and anything that exacerbates the problems will only increase the family and social tensions in those areas. Therefore, we must look long and hard to find ways to give tobacco growers in this country a fair go. They have made a big contribution to our economy. Some 50 per cent or more of state licence fees come from Australian grown tobacco. I believe it is time that the state governments and the federal government put some money in instead of taking it out. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

My colleague Senator O'Chee, who resides near to the Mareeba tobacco fields, understands as I do the problems that the industry is going through at the moment. I suppose one could say generally that there has never been an industry that has been treated more like a milch cow than the tobacco industry. Total government revenue from this industry is $8.7 billion. This is the amount that the industry pays in taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry has been a good industry. It has employed a lot of people and has opened up North Queensland. The industry was established in the early 1930s as an import replacement industry. In addition, infrastructure has been built around the tobacco industry in the towns of Mareeba and Dimbulah in North Queensland and Myrtleford in Victoria. The tobacco industry contributes $46 million to the areas of Mareeba and Dimbulah in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this industry has been affected by an ill wind that blows no-one any good. While I acknowledge that the GATT round has helped and will help many primary industries, it has hit the tobacco industry very hard. I have explained to Senator McMullan on a number of occasions that the tobacco industry will be a victim of GATT. The stabilisation scheme which has run for a good many years will be abolished in September of next year. Under that scheme, 57 per cent of Australian tobacco is mixed into Australian cigarettes used in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has made an error in allowing 11.184 million kilograms of tobacco to be imported into Australia. Those figures are based on the 1986, 1987 and 1988 crops when the usage was a lot higher. Tobacco usage has come down over the last seven or eight years. Australian growers will only be able to produce something like three million kilograms, or 30 per cent of what they have produced in the past. That is not their fault; it is not because they are inefficient&mdash;they are very highly efficient growers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the fact that the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), who represents the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), is here for the adjournment debate tonight. While both Senator McMullan and the minister seem to be deliberately ignoring the growing controversy surrounding the political appointment of former South Australian Labor Premier, John Bannon, to the ABC's board of directors, it is timely to remember the past failures of this man. This former Labor Premier in South Australia and former national President of the Australian Labor Party will forever be remembered by all South Australians for his gross mismanagement of the financial affairs of that state. This alone should disqualify him from this proposed appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telephones in my office in Adelaide and, indeed, here in Canberra have not stopped ringing as South Australians, including Labor voters, register their strong disgust and protest at the pending appointment of this disgraced Labor politician to this prestigious position on the ABC. It is of no less significance that when the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Adelaide last night featured the Bannon appointment the switchboard at the ABC Collinswood complex lit up like a Christmas tree, I am told, as calls poured in from people in South Australia who were clearly outraged at this appointment. There are justifiable feelings of outrage and disgust in South Australia with the realisation that this man, Mr Bannon, will walk into a cosy job at the ABC, compliments of his Labor mates here in Canberra. What possible motive, we should ask, could the Labor Party have in making such a political and controversial appointment to this, our national broadcaster? Mr Bannon's appointment to the ABC is purely political. It certainly has nothing to do with his ability to handle financial or executive management decisions. He has shown over his history as the Premier of South Australia that he has failed dismally on both of these counts. His career has demonstrated a lack of both financial and decision making skills. Here we have a former premier who resigned in disgrace for failing to prevent Australia's largest financial disaster&mdash;the $3 billion loss by South Australia's State Bank&mdash;being appointed to the ABC board. Let me quote from the findings of the royal commission into the former Premier's involvement with this financial scandal. Page 120 of the royal commission's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Treasurer (Mr Bannon) failed to address such issues and decided to maintain the existing structure of the Board is but a further example of the extent to which he allowed the Bank itself, through its Directors, to influence his judgement, even in the exercise of one of his most important statutory powers.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a former Labor premier, Mr Bannon, entrusted, as he was then as premier, with powers to control the bank's affairs who was clearly found as having failed to do so. Who is the loser? It is not Mr Bannon. It is the people of South Australia. South Australians are the ones who will be forced to endure the financial hardship inflicted upon them by this man's failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this federal Labor government seems convinced that Mr Bannon has the ability to cope with the demands of running the Australian Broadcasting Corporation with an annual budget of some $500 million. Let me challenge Senator McMullan and his colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, to have the courage to come to South Australia and ask the people of that state what they think of Mr Bannon being offered this cosy appointment. They should come and mix it with the people of South Australia. They should come and see the tragic legacy of Mr Bannon's failed management before they proceed with this appointment. Yesterday when I raised this issue in this chamber, in defending this appointment, Minister McMullan accused me of character assassination of Mr Bannon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that Senator McMullan is a little muddled in the head in regard to this issue, because it seems he has got his head firmly buried in the sand and the rot has set in. I remind honourable senators that criticism of Mr Bannon is not based on party lines. I will read some statements written by the honourable member for Makin in South Australia, a federal member of this parliament in the other place, who shares my concerns, and those of thousands of South Australians, about Mr Bannon's capabilities. Peter Duncan's comments are contained in a foreword to the book by Adelaide political journalist, Chris Kenny, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of Denial</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bannon, of course, has sought to off-load any real blame. He has attempted to say that he accepts responsibility in a constitutional sense, but not in other senses. This cannot be accepted and certainly will not be the judgment of history.</PARA>
<PARA>He states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The full horror of the Bannon years is yet to be felt. When the impact of arguably Australia's greatest financial disaster finally becomes apparent to this state's taxpayers, there is little doubt that South Australians for generations to come will rue the day they heard the names Tim Marcus Clark and John Charles Bannon.</PARA>

"The former Premier of South Australia, Mr John Bannon, is to join the ABC board in a revamp designed to bring the ABC back to its charter as a national broadcaster." That makes it an interesting story from a number of angles. John Bannon, new member of the ABC board, good morning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN BANNON&mdash;ABC BOARD: Keith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: Congratulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Thanks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: is this your first major public commitment, John, since your retirement from the premiership about twenty one months ago?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Yes, it is, Keith. I've been doing one or two other things, but I've actually sort of tried to keep, you know, offers and possibilities at arms length, but this one was put to me a while back and I thought, "Well, that's something I'd really be interested in and feel I could make a contribution." so I said yes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: After the way in which you were, you know, were required to leave, I suppose, you made your decision to leave public office, have you been wary of the idea of public service again?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Not so much public service, but certainly public prominence and I don't want to, sort of, revisit the scenes of my political activities. I regard myself now as, you know, a private citizen with, I would hope something to contribute, but not, sort of, up there in front with lights and bells.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: It might be difficult to avoid politics with a little p, though. There are some big issues confronting the ABC. What's this idea that maybe you would help bring the ABC back towards its charter as a national broadcaster? What might you bring to that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Well, I'm not quite sure what's in mind there. My guess would be that it's linked very much to the concept of a national broadcaster not being a centralised broadcaster. As you would know, at that.. at the national level I was always a very keen advocate of what I saw as the Federal principle, the diversity and regionalism of Australia is one of its strengths, and the ABC, I believe, has a very specific brief, to ensure that it is truly national, that is it has regional presence, and you know, with economies of scale, changing technology, and so on, that's been under threat lately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: There is concern about commercialisation within the ABC, particularly as the Asian arm, the sort of international television arm is backed by sponsorship. Do you have concerns about that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: I think you've got to be careful about it. One of the justifications of a national broadcaster is that ability to stand aside from the immediate commercial considerations, not to feel, whether directly or indirectly, beholden to those who are financing it in the commercial sector. And that.. that's an important principle. Having said that, I certainly wouldn't have a totally closed mind and indeed it'd be wrong of me to do so without having looked at the various issues that are before me, but that's the direction that I come from. But the independence of the ABC, in part, derives from the independent base of its funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: In private life now. I think as a student.. you're a student at Flinders?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Yes, that's right. I'm fully engaged at the moment and enjoying it considerably, researching the 1890's Federation issues as much as anything. I'm.. in terms of immediate focus I guess I'm about a hundred years behind the times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: Right. Except that that's going to be an issue on which we might consult you another time, what it means to Federation a hundred years on. But someone else will do the job for you when you're introduced at the first meeting, which is when, John?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Well, that I don't know. I've been.. indeed I wasn't even aware the announcement was going to be made until.. until contacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: Well, sometime soon you're going to front the rest of the ABC board, old and new members and someone will have to tell them how long you've been involved in the ABC. When did you first stand on a box as an ABC actor?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: Oh, gee. I've.. I've.. I reckon it's about forty years ago.. [Laugh]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONLON: [Laugh]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BANNON: I was ten at the time. Short pants, standing on a box, yeah. I've had a fair bit of contact with the ABC. Most of the first half to three quarters of that was very positive and favourable, but I have to admit that in those end years of my premiership I got a pretty hard time from it as well, but that's.. that's exactly what they should be doing in terms of their job.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If any members of the Senate remain in any uncertainty about the intention of that appointment, let them take note of Mr Bannon's responses in the transcript of that interview. We need to conduct a very close examination of the make-up of the board of the ABC. In recent years it certainly appears to have become God's little waiting room for disgraced Labor premiers, Labor Party hacks, Labor Party pollsters, trade union officials and former Labor ministerial advisers. So it is no wonder that Senator McMullan at yesterday's estimates hearings with regard to the ABC said that he did not know what the selection criteria were for such appointments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a quick look at the experience of some of the members of the board of the ABC. They include Mr Rod Cameron, an adviser to the Australian Labor Party on political trends and strategies until 1990; Janine Walker, an industrial officer with the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union; and Len Hingley, another union official, and federal secretary of the Australian Bank Employees' Union and an executive member of the ACTU. They are three clear Labor linked appointees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that today Senator Alston revealed that yet another political appointment is eminent, that of Ms Wendy Silva from Western Australia, a former political adviser to the disgraced former Burke Labor Government in Western Australia, and now, of course, this appointment of John Bannon, we can see exactly where the appointments to the board of the ABC are heading. When we take those two pending appointments into account it means that five of the nine members of the board of the ABC have close links with the Labor Party&mdash;strong Labor Party links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen with these appointments is that Labor has neatly given itself control of the ABC.

I warn the minister that, if the government proceeds with these appointments, with this stacking of the ABC board, it will suffer a demonstrable political backlash in South Australia as well as in the rest of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak on the Port Hinchinbrook development in North Queensland. I want to raise some concerns that are not connected with the environment, although that was one of the issues which have brought on this debate. Other colleagues I believe will cover that this evening. I want to talk about an issue related to this development which deals with the ability of big business to destroy small business operators. I refer to the tour operators in Mission Beach, which is a little beach area just north of the Port Hinchinbrook development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise the Senate that, when the Mission Beach Tourism and Development Authority first heard of the Port Hinchinbrook development, it supported that project&mdash;until it read the fine print and, in particular, the applications which the developer, Mr Keith Williams, made. Now that the authority understands what he has in mind, it is totally and unanimously opposed to that development. I have permission to mention Mr Jim Whitehead, who is one of the tour operators from Mission Beach, who operates the Quick Cat tourism business. He takes visitors to the outer Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mission Beach Tourism and Development Authority and Mr Whitehead have raised with me a number of concerns that I want to place on the record. The first concern is the threat to the reef of increased visitation. He points out that Mr Williams, in his various applications, has applied to visit every current site covered by present permits: Mission Beach, Dunk Island, Hinchinbrook Island, Beaver Reef, Zoe Bay, Brook Island, Ramsay Bay. As Mr Whitehead says, it is very much like a giant spider's web waiting to catch everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the present permits allow the maximum possible density of visitors to the reef. Mr Williams could fulfil his wish only by taking out new permits, which would allow increased visitation, or by taking over the permits of the present operators. His primary objective seems to be to take over the operation of Quick Cat to Beaver Reef. If he does this, he will be given a six-year permit. It seems that he will then build his own pontoon on the reef, which would take about two years, much closer to Hinchinbrook Passage. Eventually, he would close down the Beaver Reef operation. The concern that Mr Whitehead expresses is: how will he be able to operate, and other operators continue, if Mr Williams's applications are granted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is the development of the Clump Point jetty at Mission Beach. This has been projected for some time. A boat harbour feasibility study for Cardwell Shire and nearby areas indicates that the Clump Point development is regarded by the Department of Harbours and Marine as a very suitable site. The interesting thing is that the Oyster Point development is regarded as a most unsuitable site. So Mr Williams is flying in the face of the very best advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is strange that the Queensland government has continued to allow the development Mr Williams has proposed in the light of the advice of its own department. The advice reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The site at Oyster Point would be expensive to develop and would provide only limited areas for future expansion and development. Maintenance costs would be high. It also suffers from the disadvantage that it is close to a naturally protected area&mdash;the Hinchinbrook Channel&mdash;where safe anchorage is available without the need for high capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area at Oyster Point should not be developed as a boat harbour.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet Mr Williams is continuing. The problem for the Mission Beach operation is that, if he is granted his wish, the development of a very small marina at Mission Beach will not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more serious allegation which Mr Whitehead makes concerns the way in which Mr Williams operates. Mr Whitehead discovered some months ago that his own fuel supplier, BP, to whom he had a debt, was approached by Mr Williams and, some time after this, Mr Whitehead received a wind-up summons. He managed to retrieve the situation, but from this he began to learn the way that Mr Williams operates. He discovered that Qantas has had pressure put on it to limit the Mission Beach service, and he understands that Mr Williams wants to upgrade the airport near Cardwell for his own operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more serious is the fact that Mr Whitehead's financial adviser in Melbourne, who advises him on the very large debt that he has on his operation, was rung by Mr Williams, who put pressure on him. The question is: how did Mr Williams know who Mr Whitehead's financial adviser was? How did he get hold of the phone number? Mr Williams seems to have that kind of power. As Mr Whitehead has said, he seems to go for the jugular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To follow up my concern about the way Mr Williams operates, I have before me a letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of May 1994. It is headed `What's a mere 85 grand?', and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to "Resorting to type" in which the statement is made: "Williams can claim that to the best of his knowledge nobody lost money as a result of his last project, Hamilton Island Resort, going into receivership."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As [Sydney-based printing company] Hannanprint is a creditor of Hamilton Island Enterprises . . . I do not understand how Mr Williams can make such a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of writing, Hannanprint was an unsecured creditor of Hamilton Island Enterprises in the sum of $85,936.78, which claim has been admitted by the Scheme Trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date it has received no payment whatsoever and is still awaiting a determination by the Scheme Trustee of the total quantum of all the unsecured creditors' claims to enable shares to be issued on a pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA>So honourable senators can see that my concern is to do with not only the environment but also the way in which Mr Williams, as a very large operator, is operating and the way in which he is attempting to crush many of the small tour operators in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Williams has said, of course, that he will provide employment for the township of Cardwell. It seems as though such employment would be provided only by transferring the employment which is already provided at Mission Beach. Again, it is destruction of employment in one place to provide it in another. That seems to be a very short-sighted way of doing things. I would like to close this brief analysis of what is going on in North Queensland by quoting Mr Whitehead, who said that to support this project depends on other people and the environment suffering. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak about the concerns of many people in North Queensland with respect to this proposed development near Hinchinbrook Island and the impact that such a large-scale development will have on the Hinchinbrook Channel. Developments in the last 24 hours suggest that there is some rethinking at least about the scale of the proposal. I understand that it is now considered that the proposal may be scaled down by 25 per cent, and that is welcomed. It shows that someone is listening to the extensive concerns that have been raised in submissions received by the Office of the Coordinator-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are four key areas that I believe we still need a great deal more information about. First of all, I focus on the historic perspectives and parallels of this issue in relation to effective coastal management and protection of the environment and appropriate planning for eco-tourism projects over the past decade. I am familiar with much of the debate that went on at the time of Mr Williams's former development on Hamilton Island. Frankly, some of the issues that we are debating now, nearly 11 years later, give me a real sense of deja vu. I wonder what we have learnt in 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of major concern relates to the environmental assessment procedures. I compliment Mr Gerard Early on the nine-page submission that he submitted on behalf of the federal government's world heritage unit. Obviously, the key concerns relate to protection of world heritage values. I compliment Minister Faulkner for his decision to allow Dr Peter Valentine to assess just what values would be impacted on by the proposal as presently outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the issue of the maintenance of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. When we consider the environment it is so important that we do not just say, `There's the state boundary; that's where federal, local or state concern finishes.' If we as a nation are concerned about standards for environmental protection, we need to have local, state and federal government cooperation and close consultation. I am happy to say that the Office of the Coordinator-General is working closely on this at the moment, but I believe that process should have started some considerable time ago. Clearly, my major concern is the impact of Hinchinbrook Channel dredging on mangrove, seagrass and dugong populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern is the social impact of a development of this scale, even though it may be scaled down by 25 per cent. It is still a very considerable proposal for the small seaside resort of Cardwell. There are questions relating to the water supply and to the impact on land valuations and how that could affect the 40 per cent of local people who rent in the Cardwell community. If this development is of such a scale, what will the standard of accommodation for workers be? Will they be competing with the 40 per cent of the residents of Cardwell who are renting and who will find that rents and valuations will rise? There will be much greater competition for available property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social impact also raises issues of health, including insect control and sewerage. Of course, the environmental impact affects these issues. These are just some of the issues that have been raised with me by local government. I spent a short time with the Cardwell Shire Council last week, and I have talked to a number of different representatives in the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that I would like to focus on in conclusion is the lack of consideration and consultation, and the lack of appreciation of the cultural heritage of this region; the failure to be in touch with new standards that apply following the extensive debate last year in relation to native title and the need to protect archaeological sites. At this stage I would like to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of Mr Russell Butler, whose family and ancestors have long traditional links with the Hinchinbrook region. He is accompanied by Ms Susan Brown from the North Queensland Conservation Council. They, with a number of others, are working very hard to question the processes, the lack of consultation, the failure to seriously examine some of the very real concerns that have been raised in submissions to the Office of the Coordinator-General. I refer in particular to the fact that we have not had a real environmental impact or social impact statement; we have had a review of environmental issues&mdash;a very unusual process, I am sure many honourable senators will agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the Lands Branch of the Division of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs facilitated a land workshop at Cardwell from 16 to 18 May this year, where the issues associated with Hinchinbrook and Oyster Point were canvassed. The resolutions in relation to Port Hinchinbrook were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we seek more time to respond to the development reports and request funding so that we can employ someone to review the reports and to explain to us what the development is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That an Aboriginal person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>supported by the local people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be employed to monitor the building and operation of the resort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We seek discussions with the developer about a range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommend a social impact study and an anthropological study regarding the development area should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Identify and assess Aboriginal hunting, fishing and foraging rights in Hinchinbrook Channel and around the Oyster Point area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determine future access and traditional use of Oyster Point area if the development proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not only at the local level that these issues have been raised; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in its submission raised the question of the cultural heritage impact&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Michelle Bird's Cultural Heritage Assessment of the specific site area records the fact that it was, in fact, carried out after the damage had been done, therefore the major value is in the comments and recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general area represents an extensive Aboriginal domain which is about to be subjected to major tourism development and impact&mdash;particularly on Hinchinbrook Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no attempt to assess the projected visitor numbers, destinations and use in a framework of social impacts related to destruction or desecration of cultural resources . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A four day cultural heritage assessment of a specific site is inadequate and inappropriate to address the broader concerns of the Aboriginal people . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Final project approval should not be granted until Aboriginal groups have been provided the opportunity to negotiate and agree to acceptable practical controls and decision making ability to ensure the protection and management of their heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>In the short time available to me this evening, I have outlined a range of issues. It clearly indicates to me that a development of this scale should not be rushed. We need much more time for consultation. We need much more information about the impact on the local community, because a development of this kind is there forever. We want to ensure that it is appropriate to this unique and special region. </PARA>

I must confess that I am not one who has a great deal of the detail of the Oyster Point-Port Hinchinbrook development on me. I have received no briefings from Mr Williams or anyone else. It is important that this debate be factually correct and that there be no campaign of misinformation organised by people who, for one reason or another, oppose any sort of development in North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not a lot of confidence normally in the Queensland state Labor government but I do in this instance believe, and it has not been suggested to me differently, that the state Labor government has properly assessed this proposal. I am also confident that the Cardwell Shire Council, which is the shire council relevant to this area, will have looked at the proposal sensibly. I know that Councillor Tip Burn, a Labor man but still a great guy and a good friend of mine, who heads the Cardwell Shire Council, will ensure that all of the council's requirements, and the powers that the council has in planning matters, are taken into account in determining this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit concerned to hear Senator Woodley embark upon what seems to have been a personal attack on Mr Williams. I do not know Mr Williams; I have never met him, but he is a man who has done a lot for Queensland over the years&mdash;maybe he has done a lot for himself at the same time, I do not know. Certainly he has done a lot to develop North Queensland and deserves better than to be denigrated in this parliament. He had a proposal which he put to the authorities and he was given the go-ahead, as I understand it, and getting into slanging matches over personalities and their backgrounds does not seem to be a way of advancing the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came down to the chamber this afternoon because I thought that when Senator Woodley and Senator Reynolds got up to speak they would take the opportunity to correct some information they gave the parliament at the Senate estimates committee yesterday about this development. We were talking about this in the estimates committee and I said, `How big is it?' and I think Senator Woodley said, `It's 2 1/2 thousand guests,' and I think Senator Reynolds said, `Yes, that is right.' I said, `I'm surprised, I didn't realise it was that big; are you sure that's right?'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate will not be assisted by wrong information being given to the Senate about these particular things. The project is a good idea. I insist and agree that it must be done in an environmentally sensitive way. The most sensitive and stringent environmental conditions should be imposed and the developer must comply with them&mdash;I have no argument with that. However, I do have an argument about people who seem to object to development for the sake of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal unemployment in Queensland is very high. The best thing we can do for the Aboriginal community, particularly the unemployed, is get them jobs. Aboriginals can be employed in the resort when it gets going. There is a very good Aboriginal community at Murray Upper. I am sure they would be very keen to get international tourists into the Cardwell area so that they can sell their wares&mdash;and Murray Upper produces some magnificent wares. I am sure people there would get a job in a resort that will attract 1,500 international or Australian tourists. It is important that we consider those aspects when we talk about these developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go on at any great length, I would like to leave Senator Chamarette some opportunity to speak. Senator Woodley has obviously been spoken to by some businessmen at Mission Beach. I do not think they would like him calling it a `tiny seaside town north of Cardwell'. Those of us who know Mission Beach would describe it a bit better than that. Obviously where business competition comes in some people are at times a bit hesitant about the competition. The Cardwell Chamber of Commerce, representing the Cardwell community, has made its views known. It has written to Senator Kernot, asking her to bring Senator Woodley into line. It has pointed out, quite properly to Senator Kernot, details about the mangroves about which we all have some hesitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chamber points out that the developer wants to remove 6.4 hectares. Its figures are one in 2,400th of the mangroves growing in that area, obviously not a very big area. The chamber points out that, if this does not go ahead, just dredging into the jetty at Cardwell will destroy more seagrass than will this development. That jetty will be dredged&mdash;it is already there; it has been there for ages. If this development does not go ahead, dredging will have to continue. The chamber also talks about turbidity and makes some very good points. I will not go through its material. But it is interesting to say that there is a lot of community support for the resort. There is an opportunity to create jobs that are so desperately needed in North Queensland. Again, it is a great project that could earn export dollars for Queensland and Australia&mdash;dollars which we so desperately need to get this country out of its economic mess. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Some monies may be held for longer than 7 days. The money paid by the non-custodial parent is held in a trust account before it is paid to the custodian by the Department of Social Security (DSS). While this is a non-interest earning account, the money forms part of the Commonwealth Public Account. The daily credit balance of this attracts interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The general position is that no money is deducted from payments received by the CSA. However, the non-custodial parent can incur costs if he or she fails to pay maintenance on time. Those costs, payable by the non-custodial parent to the CSA, can include interest on judgment, late payment penalty and legal costs. Money intended as maintenance payments are not applied to those other debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases the custodian may have been overpaid in previous months, creating a debt to the Consolidated Revenue. In those cases monthly payments are reduced to gradually decrease that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The CSA passes the money to the DSS in one of two ways. If the non-custodial parent or employer paid the money to the Agency on time, the CSA passes it to the DSS on the second Wednesday of the month. The DSS pays it to the custodian on the third Wednesday of the month. Otherwise, the CSA passes the money to the DSS on the last Wednesday of the month. The DSS then pays it to the custodian on the first Wednesday of the next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No payments are withheld if the correct amount is not received by the CSA. Any payments received are passed on to the custodian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes there may be a delay before a payment is passed by the CSA to the DSS. When the CSA receives a payment it necessarily carries out several checks. If the non-custodial parent paid by cheque, the bank must clear it. When an employer is deducting money from the salary or wages of a number of non-custodial parents, the CSA must reconcile the amounts paid by the employer to ensure the full amount due is paid. Sometimes employers remit only part of the child support they have deducted, or they remit late. The non-custodial parent may take unpaid leave, or receive pay in advance for leave, and so the CSA receives less or more money than expected. The need to establish what has been paid and who it is for can affect when payments are passed to the DSS for payment to the custodian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The custodian can elect for the CSA not to collect a registrable maintenance liability, and this could then be paid directly by the non-custodial parent to the custodian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further options depend on whether the custodian receives an income tested pension, allowance or benefit. If the custodian does not, the custodian can elect at any time for the liability not to be collected by the CSA. Also, if the liability being collected by the CSA is in the form of an administrative assessment the custodian can elect to end the liability. If the custodian does receive an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, the custodian must elect for the CSA not to collect their liability when first applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under changes that I announced on 6 April 1994, custodians who receive an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, and who are receiving regular child support payments, will be given the option of choosing to have the child support paid privately, even after the CSA has commenced collecting.</PARA>
