<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. I refer to the Auditor-General's report released yesterday which outlined the abuse of the government credit card system. Among other things, the report indicated that the credit card had been used to buy sunglasses, watches, flowers, golf lessons and nightwear. Is it not a fact that, despite heavy warnings from the Auditor-General in his first report last year, the government has done nothing to rectify the inadequate control systems revealed by the Auditor-General in that report? What action will the government now take as a result of this scandal revealed in the latest Auditor-General's report? Is the government considering abandoning the credit card system?</PARA></TALK.START>

One of them was sunglasses, which he cited as a misuse of the credit card.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have quite a long list of other items which have attracted the attention of journalists and which similarly have a quite reasonable&mdash;indeed, quite praiseworthy&mdash;reason for their purchase but which, at first glance, attract the sort of attention exhibited by Senator Kemp. There is a need to distinguish between credit card fraud and the misuse of the government credit card. It may be that some of the items that have been referred to colourfully in the press have been wrongly purchased but not in a fraudulent manner. They fulfil a particular need of government procurement in a particular department. The way in which the credit card was used was the wrong way of buying those goods, but those goods would have always had to have been bought by the department. I distinguish that type of practice from actual fraudulent use of the credit card.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the interjection of my colleague the Minister for Defence for the purpose of getting his remarks in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is important to note that they are back in stores, although they were purchased initially for military use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, of course, views very seriously any misuse of the government credit card. From that point of view, no doubt the particular departments of the government will take specific action in order to ensure that best practice use of credit cards is followed. There has been an edict issued along these lines, the departments are advised to follow it and they are doing so. Therefore, improper use of the card should cease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as fraudulent activities are concerned, in a huge organisation like the Commonwealth there is always the risk that somewhere someone might misconduct himself and, indeed, conduct himself in an illegal way. The report found that since 1987 there have been 46 reported cases of fraud using the credit cards, a misuse totalling between $1.8 million and $2 million. But it should be noted that over the same period 2.7 million transactions took place, totalling $1.6 billion. There is no element of acceptable fraudulent use, but I quote those figures to illustrate that what we are talking about here is a very small element of the total overall transaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the government does not believe that the credit card itself is at fault. The government certainly is constrained to ensure that the card's use is properly managed and that it is used as a flexible means of government purchasing in an appropriate way, and to deal with fraud when and if it occurs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the audit the precise location of the sunglasses . . . was unknown. The department has subsequently advised that it believes the items are held at a location in New South Wales. However, despite conducting some enquiries, the ANAO has been unable to confirm that advice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing that I have said is an attack upon the report, although particular ministers in particular departments think that the views of their departments have not been adequately reflected in the report.

It turns out, on inspection, that they were bought because a wreath was needed to lay at an Anzac Day celebration. A purchase occurred from a jeweller's shop in Townsville. This was to buy batteries in order to run a particular item of equipment necessary in the Taxation Office at that time in the case of an emergency. One could go down this list and highlight elements that are starkly interesting but their explanations are banal in the classic way of this being a controversy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the environment reporting: framework for Australia</EMPHASIS> sets up a scientifically credible system for regular reporting on our environment. One of the key features of the reporting system is that it will take environmental information from a diverse range of sources. It will present that information&mdash;the good, the bad and the ugly&mdash;in a way in which people can not only understand but also use. It will do so in a way that nobody can duck or hide from. It will also allow us to measure our overall progress in protecting the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a substitute for action. This will provide a solid information base for making informed decisions. Accuracy, relevance and impartiality will be crucial to the usefulness of this system. That is why I have established a national state of the environment advisory council. The council is made up of eminent and well-qualified Australians and it will play a critical role in helping to oversee and shape the reporting program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this system to be effective it will need scientists, industry, community groups and governments to work together to share environmental information and to share scientific knowledge. I particularly welcome the close involvement of the CSIRO in this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first national report is planned for late 1995. Future reports will be produced every four years and we will see many other useful products in between. The system will allow for regular reporting on an agreed set of national environmental indicators. These will show changes and trends in environmental conditions in much the same way as well-accepted economic and social indicators do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indicators such as interest rates, employment levels or the CPI are readily understood by the Australian public and communicate a vast amount of useful information. They are an integral part of how we keep track of the performance of our economy. No equivalent set of indicators currently exists for reporting on the environment. This is one of the key objectives of the system. It is something that I certainly regard as very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my intention that the state of the environment reporting system will act as a credible report card on the condition of Australia's environment, that it will identify the scope of the issues that confront us and that it will evaluate the effectiveness of the methods that we choose to deal with the issues that confront us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to audit report No. 21 of last year which showed that government credit card purchasing practices had resulted in a $4,500 merchant service charge for the purchase of some 202 containers, whereas the cost of payment by cheque would have been $12.60. Following that, we heard yesterday's revelation that a contractor had offered the government a 1.5 per cent discount to save himself $200,000 in credit card service fees on the purchase of staff uniforms. Why does the government continue to condone the blatant use of taxpayers' funds by not banning the use of credit cards on large purchases? Does the minister consider it acceptable for the government to forgo millions of dollars of potential savings in merchant fee charges? Will the government issue a directive to all departments to ensure that credit cards are used only where there is a demonstrated cost advantage to the Commonwealth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Like so many others, this question goes to the Auditor-General's report into the use of government credit cards. It seems to me that what is being omitted in some of the questioning, and indeed in some of the commentary coming from senators opposite, is acknowledgment of the fact that in July last year the Department of Finance issued a guide to all departments on the best practice use of government credit cards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Auditor-General's report illustrates examples of where that best practice is perhaps not being complied with because activities have been fraudulent. As well, the report points to a number of areas where, at first blush, it appears that the government credit card has been wrongly used but, on deeper examination, there is a good case to be made that it is an appropriate use of such a credit card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the government wants to see its purchasing operations effected in the best and most efficient way to ensure that the taxpayer's dollar is wisely spent, in a scrooge-like fashion. So we are not into waste and we are not into encouraging that at departmental levels of use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best practice guide is the appropriate guide&mdash;that is the one that has been followed by the departments. There will be some examples of maladministration in an organisation as large as the Commonwealth but they are, in the scale of things, minor; nonetheless, they are being addressed and sorted out. Action is being taken where fraud is committed. I also point out to the Senate that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts will, I understand, conduct a public inquiry into the use of the Commonwealth government credit cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by my brief from the Minister for Finance that he welcomes such an inquiry and that if advice from the parliament on how better to administer the system emanates from that inquiry, he will be the first to implement such advice. But I repeat that the Commonwealth does have in place a proper guide to manage the use of this card in the way intended so that it saves money for the taxpayer and is not a drain on taxpayers' funds.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1,866 transactions were not a random sample&mdash;they were a specific target group that had already been classified as "interesting" from a much larger group of 184,185 transactions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to both questions is: a great deal. There is substantial scope for development of Indonesia's agricultural sector and Australia is very well placed to assist. Many agricultural industries in Indonesia are only now just emerging from their traditional patterns of production and distribution towards modern agricultural and commercial practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high levels of technical research and marketing skills that are possessed by the Australian rural sector can readily be transferred to Indonesia, earning income for Australia from the export of these services. In recognition of this potential, the Australian and Indonesian governments established a working group on agriculture and food cooperation as one of the initiatives coming out of the Australia-Indonesia ministerial forum which is due to convene again in Canberra this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group has identified many opportunities for commercial cooperation in the food and agricultural sectors where Australia and Indonesia have complementary interests. Importantly, by conducting business forums to coincide with working group meetings, the process itself has raised the awareness of these opportunities within Indonesian and Australian businesses. There are numerous opportunities for the development of Australian trade with Indonesia, particularly in the horticulture, meat and livestock, dairy and food processing industries, and the working group has established task forces for each of these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be of some interest to the Senate to know that   the agricultural working group, even though it has been established for only a relatively short time, has facilitated the development of three new joint ventures in meat and livestock and two potential joint ventures in horticulture. Its last meeting also resulted in the Indonesian government agreeing to relax the existing restrictions on the export of live cattle from northern Australia&mdash;that was for steers only&mdash;which will mean millions of dollars of additional income which, whilst it might not have a huge impact on the national picture, is of enormous importance to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our rapidly developing skills in land and water management are also being keenly sought after by the Indonesians and other Asian countries as they begin to confront problems of overstocking and scarce water resources. The development of Indonesian food industries has been restricted by underdeveloped food storage, transport and distribution infrastructure. Australian firms are ready and able to develop these services, which will expand the potential markets that our exports can access. The working group is also a useful forum for bilateral negotiations on regulatory and other impediments on trade. I have just mentioned one regulatory impediment which was removed at the last meeting of the working group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join Senator Gareth Evans in welcoming the accelerated liberalisation of Indonesian markets. I understand that tariffs on agricultural products are to be reduced by five per cent with some raw material inputs to have a zero tariff. A senior executive of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy will visit Indonesia this week to continue the dialogue with trade and agricultural representatives of the Indonesian government. The experience of this working group in the short time that it has been established clearly demonstrates the mutual benefit to be gained by further integrating the economies of Australia and Asia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Recent Bureau of Statistics superannuation figures show that men aged between 35 and 55 are 40 per cent more likely to be covered by superannuation than are women and, on top of that, those women who actually do have super payouts in that age group will get, on average, one-quarter of the men's payout. I ask: can the minister confirm that the government is raising the women's pension access age to 65 while the superannuation access age will be 60? Can the minister explain why women like her and me who are in good superannuation schemes can access that money at 60, but so many others will have to wait an extra five years to get the pension? Can the minister explain to Australian women in low-paid, casual and part-time jobs why they should not see these policies as being one law for the rich and another for the poor? Finally, do these figures mean that women currently aged 35 to 55 will have to work until they are 120 years old before their superannuation catches up to men's?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important for Senator Kernot to be reminded that, while there is quite clearly a difference between superannuation for women and for men, there is a very big change happening and that change is to the improvement of women's access to superannuation and to their money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say to Senator Kernot that the other day Senator Lees, on behalf of the Democrats, was proposing that one way of solving this problem was to phase in the age pension for women over 40 years, that is, increase it to 65 over 40 years not 20, which indicates that the Democrats feel that the principle is okay and it is just the timing that is wrong. That is one option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end it becomes a matter of judgment between whether or not the payments of superannuation versus the prospect of women being in employment are able to be balanced against the 20-year phase for introducing the 65-year age for pensions. I remind Senator Kernot that the opposition was very inclined to do this but it wanted to introduce it over 10 years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is Senator Kernot's view. It is a matter of judgment. The Democrats say that we could do it by phasing it in over 40 years, which suggests, as I said, that we have the principle right and that it is a question of a balance between when the working prospects for women and their superannuation capacity are sufficient to justify their being able to retire at 65, not earlier than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government recognises that there is a matter of judgment in that phasing-in period and that is why it is doing it over 20 years. That is why, also on behalf of women, in moving to the 65-year phase-in it is saying that it more than appreciates the presence of women in the work force, that this is an option many women, particularly older women, want to exercise, but it also appreciates that while many women have that option, many do not. We have already seen that there are mature age allowance fallbacks for women who may find themselves not able to exercise their rights to work. So there are a number of very significant changes in this area, and it may well be that they are not all quite in kilter yet. What we have from the Minister for Social Security is clear evidence that he is very willing to listen to make sure that he has got the balance of these pieces correct. To come back to the first point, it is true that women now have access to superannuation in a way that they never did before and that that amount of superannuation is very significantly increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All women&mdash;or very large numbers of them&mdash;have it, but we admit that many of those women have access only to a very small amount of super. However, there are improved vesting provisions which mean that women can be out of work for a time and still maintain their access to super. We also note that there is still scope for improvement in the superannuation coverage for people in casual or part-time work. We know there is improvement needed there. None of that counters the fact that a 20-year introduction of a 65-year age pension is wrongly judged.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would urge a caution about those figures. There are a number of fall-back and safety provisions for women who are of that age coming into the pension and not able to either find work or continue in work. But there is obviously evidence of an increasing number of women of that age who would prefer to remain in work. The phasing in of the 65-year retirement, the phasing in of the introduction of the later age pension, Senator Kernot knows is a great leader to women and to industry about when women can retire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of making sure that we get all those facts and balances right. One option, which was suggested by the Australian Democrats, is that we do not do anything and the second is that we do it over a 40-year phase in period. Neither of those options will assist women who now have access to the work force in much larger numbers, who have access to superannuation and whose superannuation would be much larger only if they stayed longer in work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am touched by Senator Childs's reference. Nobody else seems to have noticed. I am following very big shoes in those of Senator Robert Ray of a week or two ago, and I am conscious of my responsibilities. My answer to Senator Childs's question will complement that which was given a few minutes ago by Senator Collins. I join with Senator Collins on behalf of the government in very warmly welcoming the latest package of competitive measures to be implemented by the Indonesian government that were announced yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the full scale of what is a very detailed package has not yet been fully digested, the measures in the broad consist of a reduction in tariffs&mdash;some to zero&mdash;for over 700 items and a reduction in non-tariff barriers on 27 commodities, mainly food. On the tariff side, the heavy emphasis is on capital goods, principally textile and other industrial machinery, to support Indonesia's booming manufacturing sector. This package will provide opportunities for Australian exporters to the Indonesian market and the government will be examining over the next few weeks the package very closely for the prospects that it offers and we will be advising firms through the established market intelligence processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This trade reform package is particularly welcome as it will provide real tariff cuts which are deeper than Indonesia's Uruguay Round commitments to tariff bindings and reductions. It is a further positive sign that much of the reluctance to move unilaterally on tariffs that has so often been ascribed to the developing economies&mdash;and, I have to say, in the past correctly ascribed to them&mdash;is in fact melting away in today's world of globalised production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package announced yesterday follows the significant deregulation of foreign investment which was announced by the Indonesian government earlier this month. Moreover, it is part of a very significant program of progressive micro-economic reform measures which have been proceeding for some six years. Both of these recent packages&mdash;and, indeed, the whole process of reform that has preceded them&mdash;testify to Indonesia's commitment to increase economic competition, to become more attractive to foreign investment and to generally open up what has been notoriously a highly regulated economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such steps, in turn, will enable Indonesia to continue to play a progressive role in the trade facilitation and liberalisation work of APEC, the second leaders meeting of which President Suharto will be hosting in Jakarta in November this year. The announcement also forms a very positive backdrop to the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia, to the trade and industry exhibition and to the business and investment forum that he will be opening in Jakarta tomorrow. A large number of Australian business people will have the opportunity at this business forum to examine directly this package, as will my colleague Bob McMullan who is in Indonesia leading, as has been said, the largest business mission to ever leave Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say finally just this: at a time when concern is being expressed about some other aspects of Indonesian government policy, it is important to appreciate on just how many fronts the modernisation and internationalisation of Indonesian society are proceeding. I think the larger and the longer term significance of that should be self-evident&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I understand that the Altona Toyota plant will open for production in July. The white paper on employment, industry and regional development announced that the government intended to repeal the Automotive Industry Authority Act and to transfer the resources of the authority to the industry department. Given the importance of the car industry to Victoria, I ask: what are the implications for Victorian workers of this move? In particular, what are the implications for the support programs for the automotive industry specified in the car industry plan, which was to run to the year 2000?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2069" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr is right&mdash;the $550 million investment made by Toyota in car manufacture in Australia has come to fruition and the plant at Altona in Victoria is to open early next month. It is interesting that such a major investment has been made during a difficult time in the world economy and that Australia was selected by Toyota to be a major production site for its automobiles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question is about the Automotive Industry Authority. The government has proposed in the white paper that we discontinue the authority but fold its operations into the department so that the functions that the authority carries out will be continued. Those functions will be administered by a unit within my department which will enable me and the government to have a closer hands-on association with the car industry. All of the functions that the authority carries out will be still carried through, so the Button car plan will continue to the year 2000. I believe that the plan will continue to reap the major achievements that it has thus far racked up for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the plan industry has been assisted to make the transition from a highly protected closed economy to an internationally competitive economy. The car industry as a core industry for Australia has been given some special assistance by way of the plan to make the transition to international competitiveness. The plan has resulted in a rationalisation of manufacturing facilities in Australia. It has also resulted, it should be said, in increased volumes of production, increased profitability for the car manufacturing companies themselves, increases in investment as well from overseas parents and, in a tribute to Australian workplace ability, a dramatic increase in the quality of cars manufactured in Australia over the period of the plan thus far. Profits in the car industry in Australia in 1993 totalled $52.8 million. Given that these profits came during a recovery, but nonetheless a patchy recovery, they indicate a quite strong performance by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that what the industry is now looking forward to in Australia is increased sales as the recovery gathers pace in the manner that it has. In May this year 53,000 motor vehicles were sold. That is an increase of 21 per cent on sales for April this year&mdash;quite a dramatic increase. The industry anticipates that year through sales growth in Australia 1994 versus 1993 will show a growth of about eight or nine per cent overall and that we will top sales of 600,000 newly produced motor vehicles for that period. There are massive benefits in this for the component manufacturers, many of which are medium sized Australian-owned companies as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The surest sign that this industry will be able to make the transition to be globally competitive is the level of investment that is flowing&mdash;not only the investment for Toyota that I referred to at the head of this answer but also the investment of some $500 million announced for Mitsubishi in South Australia. Also, major investments are in the pipeline for General Motors and so on&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">one can go through the producers. The total investment in motor vehicle manufacture in Australia was $2 billion over the period 1990 to 1993. It is certainly the government's intention to maintain the policy settings so that we have a stable base for this industry to thrive.</PARA>

I note that the minister failed for three months even to acknowledge the receipt of that letter. I also refer to a follow-up letter from the president in October 1993 and to a letter from another Afghan Australian community leader raising further serious allegations concerning the background to Mr Miakhel's presence in Australia. I ask the minister: why did he do nothing to follow up these serious allegations for 13 months, from May 1993 to last Wednesday, and only then after they were aired on national television and in this chamber 24 hours earlier, despite receiving at least three representations about the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short raises a matter which has been of concern. He referred to a letter of 24 May 1993 from Mr Besodi, I believe. I have gone through my office files and processes. In fact, there have been six contacts with the department with respect to that correspondence between the date that it was sent and a few weeks before this matter was raised publicly. It is not that I did nothing. In fact, we have had this under active consideration. As Senator Short knows, the process in the department has not responded to the references by the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that Senator Short is talking about is not an easy one. It has problems in terms of identity and we recognised those before. It also has problems in terms of presuming guilt or jumping to conclusions. The matters Senator Short raises have been aired quite recently on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. They go to a number of individuals. In fact one person that those opposite have consistently asked me about is a third person involved here&mdash;not Mr Miakhel but a third person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in this particular case when those opposite raise these sorts of issues they should appreciate there are problems for all of us&mdash;problems of identity and problems of presuming guilt. It is almost certain that the third person, for instance, in this matter is a person who was initially refused his claim by the department. The matter was raised with Minister Ray, it was reassessed and after a process the UNHCR accorded this person refugee status. But that refugee status was not granted just by the UNHCR. In regard to the third person, the person those opposite are so concerned about with respect to this government tracking him down, that matter also was of interest to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Robert Ray was minister, Senator Alston wrote to him at the time claiming that the case of the third person was becoming acute. He also went on to say&mdash;in fact urgently demanded&mdash;that the Australian government should issue a temporary entry permit to the person involved, to the general, the third person, in order to prevent his deportation and certain execution. That is the person who is supposed to have been the terrorist&mdash;the third person those opposite have referred to, the third person whose identity is almost certainly known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but he got universal endorsement by the opposition leadership. Senator Hill on 20 June with respect to this person wrote to the minister saying, `As the situation is urgent I am appealing to you to exercise your powers . . . and grant' the general `immediate entry to Australia on special humanitarian grounds.' Not only that but two days after Senator Hill put out a press statement expressing his deep disgust that Senator Ray had taken two days to consider this application. He said, `The acting minister should immediately grant a temporary visa to the general so that at least he will be out of the considerable danger he will be in after Friday.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These cases are difficult because of identification, as I said earlier. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand come in here and condemn government for allowing someone in when, in 1989, the united leadership opposite urged us to approve the matter urgently. They cannot come in here now and accuse someone of having a sleazy character and condemn that person, when four years ago those opposite presented him as an acceptable character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been pursing these matters and are investigating them thoroughly. That is the way to do it, not the presumption of guilt or innocence those opposite are making. This matter has been pursued by my office on six occasions. Those opposite well know that there are difficulties of identification. But on this particular point those opposite do not have egg on their face; they have the whole omelette.</PARA>

Confidentiality, of course, is commonly sought as market sensitive information is usually involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the ASC that that is the case here, and the target company, Foodland Associated Ltd, has agreed to that confidential status. Section 750 of the Corporations Law requires the offerer in a part A statement to disclose all material information to the target shareholders that will affect the target shareholders in making their decision. I am further informed that any alleged agreement between Rank and Coles-Myer would have to be set out in any part A offer to target shareholders. Thus, if the offer does go public, any such agreement will be exposed at that time. So there will be disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My further advice is that the new provisions that Senator Spindler refers to have not as yet been proclaimed, so the point that he raises is not even relevant here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister apologise for misleading the parliament in his false claim, repeated for the third time yesterday in the House of Representatives, that the Environment Protection Authority of New South Wales had lost a pollution action against his then half-owned, environmentally questionable Parkville piggery and that the EPA had to suffer `a humiliating retraction of its statement'? Why did the Prime Minister continue to repeat this false attack on the EPA when he knew that it was false and that the only failed EPA prosecution of a Keating piggery was of a totally different, far distant, relatively small piggery at Tamworth in 1991 for illegally discharging effluent into a creek, and that the prosecution failed only on the technical point that the pollution flowed into a paddock before entering the creek? Will the Prime Minister at last tell the truth about his polluting Parkville piggery where he planned a multimillion dollar expansion and which his own environmental consultants, Camp, Scott and Furphy, admitted in public hearing had been polluting the environment while Mr Keating half-owned it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question involves an action in the New South Wales courts. It is not a matter which falls remotely in any way into the Prime Minister's portfolio. It does, of course, involve allegations against a company in which the Prime Minister used to hold shares but in which he no longer has any interest whatsoever. My understanding is that a prosecution can be brought by the EPA of New South Wales against the directors of a company or its operational manager. The Prime Minister was never a director or an operational manager. So I fail to see how this prosecution or anything the Prime Minister has said about this prosecution can be said to involve him personally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Baume wants to make accusations about people or companies being guilty of anything, he should be careful. No guilt has been proven in the particular prosecution he is referring to which is, since last Friday, absolutely sub judice. If he cannot get his act sorted out about which context he is asking questions in, and if he leaves some residual uncertainty in people's minds about which particular prosecution he is talking about, that is not the Prime Minister's responsibility or mine to clean up; it is his. He should just try to clean up his act generally instead of pursuing this issue which has nothing to do with any issue of public accountability.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister to perhaps clean up his act because he says it is nothing to do with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has misled the parliament. That is not unusual, but it has something to do with the parliament. I ask: was Mr Keating deliberately misleading the parliament, or was he wrong because he either did not know or did not care whether his then owned Parkville piggery was polluting the environment or not? Why did the Prime Minister make the equally false claim yesterday that the Keating piggery had not been notified by the EPA of this month's prosecutions against it for two separate acts of pollution last year while he was its half owner when, in fact, the Parkville piggery was informed of the decision on 17 June and the EPA public announcement of the charges was not until five days later?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, Mr President, the Prime Minister is perfectly accurate in saying that an action by the authority against the particular company in respect of some aspect of its piggery operations did in fact fail. That is what he said. It might have been a different question that Senator Baume was referring to yesterday. But, if he cannot, as I said, straighten out this sort of confusion, he cannot expect the Prime Minister to do so in a situation where he has not, and never has had, any operational responsibility for the affairs of the company. He has never been a director of the company. He has never been its operational manager. He has never been someone who has had the responsibility for that sort of thing.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SENATE QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Nick Bolkus&mdash;On 27 June 1993 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 1996) Senator O'Chee asked me as the Minister representing the Attorney-General the following question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will councils affected by native title claims be assured that the Commonwealth will pay their legal expenses in the same way as it is paying the legal expenses of Aboriginal claimants?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councils affected by native title claims may apply for financial assistance for the payment of legal expenses under the guidelines approved by the Minister for Justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are broadly three guidelines which must be satisfied before a grant of financial assistance will be made to a party affected by a native title claim. They are that the applicant for funding is not eligible for funding from another source, that the applicant for the financial assistance will suffer hardship if the application is refused and lastly that it is reasonable for a grant of financial assistance to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hardship means financial hardship. While each application is considered on its own facts, in an ordinary case, to show hardship a council would have to show that it could not raise funds from its usual funding base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding the last criterion&mdash;reasonableness&mdash;three factors are considered, that is the prospects of success (or whether there is a good case to argue), whether the costs of the case will be worth the benefit to the applicant for financial assistance and the benefit to the general public from a decision in the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for legal assistance matters, considers that the case is a test case, more weight will be given to the reasonableness criterion than the hardship criterion. This is because test cases will resolve important issues of Commonwealth law and are of benefit to the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attached a copy of the guidelines for granting Financial Assistance by the Attorney-General in Native Title cases and an explanatory note on the Provision of Financial Assistance by the Attorney-General in Native Title Matters for information for Senator O'Chee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Provision of Financial Assistance by the Attorney-General in Native Title Matters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In certain circumstances, the Attorney-General may provide financial assistance to people involved in native title cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for assistance made by representative bodies under section 203 of the Native Title Act 1993 should be made to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statutory Native Title Scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main scheme for the provision of financial assistance by the Attorney-General for native title matters is established under section 183 of the Native Title Act 1993. This allows the Attorney-General to provide financial assistance to respondents and non-claimant applicants under the Act, provided they meet certain eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As currently drafted, section 183 of the Act only allows provision of financial assistance to people who are involved in an inquiry before the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) or in proceedings before the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been decided that applicants for assistance in matters before recognised State courts and tribunals and applicants who need assistance prior to the inquiry stage may apply to the Attorney-General under a separate scheme. The Native Title Financial Assistance Scheme guidelines will be applied to applications to determine whether a grant is made under the Special Circumstances Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Non-statutory Common Law Native Title Scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that the Native Title Act, and the National Native Title Tribunal established under the Act, are the best way of reaching determinations of native title. The government believes the Native Title Act regime will deliver determinations in a way that benefits the whole Australian community, in a quick manner which is less costly than the courts. However, the government realises that some claimants will nevertheless wish to seek remedies from the Supreme, Federal or High Courts which they cannot get through the Native Title Act regime. And the respondents in those cases will not be able to get financial assistance through the Native Title Act schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, a non-statutory scheme administered by the Attorney-General to provide assistance for respondents in common law native title matters has been established. Assistance may also be provided, in very limited circumstances, to claimants under common law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Claimants may seek funding for injunctions under this scheme. However, the availability of funding from other sources would have to be considered, along with other guidelines. No indemnity for costs or damages can be offered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Test Cases</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A test case is a case brought to test a principle of law that, once established, can be applied to other similar cases. For native title matters, this means a case where an important question about the Native Title Act, or another Commonwealth law, will be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A committee has been established to advise the Attorney-General regarding whether certain cases are test cases. Membership of the committee comprises representatives of ATSIC, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC), and the National Farmers' Federation (NFF). Other representatives may be invited to sit on the committee as appropriate i.e. representatives of the tourism or fishing industries. The Attorney-General will consider advice from the committee when determining financial assistance grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Assistance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant of assistance will be either a percentage of reasonable professional costs (usually 80% of Federal Court Scale fees) or a lump sum fee that the Attorney-General agrees will be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial assistance, whether it be provided under the Native Title Act or under the common law native title scheme, is subject to the applicant meeting certain eligibility guidelines. These guidelines are set out separately and are available from:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In certain circumstances, the Attorney-General may provide financial assistance to people involved in native title cases under the Native Title Act 1993. The Attorney-General may also provide financial assistance to respondents or plaintiffs in common law matters who are unable to obtain funding from elsewhere under a native title common law financial assistance scheme.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under these guidelines, the following definitions apply:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for financial assistance in native title matters will be decided by the Attorney-General or someone who the Attorney-General has authorised to make the decision for him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person applying for financial assistance will need to provide detailed information about the costs that they think they will have to pay and the reasons that they think each cost will be necessary. They will also need to give details of the way that the amount of each item has been calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any grant of assistance may be made either with or without conditions. If there are any conditions they will be described at the time that the grant is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the Attorney-General will grant assistance a person must show that it will cause hardship to them if the application is not granted. They must also show that it is reasonable for a grant of assistance to be made to them. They must also be ineligible for financial assistance from any other source, such as a prescribed Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander representative body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Hardship</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hardship means financial hardship. Hardship refers to whether the person applying for assistance is able to meet the cost of the case without getting into serious financial difficulty. In deciding whether refusing a grant will involve hardship to an applicant all relevant information is taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason people applying for assistance will need to provide information about their income, expenditure, assets and liabilities and the amount that it is estimated the case will cost. When assessing a person's financial situation, the assets that are in dispute as a result of the native title claim will not be taken into account although these must be listed in the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the person applying for assistance is a respondent in a test case the Attorney-General also considers how important it is that the law that is being tested is made clearer by a decision of a court. A test case is a case where the Court is being asked to decide the meaning of an important question about some part of the Native Title Act or another Commonwealth law. For this reason much more importance is given to whether it is reasonable to grant assistance than is given to hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application for assistance must provide full details of the case including the question that will be answered by the Court and any other matters a Court decision will make clearer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General may ask for advice from other government agencies or industry bodies to help him or her decide whether it would be reasonable to grant the request for financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Payment of costs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Attorney-General decides to grant assistance he will only agree to pay costs that are reasonable and proper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The person asking for assistance will need to nominate a lawyer to conduct the case. The lawyer chosen must be experienced in conducting cases in the Federal Court or a superior court of a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of assistance granted will be either a percentage of reasonable professional costs (usually 80% of Federal Court Scale fees) or a lump sum fee that the Attorney-General agrees will be paid. It is very important that your legal adviser understands what costs will be paid and the amount that will be paid for each item before he or she starts work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant of assistance may be made in stages. Because costs for one stage of the case are paid this does not mean that all the costs will be paid. For example, a limited grant may be made to investigate the reasonableness of the case or a grant may be made for mediation only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be a condition of the grant that the parties who are assisted by the Attorney-General make some payment towards the cost of the case. This is called a contribution. Any contribution will be based on the party's ability to pay. If you have to make a contribution, the amount to be paid will be clear from the information that is given at the time that the grant is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will always be asked to repay any amount that the Court awards to you as costs if you win.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All grants of assistance are monitored by the Attorney-General who may ask for information from time to time.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are applying for assistance you should make sure that you have provided all the information that will be needed before the Attorney-General can make a decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Kemp this day, relating to a report of the Auditor-General on the use of the Australian Government credit card.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the response that Senator Cook has just given. It was about time; it should have been given during question time. It should have been a clear sign that the Department of Finance was prepared to take the Auditor-General's report seriously. I do not blame Senator Cook for this because I notice he was reading from a brief prepared for him by the Department of Finance. I would say to Senator Cook that the next time he reads a brief from the Department of Finance he should go back and check it carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the sunglasses, he will recall that he was given a brief by the department when in fact the story, as carefully set out in the Auditor-General's report, is quite different from the version he gave. Senator Ray kept on calling out, and one took it from Senator Cook's answer that it was Senator Ray's department. If the Auditor-General could not get hold of the correspondence and could not locate the glasses, then Senator Ray has a particular problem with the various control people in his department. That is a matter for him; it is not a matter for the Auditor-General to be abused about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to flowers, Senator Cook tended to say that the issue related only to the purchase of flowers for an Anzac Day occasion. I refer Senator Cook to page 25 of the Auditor-General's report where at some length it goes through the issue of the purchase of flowers with the credit card by various government departments and agencies. Just to summarise it, for example, it says that some nine per cent of the transactions referred to the Auditor-General for review were purchases of flowers. Flowers were purchased for a number of purposes, including ceremonial, hospitality and for staff. The Auditor-General found much confusion among departments and agencies in determining the appropriateness of the purchase of flowers for staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flowers were given for a number of reasons but not the reasons given to Senator Cook by the Department of Finance&mdash;for retirement or resignation, illness or hospitalisation of staff members, and funerals. The report goes right through another full page outlining the various issues on the purchase of flowers by the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the brief the minister was given by the Department of Finance was a cheap shot. It was a brief which attempted again to mislead people on the nature of the Auditor-General's report. Of course, on some occasions it may well be appropriate to use a credit card. But the Auditor-General, over two pages, outlined the confusion in departments about the use of the credit card for the purchase of flowers and found that on quite a number of occasions these purchases of flowers in no way could be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it that Senator Cook's attempt to answer this question was an accurate reflection of the brief that he was given by the Department of Finance. I suggest that Senator Cook go back to the Minister for Finance and complain that, if people are going to give him briefs on these issues, they should be comprehensive briefs that deal with the issues in a serious fashion and, in particular, the issue found by the Auditor-General in report No. 41, namely, widespread problems, including some fraud, in the use of these credit cards. It would have been a big help if Senator Cook had stood to his feet when he read the brief rather than wait until after question time to try to correct it to show that the government was taking the scandals, as revealed by this particular report, seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply repeat some of the things that I said in answer to the question at question time today. The most significant thing is that there were 184,185 different incidents sterilised for sampling from because they were found to be interesting by the Auditor-General&mdash;that is, after surveying the population of transactions, those that were particularly interesting were taken aside and a sample from them of 1,866 transactions was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not a random sample of the incidence of misuse of credit cards; it is a targeted sample, and getting it in that context is getting it in the right context. That is not to say that there is no concern in the government about misuse of credit cards. That is simply to get the proportions of misuse into a proper context so one can understand the numerical incidence rather than fall prey to a widesweeping allegation which seemed to underpin the questions from the opposition that there is rampant misuse. There is not rampant misuse. But there is misuse that causes the government some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I corrected my answer because, obviously, I have an interest in making sure that what I say in the Senate is accurate. The significant part of the answer is that measures are in place, as we speak, to ensure that credit cards are properly administered by the departments, and the Department of Finance has discharged its obligations by ensuring that all secretaries to departments have had their attention drawn to the proper guidelines and have been requested to make sure that those proper guidelines are observed. Because of some of the observations made in the Auditor-General's report, next month the Department of Finance will issue a best practice guide to credit card use to ensure that the proportionally small number of indiscretions is reduced even further. I think that is again a proper and responsible administrative action by the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those things on the record, it cannot therefore be contended, as was argued in the questions put to me in question time, that the government is somehow derelict in its responsibilities. It is not. When we add to that the fact that the joint public accounts committee is going to examine this issue&mdash;and the minister has, through me, indicated his willingness to accept any further constructive propositions that might come from such an inquiry&mdash;we can see a minister and a department aiming to reduce the amount of improper use and to listen to advice on how it might be reduced further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example of sunglasses has come up and it was referred to in this debate just a moment ago. The sunglasses were a purchase that occurred in the Department of Defence and they were for a detachment of troops being sent to the Sahara Desert.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to the parliamentary handbook of the Department of Human Services and Health.</PARA>
<PARA>I was somewhat surprised by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) appearing not to have a working knowledge of the contents of the Department of Health and Human Services parliamentary handbook, which is described in its introduction as `an important day-to-day reference for all staff of the department.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary handbook covers a wide range of topics, such as ministerial correspondence, briefings, minutes, possible parliamentary questions and other matters relating to the department's responsibility in advising and assisting ministers and the parliamentary secretaries in their parliamentary and ministerial responsibilities. One would imagine that it is not only an invaluable guide for departmental officers but that responsible ministers would be completely familiar with it&mdash;especially since hundreds of copies have apparently been printed and, as it states at the beginning of that handbook, `widely distributed to ensure that everyone has ready access to a copy.' Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have absolutely no evidence that there is any substance to that implied claim by Senator Patterson.</PARA>
<PARA>From her intonation and her demeanour in answering that question it was as though I was casting aspersions on the government that it would have such a highly partisan and biased statement in this parliamentary handbook. I was appalled to learn that this parliamentary handbook contains such a blatantly partisan entry which effectively denies the opposition equal access to information on taxpayer funded initiatives and grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was first alerted to this when a parliamentary colleague of mine from the House of Representatives told me that he had rung the state office of the division of aged care inquiring about recipients of the aged care funding round in his electorate. That information had been withheld from him: he was asked whether he was a Labor or Liberal House of Representatives member and he was told to contact the Labor duty senator for his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I questioned departmental officers about this recently in Senate estimates hearings, I was told that this was not the correct response, that he would not have been denied this information, and that although the information is provided to the duty senator it is also available to anyone else who has a direct interest, and further, no departmental officer had a right to withhold the information. This House of Representatives member could not get that information from the department. It was a calculated response on behalf of the department to my answer and it implied that all senators and members had equal access to the information. I find the answer not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section in the Department of Human Services and Health parliamentary handbook dealing with how funding decisions should be announced expressly instructs departmental officers that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A standard advice letter to the Federal MP or Duty Senator will need to be prepared by the relevant action area for signature by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary. The letter will invite the MP or Senator to notify the beneficiary organisation of the grant and to make use of the attached Media Release. Under no circumstances should advice letters to opposition MPs be prepared.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the answer that I was given, which implied that opposition senators and members have equal access. Moreover, the handbook provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relevant letters to MPs and or Duty Senators should be included with the relevant Media Release attached and with any further details. Duty Senators and Duty MPs are written to when the MP for the electorate to receive funding is not ALP.</PARA>
<PARA>So in marginal seats or in seats that are held by the Liberal Party the duty senator or the duty Labor MP is written to. It is clear from the entries that there is an official departmental policy which effectively ensures that coalition MPs and senators are not notified about Commonwealth grants. This occurs because often duty senators who have been informed about the grants are reluctant to provide information about them to coalition senators and members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of my parliamentary colleagues rang the Department of Human Services and Health for details and they were told to contact their duty senator, because the department could not give them an electoral breakdown. Despite the arguments put forward by my colleagues, they were told that that is what they had to do. One of my colleagues managed to get the information, after some persistence, from the duty senator and the other did not get the information at all. They are not the only examples of this sort of thing happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another example of the Labor Party denying the opposition access to important information about taxpayer funded initiatives. It also illustrates yet further politicisation of the Australian Public Service.

In effect, that is confirmed by the explanation given by Senator Ray to Senator Alston, and we interpret that as the reason given to Nida's relatives for not giving him access to Australia.

The matter presents the government with two issues: firstly, why in relation to Miakhel, it failed to respond to information brought to its attention that he was not a fit and proper person, to put it in the mildest terms; secondly, why it failed to respond to information before it in relation to General Nida that suggested he was not a fit and proper person. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the personal explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to express my concern about the way in which the minister has tabled these documents. Given that he was asked a question about one person and then chose, by way of some smokescreen exercise to pretend that it could be thrown back in our faces&mdash;I think his words were `not just the egg but the whole omelette'&mdash;he was clearly implying that I had been aware that Mohammed Nida had an undesirable history and that I was acting improperly in putting forward a case when I knew or should have known that it was not a frank description of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that I wrote at that time in my capacity as the chairman of the Afghan-Australia Council. It would seem&mdash;having refreshed my memory from the correspondence&mdash;that the person who brought these matters to our mutual attention was Abdul Khaliq Fazal who, as I recall, was a paid up and practising member of the ALP, was a close associate of Lewis Kent, and at one stage sought to join the Liberal Party. As it turned out, and quite wisely I think, we suggested to him that one party was enough. Nonetheless, he obviously made representations upon which we acted in good faith. For my part, I was simply bringing to the attention of the government matters that seemed to be accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I would have thought that the responsibility is squarely on those who have vast resources, in comparison with the opposition, to check out the facts before making a judgment. I am sure that Senator Ray, as a former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, certainly did not take anyone's word for the strength of a case made but took independent advice and certainly relied on his departmental officers to do their homework. In those circumstances, it seems rather strange that, at the very time Senator Bolkus is now trying to nail this on us, Senator Ray's answer&mdash;although in the last sentence it does say, `I should emphasise that UNHCR mandate status alone would not qualify Nida for entry into Australia'&mdash;states in unequivocal terms, `The government is, however, willing to reassess Nida's position should he obtain recognition by UNHCR.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the facts of the matter are that government officers had reason to believe that Nida was certainly not all that he purported to be and, indeed, there were very good security reasons why he should not have been considered, there was no need at all to have gone on with that at least mild form of encouragement. All they needed to say was, `On the material before us, he does not satisfy the necessary guidelines.' Therefore, I would have thought that, at the very least, we are owed an explanation as to not only why the government chose to express itself in what may well be a misleading form but also why Senator Bolkus&mdash;and I must say I am not surprised that Senator Bolkus would do it&mdash;chose to impugn our integrity and besmirch our reputations in the way that he clearly did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all Senator Bolkus is going to say at the end of the day is that he was desperate to avoid answering the question by Senator Short, I can understand his embarrassment. But even that is not a good and proper reason to somehow pretend that we had been caught short, that we had been acting improperly and that, therefore, he did not need to answer the question put to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, my conscience is clear. I might say in passing that I have found the Afghan community in general to be a wonderful collection of people&mdash;very hard working, model citizens for the most part. Overwhelmingly they have settled in very well, and I am proud to have been associated with them. If it transpires that I have been misled, that is unfortunate. But I do not think it can ever be said that I did anything other than make honest representations in good faith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assertions that have been made by opposition senators about what I have said are wrong, and they should check the record when it is printed. I have never said that `you should have known' or that `you acted deceitfully' or `you acted deceptively'. I have not thrown this in as a diversionary tactic. What I have said all along in this matter&mdash;I said it when answering the first question asked in this place&mdash;is that we do have problems with identification and checking in these sorts of circumstances. I was making the point that it is difficult for us in government to ensure comprehensive and totally accurate assessments, just as it is obviously difficult for those opposite to do so. I have not accused those opposite of running a deceitful line to ensure some person got in here wrongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems in terms of identity, allegations and presuming guilt. What the government is not doing in respect of Mr Nida is presuming guilt. Allegations were made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. Those allegations were the basis of questions here and in the estimates committee of the supposed third man. Despite the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report's</EMPHASIS> informant, both the UNHCR and the opposition thought this person was worthy of support. At the end of the day, the migration officer who was involved in this matter also thought this person was worth supporting to come to Australia. It was on that basis that that person was finally allowed entry here. But the point is that, if one is to make a rush to judgment on the basis of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> or media allegations, one can get oneself into trouble. That is precisely the point I was trying to make in respect of this matter. We are awaiting security advice and we are not going to presume guilt. We will ensure that the allegations are pursued comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the specific question about Mr Miakhel, I said at the outset of my answer that there had been six contacts with my office between the date of the letter of May 1993 to somewhere in the middle of June 1994 with respect to us asking the department or referring to the department matters for inquiry. They were not done adequately enough; that has already been established. But the record will show that the contacts between my office and different members of my office staff have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person we are talking about in terms of the third man is someone&mdash;and this record needs to be clarified as well&mdash;about whom Senator Alston made strong representations, someone about whom the president of the association also made strong representations and someone who was initially rejected. He was rejected&mdash;and this is the sentence in the letter that Senator Hill would not read out when he made his short contribution&mdash;by Senator Ray in July 1989 on the following basis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These applications have all been refused by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (in respect of the asylum request), and by myself in respect of the other applications on the basis that he has not established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution or discrimination were he to return to Afghanistan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it was not on a technicality but on the basis at that stage that Foreign Affairs and the relevant officers made an assessment that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray went on to talk about the possibility of migration through other parts of our migration program and rejected any capacity for this person to come in under the family reunion aspect. But the basic point was that the rejection was made on that fear of persecution basis. Then, as Senator Hill rightly pointed out, the minister said that, if the UNHCR made an assessment or a recommendation as to the person's status as a refugee, we would take that into account. The record shows that the person was rejected in 1989. More representations were made on his behalf. I presume they would have come from a number of people, including the opposition. He was accorded refugee status by the UNHCR in New Delhi in September 1989. Then the principal migration officer overseas&mdash;I presume, in New Delhi&mdash;referred the matter to the central office with a recommendation for approval. There was no interference by the minister. It was a recommendation for approval by the migration officer at the post. He did so primarily on the basis of UNHCR recognition of refugee status. As a consequence, this person was accepted under the special humanitarian program on 27 October 1989. The point I make is that&mdash;</PARA>

All I am saying is that in this matter, as with Miakhel, there needs to be exhaustive inquiry. That inquiry was not comprehensive enough in the Miakhel case. That has already been established. But in this particular case, we have had an example of one of those three members which indicates that in this area there are difficulties&mdash;difficulties for the opposition and difficulties for the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments in this discussion as well because the discussion arose in the first instance from a question that I asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, in question time today. Far from Senator Bolkus's assertion in responding to me in question time today that I had egg on my face, all I can say is that everything that I have heard, both in his answer in question time and in his comments just now, seems to me to show a very confused minister who has a lot of egg on his face. But I do not wish to pursue that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to say, though, is that Senator Bolkus seems to be confusing, from everything that he has said in this area, two quite different people. He seems to be confusing the so-called third man who may or may not be Mr Nida. His own departmental staff said in Senate estimates last Thursday that they did not know who the third man was. Obviously Mr Nida is one possibility. I am not going to speculate here on whether he is the third man referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on Monday of last week, but that is one person. The other person, and the person that I was referring to in question time today&mdash;and the minister well knows it&mdash;was someone quite different, someone called Abdul Qadir Miakhel. He was the person that my question was about, and he was the person that most of the questioning and answers were about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry to see Senator Bolkus leave&mdash;in fact I am amazed to see him leave&mdash;because this subject goes to the whole question of Australia's security and to the whole question of the integrity of the migration program. The thing that ought to concern this chamber, and indeed all Australians, is the absolutely incompetent performance of this minister in this portfolio. His performance puts at very serious risk the integrity of Australia's migration program and, worse, the security implications of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the minister in question time today why, for 13 months, he did not follow up the serious allegations that had been made to him about the presence in Australia on a permanent residence basis of the former deputy head of the Najibullah communist regime's brutal secret police force known as the Khad. I also asked him how this person got in and how it was that for 13 months he, as the minister&mdash;he had been the minister for only a month or so when these representations were first brought to his notice&mdash;had failed to follow up the very serious allegations that were made to him concerning Mr Abdul Miakhel. From May 1993 to 22 June, which is last week, he had failed to follow up these allegations. Even then, it was only because the matter had been raised on national television and here in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tabling by Senator Bolkus of three documents&mdash;letters to the then minister, Senator Ray, back in 1989; a letter from each of my colleagues Senator Alston and Senator Hill, and a subsequent press release by Senator Hill&mdash;referred to a totally different case. They referred to the case of Mr Nida who, as we just said, may or may not be the third person referred to last week on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I find it very interesting that the minister was able to table these three documents today which go back to 1989 when last week it appeared that the government was unable to find the letter to Senator Ray in January 1989 from the then president of the Afghan Freedom League, a Mr Besodi, which first drew attention to the problems of possible entry into Australia and the background of Mr Miakhel. Nor last week could it find Senator Ray's response five months later to Mr Besodi expressing concern about the matter and saying that the various relevant posts would have been notified to act on that information if in fact Mr Miakhel made application or if application was made on his behalf to enter Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all unanswered questions which I raised last week in Senate estimates, and they are partly the basis of my question today. But the point I want to make is that in his response today Senator Bolkus was referring to a totally different person, namely Mr Nida, rather than the person who was the basis of my question, Mr Miakhel. In doing so, he deliberately misled the Senate, I must say, by tabling correspondence relating to a different case and by attempting to portray what I was asking him as something of almost no consequence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record some comments that were made during the Senate estimates consideration of this matter last Thursday, 23 June. At that Senate estimates hearing last week both the minister and his department admitted that they had, to use the minister's own words&mdash;I cannot find them in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> but he used them because they were later reported, and no-one has questioned them&mdash;stuffed up on this particular case of Mr Miakhel. I will read a few excerpts from page 231 through to page 235 of Estimates Committee F of 23 June. Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am just confirming the dates. He advised that it had been referred to the department for investigation. I am further advised by the department that the matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the investigation of allegations about Mr Miakhel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was not pursued until quite recently.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also asked for a report on why little action was taken since my senior adviser replied to Mr Besodi. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a period of almost one year. In response to my further questioning as to when he got on to his department again about this matter, Senator Bolkus admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a busy 24 hours, but I think it was yesterday sometime.</PARA>
<PARA>That is within the last 24 hours; therefore it was on 22 June&mdash;10 months after he had asked the department for an investigation into this matter. There were several other points of confirmation in relation to that. Then the deputy secretary of the department, Mr Richardson, in response to further questioning, commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no escaping the fact that the department has not performed well on that issue; the department has clearly failed in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Richardson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The department did not respond adequately in August.</PARA>
<PARA>That was at the time when the minister responded to representations he received three months earlier. Those representations had sat in his office from May 1993 through August, despite the fact that his senior adviser had apparently referred to the allegations as `serious'. So there was a three-month delay in the minister's office before the allegations were referred to the department for investigation in August. The deputy secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The department did not respond adequately in August.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in response to an additional letter on the matter that had come in from the Afghan community in October, Mr Richardson said;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, when the additional letter came in October, it did not respond adequately again.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, to cap off all that, finally, the secretary of the department, Mr Conybeare&mdash;who I must say had sat there throughout these hearings and had let the deputy secretary, Mr Richardson, do virtually all of the answering&mdash;in response to a specific question of mine, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the department has fallen down on the job.</PARA>
<PARA>It was on the basis of those admissions by the department last week that I accused both the minister and the department of a gross dereliction of duty. I would have to say that the performance by Senator Bolkus here today, when he tried totally to divert attention from this case and to refer to another case but somehow or other purported to run the two together, was not only a gross dereliction of duty but also a gross misconduct on a minister's part. That is why I asked him in my supplementary question today why he let an investigation into this matter run for more than a year, without following up any response to the investigation that he himself had apparently put in train. Those are grounds, in my view, for a minister to very seriously consider resigning because they demonstrate a total lack of competence on the part of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like the minister to do, and what I would think the Australian electorate would expect the minister to do, would be to come into this chamber and tell the Senate and, through the Senate, the Australian public just what went wrong and why he failed to carry out his ministerial duties. Until such time as Senator Bolkus does that, he will stand condemned for a failure to carry out his ministerial responsibilities adequately and competently. I was going to say that for him today to attempt to divert all attention away from this issue is very regrettable&mdash;but it is much more serious than that. I hope that the minister may by now have realised the seriousness of his actions and will respond a little more seriously as soon as he has had a chance to consider this as fully as he should have. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first case is the one that Senator Short has mentioned, Abdul Miakhel. The implication was that I was warned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inference in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, but even more, in the newspapers afterwards, was that I had been warned&mdash;by implication, the department; it was not the opposition that had said that but the department&mdash;and somehow I had let him in. It just simply was not true. My only involvement was to send the warning on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone thinks, `If there is a warning about someone, he or she should not be in this country,' that person should not think that an immigration minister gets one of those warnings a week or even 10 a week. An immigration minister can get 100 warnings a week. As an immigration minister, one has to wade through the true ones and the false ones and the ones that are made for all sorts of reasons. So that was the first particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill only put half the proposition in respect of General Nida, and Senator Bolkus was right to say he should have read the lot out. Because when he referred to the balance of family, that was under the normal migration program; it was not a technical excuse. General Nida could have applied to come to this country on one of two grounds, as a refugee or as an immigrant. The latter half of the letter that was quoted ruled him out on a technicality as a normal immigrant for family reunion. All honourable senators would know that the balance of family was introduced at the beginning of 1989 and, in fact, he did not qualify under that&mdash;that was the last part of the letter. But the actual reason for his initial rejection had nothing to do with his being a `possible' war criminal. It was to do with the fact that he had not been classified as a refugee because he did not qualify under the UNHCR qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that UNHCR was going to review that, therefore, he would be declared a refugee, he would have a family in Australia and we have a long history of helping Afghani refugees. I mention for the record that Senator Alston's role in this was always a positive one. I think he brought delegations to see me on at least two occasions to ask, indeed, that we bring in more people, and we used to bring in about 200 to 300 a year. So he was accepted on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can state categorically that I had no knowledge, and no knowledge was passed on to me, that there were any queries about General Nida. It is interesting that the Afghan Council of Victoria, which keeps in fairly regular contact with New South Wales, supported General Nida's coming here. The point that Senator Bolkus is making today is that it is not easy to make judgments on these matters. Should we have accepted the advice of the Afghan refugee council on the case and not the other? What was its state of knowledge of that? Probably as confused as everyone else's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as an issue, this has evolved in a typical, high principled way but it has come down to sleazy politics. The bane of my life as immigration minister was the politics of the immigration debate and ethnic affairs. One could never absolutely clear away who was running arguments on the basis of principle and who was arguing just for political gain. And I am not, by the way, in any way pointing the finger opposite. In making that particular statement, I have to point both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Bolkus was saying today is that these matters are not clear-cut. It is quite possible that these Afghan refugee councils could give advice which, in one case, may prove to be right and, in another case, may prove to be wrong. For those opposite to sit there as the judges and juries in all these cases trying to make a bit of snide political capital out of it is not necessarily the most consistent thing they have ever done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short was quite right to read out extracts from the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Mr Richardson's evidence that shows that the department did, as Senator Short said, `stuff up'. Those things happen. That is why there are rubbers on the end of pencils. I could, I suppose, if I want to be very abrasive, go back to some of the characters that were let into Australia in the early 1950s to show that even under Liberal governments processes did not all work. That is why we have had a Nazi deported from the United States back to Australia just this year. People do slip through the nets. What Senator Bolkus said is that anyone who has slipped through the net under the guise of a refugee will be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to those opposite that if they want us to go back and look at some of the characters who came in under the Fraser government from one particular country&mdash;some honourable senators opposite will know who I am talking about; they thought, because it was behind the iron curtain, these people were all refugees&mdash;they will see that we took in some of the worst criminals in the history of this country. The opposition will live to regret that particular debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accidents do occur in one or two of these cases and, as Senator Bolkus was right to say, they are not yet established in total proof. There are doubts about at least two or maybe three of these people having got into this country as refugees. It was not as though the department did not try in one case and may have made a mistake in another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in summary that I have been a bit disappointed by the way the press have covered this matter. They have rolled the three cases together. They have carried that statement implying that I was warned on all three cases, which was not the fact. The major implication that people would have taken is that I was warned by the department, which was not the case. We received one letter of warning which we properly processed and sent on. I notice those who want to speak on the matter of public importance are getting a bit impatient, so I will wind up on that note. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some people have called it sports rorts. There was a justified call for more stringent procedures to ensure accountability of public moneys when they were expended by the government. As part of this the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, in the chamber on 3 March detailed an accountability package. I indicated that, as well as that accountability package, the government should consider supporting the motion for file lists to be tabled in the Senate. Senator Evans on that day gave that assurance, subject to further consideration and details, to ensure that it was properly implemented. Further discussions have taken place. The result is the motion I have now moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is to ensure that there be some lead time for departments in being able to fulfil the original motion which sought to have the full file lists tabled in the parliament. The motion, as now proposed, seeks to have those lists relating to files that have been established in the last six months, tabled in the parliament twice per year. There is a cut-off date. Between now and that cut-off date, presumably, there will be sufficient time to review how the system is working. It will not be only new files, but parts of existing files that will be required to be tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the lead time will enable departments to examine the method by which they deal with these questions. We are urging the departments to have the file lists tabled in electronic form so they can be easily accessed by the various members of parliament and by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the proposal I am moving will make FOI more genuinely workable by enabling parliamentarians and the public to have some idea what information exists. The motion was also intended to do more than simply make things easy for persons requesting information under the Freedom of Information Act. It is designed to make coordination within the bureaucracy easier as well as ensuring that both ministers and members of parliament can get a real benefit out of the vast expenditure on information technology being undertaken by the Commonwealth departments. Because there is a motion to have this matter referred to a committee and because the Senate today has been delayed in a manner that was not envisaged, I seek leave to have the rest of my speech incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than getting lost in technical detail it may be helpful to Honourable Senators if I explain the broad background for the motion. Some years ago Parliament passed the Freedom of Information Act, an initiative of which Senator Evans was quite supportive. If I may quote from the Foreword Senator Evans wrote as Attorney-General to Peter Bayne's book on Freedom of Information, the aims of FOI legislation include "wider dissemination of information gathered at the public expense on topics such as product safety, engineering feasibility, environmental hazards and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third [aim], and perhaps the most important of all, is to improve the quality of decision-making in the public sector&mdash;both by keeping people informed of the workings of the decision-making process in policy formulation and administration, and by throwing the spotlight of public scrutiny on Government mistakes in the past to ensure that they are not repeated in the future."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic principle behind freedom of information is that what is produced and collected with taxpayers' money should be available to taxpayers. However, as time has gone by, a major problem has emerged with the Freedom of Information Act in that search and retrieval costs may prove very expensive to applicants. This is because applicants have no way of knowing what files they should be asking for. They are left to frame their requests in a general void without any detailed knowledge of what files may be available. This naturally raises the costs of accessing information. Senators will be aware there have been complaints that FOI applicants are being charged for Departmental inefficiencies in information management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator Evans declared in this Chamber on 8 April 1981 "Good freedom of information legislation&mdash;legislation which is genuinely worthy of that name&mdash;must satisfy a number of characteristics. For a start, it must ensure that a maximum amount of publicity is made available as to what kind of information will actually be available under the Bill and how access to it can be obtained in practice. It is all very well to have elaborate procedures technically available, but if at the very threshold considerations militate against a person knowing how to utilise those procedures, then they may not be worth having. Next, good freedom of information legislation is that which would set a minimum of procedural obstacles by way of delay or complexity or cost, and afford the maximum of practical assistance to those who are pressing requests for access to information. Again, such legislation would contain an absolute minimum of exceptions and exemptions."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to efficient information retrieval is proper filing and file lists. Departmental file lists are already subject to FOI. Any news media organisation could request them under FOI. But the cost to a member of the public could be large in some cases. As Senator Evans observed on 8 April 1981 "One of the nicest descriptions of the general public policy role of freedom of information legislation is that its object is to make the outsiders in the political process insiders, to put them, in effect, in the same position as those who have access to this system by virtue of privilege, commercial position or things of that kind."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So this motion is designed to make FOI more genuinely workable, by enabling Parliamentarians and the public to have some idea of what information exists. However the motion is also intended to do more than simply make things easy for persons requesting information under the Freedom from Information Act. It is designed to make co-ordination within the bureaucracy easier as well as ensuring that both Ministers and Parliamentarians can get a real benefit out of the vast expenditure on information technology being undertaken by Commonwealth Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much has been said in recent years about reforming the Public Service. Unfortunately in all this process of reform the need to protect the institutional memory of the Civil Service has been neglected. Increasing staff turnover and amalgamation or abolition of Departments has weakened the ability of both the bureaucracy and Parliament to maintain their institutional memories of policy development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, I have recently had the experience that serious undertakings given to me in 1988 by a Minister about the administration of legislation have been dishonoured, not necessarily from any wish to do so on the part of a Minister but simply because the relevant Department lacked sufficient institutional memory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although many Departments have indicated they could provide the information without much additional expense or trouble, others have suggested that it may involve additional resources. There are several possible responses to that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, Senators will recall that exaggerated claims of undue expense were made at the time Freedom of Information was being discussed. Indeed Senator Evans in his speech of 8 April 1981 said the 1981 Bill fell over backwards in its attempt to avoid placing any extra demands on the Public Service. He also commented adversely on the "extravagant and overblown claims of the resource implications" of proposed FOI amendments. In the event, the Public Service survived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, one may ask why should there be much additional expense, if Departments are being efficiently run and keeping their files in good order. The major item of expense could only be in excising titles or parts of titles which should remain confidential. That involves time and this motion grants plenty of time to do it. Obviously a file with the title "Bill Smith&mdash;Bass Strait Transport" is not a confidential title; a file with the title "Bill Smith&mdash;request for visa to Timbuctoo" relates to private matters. So I recognise that Departments will have to exercise bona fide judgment and should have time to get their file lists in order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, I note that even if the additional costs are taken at face value&mdash;and I don't&mdash;it is a very small amount when set against departmental running costs of about $12,000 million. Indeed any additional expenditure may well be seen as a worthwhile investment in ensuring proper administration and avoidance of duplicated effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective administration requires that officers of the public service keep and maintain efficiently proper records of matters they deal with. It is simply no good to have cupboards full of unsorted papers. Files must be created, logically named and classified, folioed and kept up to date. If that is not done, time and money are wasted by Departmental duplication of research or, even worse, Departments can be working at cross purposes in mutual ignorance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, this very necessary and vital process of proper record keeping appears to have been neglected in the process of public service "reform", change or whatever one prefers to call it. The consequences of this neglect can be serious. To take one example, a former officer in Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr William Bush, in a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration documented inadequate record keeping in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He pointed out the costs of this neglect in terms of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">failure to meet the need to have access to background information in dealing with current international issues;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to compensate for the loss of institutional memory caused by high staff mobility;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to be able to refer to past practice in determining Australia's position under international law;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the costs incurred in one-off large archival searches from time to time (eg in litigation);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">unnecessarily large costs in meeting FOI requests; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">additional costs in preparing files for transfer to the Australian Archives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If files are not properly maintained and sensible file lists not made up Australia can be disadvantaged. For example, in international negotiations another country might well refer to a position taken by Australia in 1957 in treaty negotiations. If that information has been lost in the system here in Australia it puts us at a negotiating disadvantage. As Mr Bush observes, there is nothing more damaging in a negotiation than to be confronted unawares with an Australian statement contrary to the position Australia is seeking to argue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, I am not much impressed by arguments that it is too costly for the Public Service to be efficient and do what it should be doing anyway&mdash;keeping well-maintained file lists. It is in the long run much more costly for Departments to neglect proper file administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But more important than even the proper administration of the Executive government of the day is the right of Parliament to know. The role of Parliament and its right to information must be respected. Parliamentarians ask questions on policy and specific matters relating to the administration of public policy that are important to their constituents. In Estimates Committees and by other means we try to ensure that Ministers and their Departments are accountable to taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Parliament however to properly discharge its duty of scrutiny it too needs to use information technology efficiently. Some time ago when negotiations were being conducted to allow Departments access to the Parliamentary Database system I wrote to the former President indicating my view that information exchange needed to be a two way street and this motion is really a development of that thought. Parliament needs access to Departmental file lists if it is to follow in an intelligent way the workings of policy development and make the most efficient use of its power to examine Departments in Estimates Committees or ask Ministers questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That said, I see this motion as essentially advancing the interests of all parties. A full compendium of public service file lists will enable better Departmental use of resources, better inter-Departmental co-ordination, better Ministerial scrutiny of their Departments, more informed Parliamentary scrutiny and last, but not least, better public access to information for the taxpayers of this country who pay for it all. I recognise that there may be some nervousness in the Executive about this motion. Any such nervousness should be allayed by a consideration of the advantages to good executive government itself of such a comprehensive file listing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to move an amendment to Senator Harradine's motion in the terms circulated in the chamber. I want to say at the outset that the coalition is very supportive of the intention of Senator Harradine's motion. A quick glance at the detail of our amendment indicates that we are not in any way trying to stop his motion. In fact, if our amendment is successful, come what may on 1 September this year, Senator Harradine's motion will be in effect. Irrespective of what a committee investigation says, this motion will take effect on 1 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do think it is appropriate that the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration have the opportunity to look at this motion and see whether it can improve on the work that has already been done by Senator Harradine and some members of the government towards achieving the end that they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first paragraph of the amendment basically details that, indicating the good faith that we have indicated to Senator Harradine. We are not trying to stop this motion. It will come into effect either on 1 September or on the day this Senate adopts a resolution of the committee. One or the other will have to take place; and whichever comes earlier will take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second paragraph of our amendment indicates what we want the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to look at. The first thing we want it to look at is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the order will produce material which is in a user-friendly form for Senators and others.</PARA>
<PARA>We have some apprehension that piles and piles of material, in electronic form or otherwise, that is not user-friendly will arrive. That would somewhat defeat the purpose of the information being provided. We all see that in the provision of information to estimates committees; the answers come at the last minute, on the death knell. The answers are not sorted or indexed. They are just piled in with a whole lot of others. We see it in the provision of annual reports that have to be provided within a certain number of days of the estimates committees. Sure enough, out come the drafts, and a speed reader can get through a pile of reports overnight, but anyone who is not a speed reader has Buckley's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So just providing the information in form is not good enough. We think this is a good enough idea to ensure that the information is provided in a user-friendly form. Some of the other things we want to look at are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the practicality of implementing the order;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the cost of carrying out the order;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the implications of the order for Commonwealth Departments; </PARA>
<PARA>We also need to look at whether there is another more efficient and effective way to achieve the same aim. So we are not in any way opposed to the intent of what Senator Harradine wants to achieve. We are strongly supportive of any initiatives to improve the accountability of the executive to this parliament. We just want to make the point that for ideals to become reality, a lot of hard work has to take place. Someone has to have an idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case it was Senator Harradine who had the idea that it would be easier for the general community and, in particular, for us to have an idea what the government was doing if we could see what the file headings were. It was a good idea and he has been refining it, with a bit of argy-bargy with Senator Evans. Now it comes to the time to try to put that idea, somewhat refined, into practice. We are keen to do that. We want to put the idea into its most practical form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that by the finance and public administration committee having a good look at it, this should put it in a cost-efficient form for the public sector, if it is not already&mdash;it may well be&mdash;and in a user-friendly form for parliamentarians and the public. Senator Evans is fond of a phrase that could be used in relation to Senator Harradine's motion&mdash;that is, `suck it and see'. The thought is, `Why don't we just pass the motion and see what happens&mdash;we can always amend it later.' But we are doing that all the time in this place&mdash;passing bills and amending them later; passing motions and amending them later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think, by and large, `suck it and see' is a sensible approach if we have done everything we can to make the confection as palatable as possible in the first place. That is all we want to do: get this chamber, through one of its committees, to exercise a responsible approach to this, have a good look at it, and come back and see whether the intention of Senator Harradine's motion can be further refined in a more practical and cost-efficient way than it already has been.

I am very pleased to see that two of my colleagues who are members of that committee are supporting me today. I think the taxpayers of Australia have every right to ask the question: where is this government going with its wasteful administration?

That prompted me today to put this particular matter of public importance forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the waste and extravagance in this country that has been overseen by this government, we have to start at the top. I think we should take a cursory look at the Lodge. With the indulgence of the Senate, I remind senators and the taxpayers of Australia what has been spent on the Lodge in the last year or so: the John Gould bird prints that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had a bit to do with cost $84,800; two cushions for the Lodge, $719; plans for the Lodge driveway, $100,000; lights for the Lodge dining room, $8,250; upgrade of the Lodge carport, $260,000; upgrade of the Lodge family room, $24,000; a billiard table for the Lodge, $14,300; an upgrade of the Lodge pool and patio area, $217,000; the Lodge dining room table, $25,000; and the Lodge dining room chairs, $24,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not all, but these items total some $758,000 and this has all been done at a time when the taxpayers and workers of Australia have been forced to sell their homes, to move into rented accommodation and to live on the streets during this recession that we had to have. I do not know what is going on at the Lodge. With all of these things being done to the Lodge, I do not know whether it is being turned into a Swiss chalet or whether it is just the fact that our Prime Minister has to tough it out and live at the `arse end of the world'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that was tabled yesterday which prompted me to bring this particular matter forward highlights some quite alarming and extravagant uses of government money. At the end of the day, one always has to go back to the ministers responsible. It was no accident today&mdash;this surprised me of course, considering that the Auditor-General in audit report No. 21, which was brought down in December last year, drew the government's attention to examples of waste and extravagance in the use of the Australian government credit card&mdash;that the minister in his answer to my question said that the government had changed the rules and put guidelines in place last July. In fact, it was an incorrect answer and he had to correct himself later by saying they would be put in place next July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would one not have thought that, with the Auditor-General having brought forward these concerns last December, the government would have moved with a little more haste to stop the quite extravagant misuse of taxpayers' money with this credit card? But, no, we had to again read examples such as golf coaching for 30 staff members who, the report said, spent this money as a way of emphasising the place of recreation in health and to demonstrate to the managers their capacity to learn a new skill. I just wonder whether these staff used the promotional golf balls that, as I highlighted the other week, Purchasing Australia purchased at a cost of some $5,600 and handed out to all its mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks through this report one could, on behalf of taxpayers, question the thousands of dollars that were spent on restocking drinks cabinets. There were varying amounts for various departments. The Auditor-General felt that some of those issues needed far more detailed analysis. Quoting one particular case as an example, the Auditor-General said that five staff went to a restaurant for a lunch which cost $205 and the officer interviewed could not outline what benefit was gained from that lunch. These are just little snippets that we pick out from time to time. When one considers the amount of transactions that are conducted with this government credit card, the mind must boggle. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking through the recent three-month project audit that was done, I must say that the Auditor-General was really putting only his toe in the water.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember last year highlighting in this place some other larger amounts of money that had been wasted by this government through poor management. I recall the Attorney-General's Department as one of the major offenders. It spent $17.5 million on a computer system called the National Legal Office Information System, nicknamed LOIS.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert has made a good effort at producing a case in a very difficult area in one sense but an easy area in another sense. It is a difficult area in the sense that it is hard to come up with any new ideas or new concepts that are aimed at taking a debate such as this by the throat and making something of it. It is easy to come up with sums of money which may or may not mean something depending on the context in which they are put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert in his remarks instanced the Lodge and mentioned items such as dining room tables, billiard tables, plants and so on. He then claims that such expenditure is extravagant without putting the matter into context. The Lodge is a place that is of great significance to the way Australia conducts its business and its government. There could be examples of extravagance in the Lodge, but expenditure cannot be made to seem extravagant by an honourable senator simply saying that such and such a sum has been spent and then leaving the matter there. He or she has to explain why such expenditure is extravagant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert obviously has been going around getting little snippets of information. He is hoping to get on to an issue that will run if broadcast and something that people can pick up and say `Oh, that sounds bad' and off the issue goes. But in my view such an approach does not get down to getting something done with what is alleged to be wrong. It is difficult to work out what is wrong. Clearly somebody who steals $1.76 million has done something wrong, and that is a matter to which Senator Calvert drew attention and of course it should be remarked upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in other areas Senator Calvert has experienced difficulty in proving his case. Let us take, for example, the question of government credit cards. We see in the Auditor-General's report No. 41:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of misuse of the Australian government credit card, identified during the audit work supporting Audit Report No. 21, was extremely low when compared with the total value and number of transactions. However, as noted in that report, "this must be qualified because inadequate control systems and ineffective reporting mean the full extent of misuse is not known".</PARA>
<PARA>Any misuse is bad, but on the other hand against that background it is another matter to claim that there is a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of where things can go quite wrong is contained in the example given in the report by John Taylor, the Auditor-General, relating to the Department of Defence. Report No. 41, which was tabled yesterday on purchases by use of the AGCC, mentioned a case study concerning the purchase of sunglasses and wristwatches. Those items were required for a United Nations sponsored deployment of Australian troops in the Western Sahara giving communication support for a forthcoming referendum. The item of wristwatches just left in the air, with no further explanation, might sound a little unusual, but when one examines the context in which those wristwatches were purchased one accepts the item more readily. Indeed, one would have to praise the fact that they were supplied in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from the report that the items were purchased as previous experience had shown there was a need to provide personnel with quality accessories because of the harsh conditions. When the detachment returned from duty in the Western Sahara, the items were withdrawn from issue and are now located in an army supply company store at Randwick. That is an example of what I mean by describing the full circumstances in which particular events take place. Simply to throw such items in the air, whether they be from the Lodge, the army or any other department, does not take the matter any further until the circumstances are set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office had written to Defence seeking comment on the matters raised in the draft report, including the purchase of sunglasses and wristwatches. In relation to the subject purchases, Defence responded essentially along the lines that I have outlined. Other documents were also made available to ANAO staff. Despite all this, the Auditor-General has, for reasons unknown, decided to report the purchases in an extremely mischievous manner. Defence has endeavoured to assist the Auditor-General throughout the investigations where particular matters have been brought to the attention of the department. It is of great concern to Defence when, having been asked to comment on matters raised, the advice submitted was ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set out these matters because they illustrate what is required when this chamber debates matters of this sort. It is easy to get up in this place and to quote figures and mention types of goods and then leave the whole matter in the air. It is easy to give the impression that something bad has been going on. But when one takes such examples and puts them in context, the story takes on a very different meaning. I repeat that it is unfortunate that particular items are quoted in debate and are taken quite out of context.

Whilst the department has gone through some difficult adjustments to its staffing profile, I have no doubt that DAS's pursuit of a commercialisation model has made it a more effective business operation. Its business planning processes and financial information systems have been developed to provide an effective management control and accountability framework. The department's goals are clear and unambiguous, and its progress towards them is tracked regularly by DAS and ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quickly respond to two things. Senator Cooney basically gave an absolutely glowing reference to the commercialisation process in DAS. Clearly, he did not read this morning's papers where there was a report on one of DAS's biggest businesses, the Australian Construction Service, with which Senator Bolkus will be quite familiar. The report said that the ACS was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . inward-looking and plagued with productivity problems . . . a parochial, fear-driven autocracy . . . suffers from factionalism, leadership which is perceived to be weak and aloof, and lack of direction. The staff are punch-drunk.</PARA>
<PARA>That is part of DAS's reforms over the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney was referring to a report by the Auditor-General which was tabled yesterday. Senator Calvert was referring to a litany of waste, mismanagement and extravagance by this Labor government that has cost Australian taxpayers enormously. In the short time available to me I want to reveal some of the even bigger ticket items. It will not be confetti, as Senator Cooney said; it will be surface-to-air missiles. My staff researched this morning&mdash;and this is what I have uncovered in the last three years&mdash;that it adds up to nearly $1.5 billion in identifiable waste, almost down to the last decimal point. This is taxpayers' money spent by this government; money taken out of the hands of homeless youth; money taken out of the hands of business people; money taken out of the hands of Australian taxpayers. This money has been flushed down the toilet called the Australian Labor government. It has been flushed down the toilet, never to be seen again. It is just wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spend a couple of minutes identifying some of that waste. We have identified $250 million annually in wasted office space by the federal government. The federal government occupies the equivalent of something like 50 Melbourne Cricket Grounds&mdash;something I know you are interested in, Mr Acting Deputy President, after hearing your question at question time today. If we apply private sector office space usage rates, the amount of space that is wasted is the equivalent of 693,000 square metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus and the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker, will argue over methodology and other ways to determine that figure, but the cold, hard fact is that if the government used space efficiently it could save $250 million a year. I do not say that the government could solve that problem in one year. To make the federal government use office space efficiently would probably take 10 or 15 years of reform. The trouble is that this government has not even taken the first step, as witnessed by what we uncovered with the Casselden Place scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This building was constructed while Senator Bolkus was the minister. This matter is currently the subject of an Auditor-General's inquiry. Casselden Place did not need to be built. In fact, if it had been knocked over halfway through construction it would have saved the taxpayers&mdash;and I am sure the Auditor-General's report will bear this out&mdash;around about $300 million. In other words, all the public servants who work in Casselden Place could be put in other buildings in Melbourne. We could have made a park of the site; perhaps a monument to Prime Minister Paul Keating or former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The Australian taxpayers would have been $300 million better off. We will await the outcome of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next piece of waste inefficiency that we uncovered earlier this year concerned the leasing of cars by the Department of Administrative Services vehicle leasing company called Dasfleet to the Transport Workers Union. On the admission of the minister, Mr Walker, the department was providing airconditioned executive style cars&mdash;Ford Fairmonts&mdash;to trade union officials. I drive a Dasfleet Ford Fairmont myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These cars are provided at a rate of less than $400 a month. They are fully maintained, fully serviced, and replaced after two years. If the cars break down on the side of the road they are replaced. Not many transport workers actually get the cars; it is the bosses of the union who are doing very well while the workers suffer in the recession. These cars are provided at rates that are hundreds of dollars a month less than anyone else would receive; in fact, less than what a transport worker could get for himself. The loss to the taxpayer in lost tax on this deal was $250,000 in 18 months. The losses in the subsidy add up to another $250,000 a year. So we have $500,000 a year involved in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other matter I wish to refer to is Centenary House, which again is the subject of an inquiry. I guess the judicial inquiry will prove beyond any doubt that the taxpayer is paying in the realm of at least $14 million over the next 15 years&mdash;that is $1 million a year&mdash;too much rent. Regardless of where the money goes&mdash;even if it happens to go to the Australian Labor Party&mdash;it is more waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have identified nearly $1.5 billion of waste by this Labor government. What is the effect of that? We are going to hear from Senator Carr shortly. He is a well renowned activist on the Left of the Labor Party who believes fervently in social justice. I will be interested to see how he defends the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might rely on a couple of quotes from international people. When taxpayers' money is wasted in this way, it is money that firstly has to be taken from people by way of tax. It is a cost to private individuals who may create employment opportunities. It is money that is not available to the government to redistribute to those in need. In 1984, Roger Douglas, a former New Zealand finance minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Government in particular finds it hard to face the fact that public sector waste hurts low-income people most of all. It obviously reduces the resources available to them. It also reduces the number of jobs the economy should be able to offer them. To take an extra $1 from the private sector and put it in the public sector costs more than $1&mdash;something between $1.20 and $3. Those extra cents are known as `dead weight loss'. Then, unless the money is used in the public sector at least as productively as it would have been in the private sector, its effectiveness is decreased further.</PARA>
<PARA>When we take money from the private sector and flush it down the toilet, it is not used effectively at all. My last quotation is from David Stockwood in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Triumph of Politics</EMPHASIS>. He talks about his campaign for a seat in the Congress and he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My encounters with the workaday citizens of southern Michigan had a profound effect on my quest for ideological truth. More than anything else, I was struck by the dramatic contrast between how hard and with what care, pride and discipline the nation's citizens worked to earn our national income and wealth on the one hand, and the feckless, inconsistent and muddled manner in which it was shunted around the halls of Washington on the other. To be sure, I had long since turned against the pernicious projects of government as an intellectual matter, but now an emotional layer was grafted onto the case.</PARA>
<PARA>Waste by this Labor government has cost low income earners in terms of their lifestyle, and everyone else in terms of the taxes they need not be paying to this wasteful and extravagant Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I am opposed to the terms in which Senator Calvert has raised this matter of public importance. In the course of the debate I was asked by Senator Campbell how I would go about defending the indefensible. In a situation such as this we have to look at the credentials of those making the allegations of waste and mismanagement by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What strikes me as particularly gruelling, given the claims that have been made, is that at the last election the coalition went to the people of this country and argued for a $10 billion cut to the public sector. The coalition said that a series of services and benefits should be taken away from the people. In a draconian and callous way, the coalition suggested that the services provided to the people of this country by the Commonwealth&mdash;services which go a long way to ensuring that there is fairness and balance in the distribution of resources&mdash;should be taken away. It was making those claims in areas such as social security, education and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it surprise those opposite if I said that I did not agree with their talk about waste and mismanagement and their claim that their approach is superior to that of the Labor Party? I have to say that the approach they have taken is essentially geared towards defence of their mates in the private sector. When we talk about the leasing of buildings by government or about the services being provided by the government to the private sector, we have to ask for whose benefit that occurs. For instance, what is the coalition's proposal with regard to rent assistance for Commonwealth departments seeking accommodation? It proposes that the landlords of this country should enjoy the benefits of public sector patronage. It does not want the normal processes of accountability because it sees that as undermining commercial, market driven processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raising of this matter of public importance is a silly attempt by the so-called waste watch committee of the coalition to demonstrate that this government has not spent the resources of the people of this country properly. I reject that proposition and the coalition's motives in raising it should be challenged. There is no fairness in the coalition's approach. It does not recognise that DAS has seen considerable changes in recent times which have led to considerable improvement in the delivery of services: improvements in productivity of between five and six per cent in 1986-87; a reduction in real terms in the annual operating costs of various businesses of $300 million; a rise in generated profits from $4.4 million in 1991-92 to $16 million in 1992-93; and improvement in the quality of service and responsiveness to customer needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would expect that, in drawing attention to the way in which the Auditor-General has referred to the misuse of the government credit card, the coalition would at least recognise what the Auditor-General actually said. The Auditor-General found that the extent of misuse of the credit card identified during audit work was extremely low when compared with the total value in a number of transactions. He added that he supports the continued use of the credit card. Those opposite should be fair in their approach to this question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on a matter of public importance to support my colleagues Senator Calvert and Senator Campbell. I could not help noticing that Senator Carr never really tried to defend this government's waste. His only defence was to suggest that the coalition's policies might somehow reduce the amount of money available. That has nothing to do with the amount of waste and mismanagement that has gone on under this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney accused Senator Calvert of picking out snippets, and suggested that doing so achieved nothing. In case those opposite think that the waste watch committee is achieving nothing, I can tell them that the committee found out about a welfare loophole through which the government was allowing millions of dollars in welfare benefits to be paid to the families of workers overseas who were earning large salaries. Although the government eventually responded, the situation was allowed to go unchecked for many years. It was only because it was raised by the waste watch committee as a particular waste by this government of taxpayers' money that the government eventually took action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr shows himself for what he really is when, instead of trying to defend the actions of his government, he says that all we have are ideas about cutting back on funding. In the example of waste I just referred to, the additional family payment that was paid in the name of the wife and added to the child endowment was based on Australian taxable income alone. As a result, the government made social security payments to families of overseas workers of upwards of $90,000 a year. That situation was made worse by the fact that the recipients did not need to be Australian citizens. There were instances where families of New Zealand workers employed in Papua New Guinea were claiming between $400 and $1,200 a month in family payments from Australian taxpayers. It is only because this was highlighted by the waste watch committee that the government responded and took action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about government waste and whether government spending is justified, members of the government would do well to read the guidelines for use of the Australian government credit card issued by the Australian Taxation Office. I mentioned these guidelines yesterday. The holders of these cards are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You should exercise extreme care in deciding what to spend public funds on. You should constantly be asking yourself "what would a member of the public think about this expenditure?"</PARA>
<PARA>I can tell Senator Carr and Senator Burns&mdash;who will be speaking later&mdash;that I know what the public thinks about this expenditure. That is why so many of these cases are raised with the waste watch committee and why so many people are annoyed, to say the very least, by the continued waste and mismanagement by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a couple of examples highlighted last year  of where funds were wasted on what most members of the public would not consider to be worthwhile expenditure. The government used taxpayers' funds to promote its own form of sexual agenda. The list of recipients of taxpayer funded handouts was considerable. It included gays; lesbians; homosexuals; transsexuals; bisexuals; and prostitutes, both male and female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give examples of where I believe that the government has completely abandoned any sense of moral decency in its quest to gain electoral support. There was $54,000 given by this government for a project commissioned by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to conduct a needs analysis of the transsexual population in Australia; there was $188,000 to conduct a needs assessment of female partners of bisexual men and to implement the recommendations; there was over $1 million to a so-called student health group which advocated to its members student prostitution as a means of funding tertiary education; and then, of course, there was the infamous case of $6,000 being allocated to some of Canberra's prostitutes for a video script. If that is considered by the general public to be worthwhile and justifiable spending by an Australian government, then I think the general public must have many unfulfilled expectations as to the way government money should be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight another example of a major expenditure. In just over 10 months a government department spent over $4 million on chairs alone. This averages something like $130,000 a week being spent on chairs by this government. In 10 months the total cost of furniture purchased by the Australian Public Service was over $22 million&mdash;nearly $850,000 a week on furniture and chairs. </PARA>

The pool table was purchased for the staff amenities area of the department's Brisbane office in the AMP Building in Eagle Street. The department defended this purchase by saying that its staff operated in close contact with veterans and therefore needed to have a strong team atmosphere. If a strong team atmosphere has to be developed by playing pool on a pool table, there is something wrong with the people working in that department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various other cases of government waste and mismanagement that I could highlight, but it only needs a few examples to suggest that this government could be much more careful in the way that it oversees the spending of public moneys. I think of all of those small business people and all of those self-employed people trying to get by under the burden of this government.

The OECD statistics show that Australia has a relatively small public sector by both expenditure and employment measures. Our Public Service must already account for what it does and what it spends. Working with public sector unions, a Labor government has improved efficiency and undertaken workplace reforms which deliver better service at a lower cost&mdash;something that the opposition would not have been in a position to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is other evidence of increased efficiency in Labor administration. The 1984 financial management improvement program linked agency resources and programs to corporate goals and established performance standards&mdash;all pro-active, not reactive. The 1984 Public Service Reform Act ensured merit based promotion and equal opportunity in employment, while giving greater flexibility and responsibility to agencies for managing their resources. Award restructuring abolished old, inefficient workplace practices and demarcations through measures such as integrated job structures and amalgamation of employment groups. These were all measures designed to save millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiskilling produced massive efficiencies through training and better job opportunities. An ongoing focus on workplace reform continues to deliver efficient improvements. The Economic Planning Advisory Council in paper 44 shows that productivity growth within the public sector in the late 1980s was actually higher than in the private sector at three per cent a year&mdash;and continues to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After looking at that situation, we turn to some of the criticisms that might have been made. I have in front of me a press release by Senator Campbell. He states that, under the public interest work program, the Australian taxpayer is currently funding three staff for a combined salary of $145,000 who are assessing a floating pontoon for the South Australian Maritime Museum in Port Adelaide. When we look at the real facts, we find that the figure of $145,000 is false; it is intended to be critical of someone in a dishonest way. The real figure is the actual cost of $1,247 which is assistance to the South Australian Maritime Museum to evaluate a reinforced concrete pontoon, public access and platform for a tugboat display for museum exhibits. This, of course, is using people who will be displaced from DAS in a way that does not create very hurtful job losses. We have used them and gradually we will work through them and they will be found other places or taken out of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now look at another situation where Senator Campbell claims that two senior public servants who each earn $47,840 a year&mdash;and that is fair enough&mdash;are based on Norfolk Island doing heritage work. The real facts are that the costs to date are $12,937, or $13,000 in round figures, and it is assistance to the Kingston and Arthur Vale historic area management board on the island.

Standing order 191 says quite clearly that a Senator `shall not introduce any new matter', meaning any new topic. Material which explains the speech is quite in order in 191 provided debatable matter is not introduced. Clearly, a graph which sets out certain facts which clarify a point already made by Senator Campbell is not a new matter and not a debatable matter. Therefore, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would respectfully suggest to you that Senator Sherry is quite clearly off the point.

Indeed, there was some clarification as to the information regarding the $145,000 salaries for the floating pontoon and I think $90,000 in salaries for the Norfolk Island heritage work. However, that was clarified by officers of the department at estimates last week and they understood entirely why the information they provided me may have been misunderstood.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that there are several important provisions and recommendations in report No. 42 of the Auditor-General which should be brought to the attention of the Senate. The four aspects in particular that I would like to comment on are inequity in provision, the role of the private sector, the planning as detailed in this report and also some matters of fraud which have been brought to the attention of the Senate by this Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an extremely rapid growth in recent years in fee relief and child-care assistance expenditure accompanied by very strong community support for the provision of child care. I would note that the Auditor-General recognises that the present provision of places for non-work care is inequitable. The child-care places for non-work related purposes are available only in areas where there is insufficient demand to fill places for work related care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office recommended that the department develop options for care for children and families and support for families at home that are more affordable to parents and do not require large government subsidies, such as limits on the amount of care in long day care and family day care, rostered play groups and subsidised play leaders to manage play groups that provide respite care on a rostered basis. There is a department need to ensure that services follow guidelines on priority of access to allocate available places to children of families with greatest economic or social need. I remain unconvinced by the department's statements that this is actually being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to develop a policy on child-care assistance for part-time care in both long day care and family day care programs that recognise additional costs. Parents, particularly women at home, often put a low monetary value on a break for themselves in comparison with meeting other household needs, and the government is reasonably guilty of putting a low value on women who choose to stay at home with their children, as exemplified by the inequitable payments to different groups of women. I refer to the $61.20 maximum child-care rebate for a family with two children which chooses to place those children in child care as compared with the $30 per week provided to stay at home parents through the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate. That is something that the coalition would like to see addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for any government to give more equitable treatment in the provision of money in assistance to families as far as looking after very young children is concerned. Even though provided in the recent budget, the parenting allowance provides for a small band of low income earners and it could hardly be called a comprehensive response to this problem by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the role of the private sector, I note the auditor's concerns about the planning of the program and I particularly endorse the recommendation that the department develop a strategy for private child-care services to influence growth away from areas already well supplied with work related care. The department says that it recognises this recommendation and supports the development of strategies to encourage the private sector to maximise its contribution. I certainly hope that it is going to move down this path. I would like to see the government continue along this line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to see greater cooperation between private and community-based services, such as the mutual sharing of their expertise. In the mushrooming of services in this area there has been a proliferation in both private provision and community-based provision and there should be a greater sharing of resources between the two groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would also like to support the concept of self-help play groups in modelling good play and parenting skills and assisting parents with social problems that become apparent. The provision of help for play groups is a relatively low cost option which, at the same time, encourages parental cooperation and self-help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a much greater need for more accurate planning, which is essential to assess priorities. Day care centres and child-care centres have now been provided&mdash;slowly to start with and more quickly in recent years&mdash;in very many areas of most metropolitan and provincial cities. Over a 20-year period there is probably a need to assess the placement of existing centres, as to whether they have fulfilled their purpose, and the provision of future centres, as to where they are going to be located. The department should look carefully at planning priorities for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular groups of the community, such as Aboriginal children and non-English speaking background children, the program services have the potential to provide an important focus for women and children in areas that are often dominated by men's issues and they need to provide a wide range of programs. But the lack of integrated planning in both the Aboriginal and non-English speaking background areas has probably restricted the programs that have been delivered in many locations. Joint planning with other complementary service providers is a matter of importance and services funded by the program, if they are to achieve their potential, should be cost effective and avoid any harmful side effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I would like to deal with in the brief time allotted to me is that of fraud. The audit office recommended that the department strengthen the monitoring and enforcing of rules for child-care assistance. The department needs to enhance its compliance program of service assessment to guard against fraud and error in the payment of child-care assistance. Recently the Senate was told of a major concern that, although child care is paid for on the basis of hours booked, the compliance program estimated that up to 30 per cent of paid care in average private long day care centres is not actually provided. So centre operators are claiming and being paid for that care but in actual fact the hours are not provided. It is then available for the centre operators to top up those vacant hours with other fee paying clients and their children. That level of fraud is to be guarded against. The department needs also to keep under review its involvement in the building of community based centres to ensure the most cost effective use of public funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examples of savings in the area of child care are, first, to encourage private investment in areas identified as having high need for long day care centres; and, secondly, to continue to tighten the current child-care assistance rules and to improve and regularise the accountability and compliance auditing of child-care assistance. The government has claimed that it is starting to do so and I would hope that this is being effective. The overriding need and requirement in this area is to ensure that all services remain affordable to parents and to government. </PARA>

I use this as an example of things being very wrong in the government's handling of child care, which is confirmed by the Auditor-General's report. There are many important issues raised by this report.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out major shortcomings and gross inefficiencies in the operations of the department, and reports of promises of more expenditure by the department on child care and child growth strategies are confused and inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly $2 billion has been spent by the department over the last seven years. The report points out that of the 1988 quota of 30,000 extra places only 27,000 have been created. Worse still, four years after the 1990 election promise to create an extra 50,000 places, only 5,000 places have been created. The money is there but the places are not. The number of new places has only now reached the level promised in 1988. The report identifies totally ineffective Commonwealth-state relations. The department has not been able to come up with satisfactory arrangements for the states. The inability to reach agreement has put the whole 50,000 new places strategy down the drain. It is a damning indictment of the Commonwealth department in its coordinating role and a greater loss to the community's child-care needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report identifies that private for-profit LDC centres accounted for most of the recent growth. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates are made of the likely private sector growth which is factored into the targets for meeting work-related demands by the year 2001 . . . at present there are no methods to influence growth in areas which are already well supplied. In most areas, planning data is not made available to private services, even on a user-pays basis, to enable them to locate their services in areas with a high level of assessed needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The potential of the private sector contribution is being ignored and planning projections are not reaching the private sector providers of child care in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with planning. The report wants a higher rate of payment for under three-year-olds. Despite the crying need for special planning and consideration for the increasing demand for child care for under three-year-olds, this area has not been addressed in the government's policy. The private sector has repeatedly suggested increasing the number of places for under three-year-olds. To date, the department has not picked this up which is clearly confirmed by this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report highlights many areas of confusion in the department. It concerns me greatly. It has involved taxpayers' expenditure of almost $1 billion a year, and it is all about children, the nation's most precious resource. This report shows the government department to be lacking in planning strategies. The report should be studied closely by the department so that Australian families can get good value for their child-care tax dollar. </PARA>

The amendments which we expect to be developed over the next few weeks should result in appropriate legislation which will serve to protect the interest of overseas students, while minimising the administrative and cost burdens to private providers in establishing tuition assurance schemes. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of Senator Zakharov. As she pointed out, it has indeed been a particularly worthwhile exercise that is at last reaching fruition after several years of operation. It is very important that the committee and this parliament go through this process because we are dealing with one of the most important and rapidly growing export industries in this country. Since we first considered the legislation, the size of the educational export market has grown from 800 million a year to almost 1,500 million. With this almost exponential growth it is very important that the legislative framework that is put in to support such an industry is put in correctly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I entered this parliament in 1991 I was somewhat alarmed to find the government&mdash;at that stage alarmed by its experience with Chinese students after the Tiananmen massacres&mdash;bringing in an inappropriate piece of legislation which was draconian in nature. The minister finally backed down and agreed to almost 30 coalition amendments. So we had a piece of legislation which was better than what was proposed, but it was not perfect at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the industry has developed and matured and there have been a number of regulations and changes to tighten up provisions of the act. What we have just been considering is perhaps the final major tightening of the act. Here again, as in 1991, the government really decided to go too far and, with the initial tuition assurance scheme, proposed another draconian piece of legislation which would have required all providers to belong to one tuition assurance scheme&mdash;to take out insurance and to therefore add to the costs of an industry that is highly price competitive internationally. This would have not only put an onerous administrative burden on them but also put up their costs to the point where, in some markets, they may not have been competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard&mdash;and Senator Bell and the Australian Democrats have heard&mdash;quite a lot from the industry, both in correspondence to us and more recently in the submissions before the hearing, on what its concerns were. It was very disturbing therefore that DEET over this period was not listening. It was not until last Friday, when we drew all the parties together, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training was under the Damocles sword of a disallowance motion moved by Senator Bell, that it really came to the negotiating table properly. It listened to what the industry was suggesting and came up with a much more sensible tuition assurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved away from having one draconian scheme across Australia that everyone joins to a position that is much more decentralised and deregulated. The key element of the whole scheme is that the providers, through their national associations, can set up a tuition assurance arrangement and make sure that any students disadvantaged by the collapse of a college can be actually placed. That is probably the most important measure of the lot to come out of recent negotiations. They cannot join an association until they agree to take part in a voluntary student placement scheme. I believe that answers most of the government's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this proposal there is also the possibility for providers of unique courses, such as theology&mdash;which over 100 years have an excellent track record in this field&mdash;to be exempt. There is provision for new players to come into the industry to provide, by bank guarantee or insurance, the guarantee for tuition assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as this morning I had a telephone call from one of the major industry players saying they are quite pleased with the negotiations to date; but are concerned about what might happen from this point on over the winter break. They still do not totally trust DEET. I can understand that, given the history of the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it was very heartening for the committee to receive today, through the mechanism of a letter from the minister, Simon Crean, an assurance on how this process will develop from this point. I seek leave to table the letter from the minister, Simon Crean, and the record of the DEET/ industry meeting. I did check this with Senator Sherry 10 minutes ago. He was the predecessor in the chamber of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is sitting opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fine. The industry still has some worries about the final form of the tuition assurance scheme and is waiting to see that final form. I believe that Senator Bell will be moving that the timing of his disallowance motion be extended so that we can come back and look at this matter in August. By that time the industry will have had time to consult with DEET and DEET will have had time to make the necessary adjustment to the legislation and the regulations, particularly concerning the tuition assurance scheme. Things will then be in place for this industry to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say that this process, although long and drawn out, has really shown the power of this Senate to consider and alter inappropriate legislation. There are mechanisms in the Senate which will bring the government back to consider a matter, to have the government not only listen to members of the Senate but also listen to what the industry is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Senator Bell for moving the disallowance motion that put this in place and to Senator Hill, who moved that this matter be considered by the Senate standing committee which I think did an excellent job in the last few days in putting together a form of tuition assurance most appropriate for this industry. Under this new form of legislation this industry, which has already contributed so much to Australia, will thrive and prosper and will become one of our great export earners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report in front of us is evidence, as Senator Tierney said, of this chamber's capacity to initiate and to then facilitate the resolution of a matter which has been seen to be difficult to resolve for many years. In fact, it was one of the first issues with which I became involved in this place when I arrived. It concerns an industry which has the capacity to be a leading export earner for Australia, if it is not already recognised as such.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes very little time for the dollars and for the value of this industry to mount up when we consider that each student who comes from overseas to study in Australia for a semester unit is paying on average $5,000 to study for that semester. Added to that is the consumption of goods and services that the resident student would then be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney mentioned that over a short time the value to Australia of this industry&mdash;effectively it is an export industry; even though it takes place in Australia, the money is received from overseas, and that makes it equivalent to an export industry&mdash;has risen from some $800 million to $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that during that same time frame that Senator Tierney referred to, the sector of that industry with which this report is mainly concerned&mdash;in other words, the private providers of education services for overseas students&mdash;had declined in value from $200 million to $120 million. There were several reasons for this decline. I will not go into them piece by piece because that was done in the committee, which was able to determine the reasons for the decline and seek a solution to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A characteristic of the conditions that applied to those providers at the time is that it was a confusion: the rules, the regulations, the factors that applied to this sector of the industry were indeterminate and in fact very difficult for an enterprise to come to grips with. It is amazing to me that so many of the enterprises attempting to take part in this market have actually survived to this day. We see a group of very strong enterprises having survived in an area where, in many cases, the administrators, those administering regulations, were themselves confused about which regulations applied to whom, when, and under what circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than having a firm and relevant framework, this industry was operating very much in a whirlpool. Through the work of this committee, the department and the providers of education services themselves, we now have the opportunity to establish such a framework. This committee has persisted in insisting that the industry of private providers be organised and be able to represent itself in a unified way, a characteristic which was not necessarily present in the beginning phases of the industry. It can now do that to such an extent that its self-regulation can be effective, worth while and lead to stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has recognised this. That can be seen in the letter from the minister which Senator Tierney tabled. I think it is that recognition of the persistence of the committee which has brought us to a point which I am most optimistic about. I am optimistic that the industry has the capacity to regulate itself in a way which will satisfy the minister that those who are members of professional associations or the associations of the industry have the capacity to arrive at a suitable tuition assurance scheme and also to conduct the industry with such a degree of supervision that practices which are not beneficial to the students are eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As just foreshadowed by Senator Tierney, I intend to delay the consideration of my disallowance motion, a motion which in some ways has forced this matter to a head. It would be entirely unproductive if it were considered at the intended moment. Because of the work of the committee, the department needs the opportunity to properly conclude its negotiations with the industry itself. I am optimistic that that opportunity will be taken, but we will see when we resume our sitting in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this moment we should recognise the patience and considerable contribution that was made by the chair in this matter. It has not been at all easy to see an end to this matter, and it has required the repetition of many aspects of work. Senator Zakharov should be congratulated for her patience in this matter. It has brought us to a position where we have a report which is supported by all the parties involved. Honourable senators would know that achieving that in any committee is not an easy matter for this Senate, but it has been done on this occasion. The report's value as a comprehensive and completely supported report is great because that has contributed considerably to the resolve of each party. The industry, the department and perhaps even the minister could not dispute the fact that Senator Zakharov's being able to facilitate a unified report means that the resolve of those involved has been somewhat stronger than it might have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise the contribution that has been made by the secretariat, particularly Mr Brenton Holmes, who has had the imaginative capacity to determine the right word to fit the somewhat vague nuances that have often been necessary to explain just what was going on. In fact, all members of the secretariat have been helpful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate all other members of the committee. Senator Tierney has put a lot of work into this. Other members of the committee have worked hard to ensure that we reached this point. I am optimistic about the future. I have said that six times, but I am optimistic. I just hope that the next time we hear of this business there is a complete resolution of the problems we have had over many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I continue my remarks on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill I might address those of Senator Spindler, who mentioned that there being perhaps some avenue of appeal from the corporations and securities panel was a factor which the Australian Democrats took on board in not opposing the bill. My comment in relation to that is that it is important to get things right in the first instance and that we should not simply rely on an avenue of appeal as a sort of bandaid action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are looking at, as I said earlier, is a complex area of the law dealing with the takeover of companies. This panel is charged with overseeing the corporate behaviour in that regard. As such, it should have some degree of formality about it and, more particularly, should observe the rules of natural justice. The Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills expressed a reservation that the proposed amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties in taking away the right to a public hearing of an adversarial nature with legal representation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is in only that sort of environment that one can sometimes get to the bottom of the facts. I am not saying that that would be needed in every case. What I am saying is that this is a complex area of the law and one could well expect there to be differing versions of what took place or what might take place and how it might affect shareholders or the companies concerned. In that regard it might assist the panel to have present not only a solicitor representing the parties concerned but also a stockbroker or an accountant, as I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said earlier was that there were some very good things about this bill. This bill deals with a number of non-related areas which did need looking at. In this particular instance the government has adopted a simple solution to overcome a problem which is indeed notoriously complex. I think the government could well be making a rod for its back if it does not get this piece of legislation right. As Senator Vanstone said earlier, excluding lawyers and making things more simple might not necessarily give us the remedy that we are after. This is one particular area I think the government should approach with utmost caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with those comments that I endorse the coalition's stance in opposing this bill. I believe that this matter will revisit the government at later date and that approaching in a rather trite manner what could well be a very complex matter is fraught with danger. I think this area of the law will be back again before us in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill is the first part of a simplification program that needs immediate attention. I wish to take some time tonight to draw to the Senate's attention an omission from these amendments that many believe should have been included in this category. I refer to what is referred to as the doctrine of joint and several liability. This is an ongoing problem that is particularly important to professional people, including accountants and auditors, who have to live with the outdated doctrine of joint and several liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the Attorney-General has recently initiated an inquiry to assess whether there exists a prima facie case for reform of the law as it affects professionals. Depending on the outcome of stage one of that inquiry, stage two will go on to propose the nature and scope of changes to the present law. I have no doubt that changes to the law will be seen as necessary and in the public interest, and hopefully the reforms will not be long delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who are not familiar with the concept of joint and several liability, I would point out that it is the process whereby a plaintiff may recover the entire amount of a judgment from one or more defendants. A particular defendant can be called upon to pay the entire amount of a plaintiff's claim even if that defendant's share of fault is minor compared to that of other wrongdoers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, if one of the defendant's appears unable to meet his or her share, the plaintiffs will aim their action towards the so-called "deep-pocket defendants", in many cases the professionals who have taken the responsible course and taken out professional indemnity insurance cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that professional indemnity insurance is being asked to cover the potential negligence not only of auditors but of other unrelated parties as well. Of course, this leads to dramatic increases in the cost of professional indemnity insurance, especially for the largest firms where professional indemnity insurance premiums now exceed $60,000 per annum per partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this situation cannot be allowed to continue in this way. It is of particular concern to those professionals in law and accounting that this matter continues unresolved while bills such as that which is now before the Senate are introduced into parliament, further complicating the already complex corporations laws of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the present doctrine of joint and several liability continues as it is, the ability of professionals to provide an appropriate level of professional indemnity cover is put further at risk with every day that passes. Although the exposure of the accounting profession to rising liability claims is partly a result of the corporate collapses of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the underlying trend towards rising liability claims is mirrored in other professions such as medicine, law, engineering and architecture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it appears that without significant reform, there is no reason to believe that the professional indemnity insurance market will improve in the future. It already appears that the `Big Six' accountancy firms may in future find commercial insurance entirely unprocurable, and the rest of the accountancy profession will find the cover increasingly expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, of course, these costs are passed on to clients and include, at some time or other, most Australians. Even for a small client, any system of liability that effectively decreases the incentive of professionals to maintain professional indemnity insurance by making them targets for litigation is ultimately not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem with joint and several liability as it currently exists is the growing tendency to ignore the fact that investors and shareholders are, and must be, risk-takers. Profits are the reward for that risk. Too often there is an expectation that losses, where these occur, must somehow be recouped from others. It is when this view is pursued to its conclusion that auditors become the underwriters of failed businesses. This is not to diminish the right of plaintiffs to pursue genuine neglect or fraud cases, but an apportionment of the fault should be reflected in the degree of the burden meted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there is a growing body of authoritative thought and action worldwide directed at the principle that professionals should not pay for others' mistakes merely because they are the only ones left standing after a financial collapse. Simple fairness and commonsense demand such an approach. It is pleasing to see that several states in the United States have completely abolished the doctrine of joint and several liability and that the recent South Australian Development Act 1993 has moved towards replacing it with proportional liability. Similar legislation has been prepared in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has certainly arrived for a reform of the present rules on joint liability. As we add yet another set of laws to those presently surrounding the accounting and legal professions, I urge the Attorney-General to act without delay to reform the law on joint and several liability and return fairness and justice to this area of our country's laws. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the third amendment, the Australian Democrats regard the proceedings before the panel as being designed to hear contributions from people with practical experience in the field; its task is essentially a fact finding one.

With the present procedure, if the Senate is unhappy with certain regulations it can disallow them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of matters that would go before this panel are far more complex than the simple questions I have just put by way of example, yet, as Senator Spindler puts it, it is just a matter of people being asked to put their case about what happened. Before I came here, I did a number of crash-bangs as a junior barrister and I can say that even months after an accident people will argue about what happened. But the sort of detail involved in those sorts of cases is kids' stuff compared with the detail people are trying to sort out in these hearings&mdash;the consequences are more important, the facts are more complicated, and much more detailed presentation is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since normal citizens cannot handle the simpler sorts of matters that I have referred to, it is a bit rich for Senator Spindler to suggest that people should be able to go before this panel without an agent to speak on their behalf or without a specialist advocate to put their views in the best way possible. That does not mean that people could lie or tell another story; it simply means that they will have someone to put their case in its best light.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are probably two or three points that need to be responded to, but given the previous debate on this matter I am not sure that I need go through them at length. Senator Spindler is right: if these amendments fail, the regulations can still be disallowed by the Senate. It is obvious that in such circumstances the government would have to negotiate with the other parties to ensure that a set of regulations reasonable to them were able to get through to this place. That is the way in which the Senate normally operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the natural justice aspect. Under amended subsection 195(3) we now have a clear statement of the government's intention that the panel's obligation is to accord to parties natural justice, and that that obligation will be met where the procedural requirements set out in division 3 of part 10 of the ASC act and in the regulations are followed in the course of an inquiry. Basically, the government is proposing a system clarifying, for both the tribunal and the parties appearing before the tribunal, a step-by-step procedure which the panel is to adopt in order to ensure that all parties receive a fair hearing. In that context, and in the context of the regulations, I am advised that draft regulations have already been made available to the opposition for its consideration and, if they have not been made available to the Democrats, we can ensure that that takes place as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point before us concerned representation before the panel. The government's motivation here is pretty clearly understood and has long been well known. Under the existing provisions governing procedures the panel cannot work effectively; the Titan Hills case demonstrated that. There have been problems with the amount of time taken up in legal argument before the panel by legal advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's intention and the effect of the procedures that are now being proposed is not to prevent parties from having proper legal advice; that is totally possible and probably preferred. The rationale for the changes is that the panel will have discretion and flexibility to make an assessment of who can appear before it. It will not be precluded from allowing an adviser to get up and address it on a particular matter at its discretion. That sort of flexibility is desired. As the debate has already canvassed, in circumstances where injustice takes place, there is of course judicial review under the ADJR. I think the package of provisions in this case present for the parliament a more balanced approach, and one that recognises natural justice but also the need for flexibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to canvass all of the matters that have gone before. I just want to make a couple of very brief points and ask a couple of simple questions. My brief points relate to schedule 4 and proposed subsection 191(2). This proposed subsection obviously envisages that the panel will have the power of summonsing a person&mdash;a coercive power to compel people to attend. As Senator Vanstone has just indicated, they do not then have as of right representation by a lawyer to put points to the panel. Proposed subsection 194(4) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who appears at an inquiry is entitled to have another person present to assist the person, but a person who so assists is not entitled to address the Panel.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we have proposed subsection 199(1). Quite serious penalties are involved, and yet the individual does not have the right to legal representation. Whilst the minister has indicated that the panel will have the say on whether that takes place, I wonder how the minister feels about this. Firstly, persons are required to attend on summons; that is a coercive element. Secondly, there are quite serious penalties involved. If that is the case, what is the logic behind denying a person the right to legal representation in those cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, what is the constitutional basis for enforcing the findings of a non-court as if they were court orders? I think the committee is really entitled to have a look at that because, if we go along that track, we really are looking at this question of the division of powers between the judiciary, the executive and the parliament. I ask the minister to give, chapter and verse, the constitutional basis for enforcing findings of a non-court as if they were court orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mechanism under the legislation is that, for an order to be enforceable, the panel would have to go to the Federal Court for an enforceability order. That protection is already in the machinery of the legislation. Under the constitution, Senator Harradine is right, there is separation of powers. The separation is tackled within this legislation by empowering access to the Federal Court and for the Federal Court to make orders that are then enforceable. That is the answer to the second part of Senator Harradine's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part goes very much to the point I was making earlier. There have been enormous problems under existing provisions governing the operation of the panel and its procedures. The experience has been that, because of the continual raising of technical legal matters, the panel has been very clearly frustrated in its operation. The experience, for instance, in the Titan Hills case was that the amount of time taken up in legal argument before the panel by legal advisers was endless, the matter was pursued to other courts as well and, at the end of the day, we had a very frustrating process which did not in any way accommodate not just the justice interests but also the interests of the parties involved in the process&mdash;at least, the working of the marketplace in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government's position has been to allow for some flexibility to be imparted into the machinery of operation here to allow for people to be represented but subject to the discretion of the panel. That is to be coupled with the fact that any enforceable order has to come from the Federal Court, that this machinery is also subject to review under the ADJR, which gives further protection, and also to the natural justice provisions that we discussed earlier in the context of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem really is that, unless one allows some sort of flexibility like that proposed here, one will finish up with the stunted processes we had in the Titan Hills case, which would do no-one any good at all. So Senator Harradine should keep in mind not just these provisions but also the fact that the provisions are part of a general framework of operation which does allow for external judicial review but also has within it obligations of natural justice and, at the end of the day, the ultimate protection in that any enforcement has to come from the Federal Court. </PARA>

I understand what the minister is saying about the panel being able to allow for legal representation. But, in the end, unless the appeal under ADJR in the Federal Court is successful on the grounds the minister mentioned, then the merits of the case will have been determined by the panel without the individual having as of right his or her entitlement to legal representation.

Quite frankly, I am inclined, very much, to vote for the proposal put forward by Senator Vanstone; I think it is a reasonable one. It is a question of let us see the regulations and let us have a positive vote of both houses of parliament on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In leading this debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 for the opposition, let me say at the outset that we in the opposition recognise the importance for industry and business of the amendments contained within this legislation, particularly the amendments relating to unfair dismissal provisions which have wrought havoc in business across the nation and have threatened small business with the prospect of potential bankruptcy. That is why we are pleased to see this bill make an appearance this week after being taken off the  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> last week.

<PARA>In the last few months we have had an enormous fanfare from the government about its Industrial Relations Reform Act, the legislation that was passed through this chamber at the end of last year. The government has spent a great deal&mdash;$540,491 to be precise&mdash;in advertising the act nationally. That is more than half a million dollars of taxpayers' money to promote a flawed, prejudicial, nonsensical and unworkable act which has so many problems associated with it that the government continually comes back to tinker around the edges without tackling the real and central problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem is that this out of touch, tired government is still beholden to its union masters who refuse to acknowledge the degree to which a rigid, complicated, legalistic and totally inflexible labour market cripples industry and prevents industry from employing those who have been painfully sidelined during the recession `we had to have'. In a period of growth when it could be reasonably expected that many of the unemployed would become unemployed, we found that the centrepiece of the government's Working Nation white paper, the training wage, the advent of which we in the opposition have been advocating for some time in its present form, was seriously threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we welcome the government's initiative in its introduction of a training wage and the abolition of the traineeship scheme, and, indeed, this initiative for a transitory phase from payment by age to payment by competency, we condemn the government for subjecting employers to the uncertainty created by its unfair dismissal provisions. We condemn it for prolonging that uncertainty and we condemn it for the effect such a delay has had on the unemployed, who have had to wear the reticence of business to take on new employees because of that very uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage was nearly jeopardised because the government, in its arrogance, failed to consult with industry and employer group representatives, the representatives of the companies to whom the nation looks to supply jobs for young unemployed people. It may yet be jeopardised despite recent assurances from all concerned that Mr Crean `has taken care of it' because the government has been misguided by the training bureaucracy mentality of its union mates in forcing the training wage through its too rigid award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the shadow of the failed traineeship scheme, which achieved less than 20,000 places for young people, nowhere near its touted 75,000 places, this training wage system may also be doomed to failure because it places the interests of unions above the interests of the unemployed and ignores the demands of Australians that the youth of this country be given a chance. Mr Crean was forced to meet twice with employer groups in Melbourne last week to allay their fears about the proposed training wage announced in May as part of the white paper for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some employer groups complained that the wage, particularly the youth wage component, would force businesses to pay higher wages than currently exist under the award system. The government would be well advised to take heed of what the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have had to say. It would be well advised, in this instance, to take heed of what the MTIA has had to say&mdash;loud warnings that the government's training wage levels are not appropriate across all industries, that the training wage is too high and, to quote the Chief Executive of the MTIA, Mr Bert Evans, `alarmingly higher than existing awards for metal industry workers aged 20 and under'. Consequently, many businesses may still be deterred from hiring young unemployed people, especially long-term unemployed. Labor's rigid award system has priced Australia's adolescent youth out of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the union's response to this warning? The ACTU threatened to withdraw support for the training wage and stated that it would retaliate with the pursuit of higher wages if the training wage rates were reopened for negotiation. Largely because of the unions' tiresome and erroneous arguments for a rigid labour market and the government's maintenance of the union stance, high long-term unemployment and youth unemployment have persisted. While a rigid labour market exists, unacceptable employment levels will continue. While these amendments are a step in the right direction, and we in the opposition will not oppose them, the procedures for determining Labor's competency standards add to the inflexibility of the youth labour market and lock out many of those whom they are intended to assist. The procedures adopted must be realistic and practical and include experience as a competency factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call for a flexible and efficient labour market was heard very recently at the International Labour Organisation annual conference held this month. First World labour policies have been criticised for being too prescriptive and not conducive to the economies of the Third World. I suggest that this government's labour policies are too prescriptive and not conducive to the Australian economy. The nations which have rejected the ILO Labor policies are precisely the nations with fast growing economies and with which Australia competes in our region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Australia's position is not looking too rosy, given the prediction of ANZ economists that Australia's job growth will level out to a rate between 1.5 and two per cent for the rest of the year. The Labor government's estimate of five per cent growth by the year 2000 is looking highly questionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has stated quite clearly that the rigidity of labour markets is a major contributing factor to high unemployment. This government's Industrial Relations Reform Act, which was raced through without consultation by the government with anyone, has entrenched that rigidity and has effectively prevented employers from taking on new staff. It is pleasing to see that the minister is finally showing some sense in amending the act's onerous unfair dismissal provisions, but one cannot overlook the fact that this occurs a mere two months after their introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur with my colleagues in the other place, particularly with shadow minister John Howard, in their view that these amendments make a ludicrous situation slightly better. We applaud the government for its commitment to review these provisions after another 12 month period, but condemn it for not getting it right in the first place. However, one only needs to look at the ACTU's response to these amendments to be highly suspicious of such a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the government will see fit to listen to industry and employers and realise just how crippling to industry the unfair dismissal provisions are and how they deter business, especially small businesses which face the prospect of being bankrupted by a claim, from employing new staff. Perhaps it will be only the massive failure of this government to generate jobs, to ease the unemployment in this country, which will give it the courage to say no to its union bosses. Perhaps then it will make a genuine attempt to achieve a reduction in unemployment instead of merely fudging the figures by moving people from the unemployment statistics and hiding the numbers in mature age and training categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the unemployed are under 17, over 17 and training, any age and disabled, or over 60 and mature, they are still looking for jobs which do not exist. While industry is shackled with inflexible, legalistic, complex and expensive labour and taxation rules and regulations, and paperwork required for on cost systems&mdash;such as the prescribed payment scheme and superannuation&mdash;which stifle innovation and prevent small business from operating efficiently, industry will continue to be deterred from hiring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging to learn that the Australian Taxation Office is proposing to simplify the fringe benefits tax regime. The move to simplify record keeping rules&mdash;for example, log books required to calculate the value of motor vehicle fringe benefits&mdash;must be welcome news for business. There are obvious productivity gains to be made by business in the relieving of tedious administrative time taken to comply with this aspect of FBT requirements. However, for each step forward there are two backwards. Even attempts by industry to conform with the government's new look enterprise agreements are thwarted by unwarranted and unwelcome union intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago employees of the Toys `R' Us firm negotiated an agreement with their employer for a $40 per week increase above the state award in exchange for greater flexibility in working hours and the elimination of the 17 1/2 per cent annual leave loading. The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union had access to these negotiations and presented a case to the employees which the employees themselves rejected. The union then sought and obtained federal award coverage for these employees totally disregarding their interests and wishes. So much for the government's move to enterprise agreement negotiations. It is simply a facade, and does not exist in reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Australian Services Union sought and obtained a federal interim award covering major retailers including K-Mart, Myer, Safeway, Brashs, Georges and Target, rendering ineffective individual employment contracts made between retailers and clerical workers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 June a small Melbourne company, Able Demolitions and Excavations, was forced to convert a workplace agreement into a certified agreement with the CFMEU after being hit with work bans. The Victorian Trades Hall Council industrial officer, Brian Boyd, was quoted as saying to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be determined as hell to make sure Able or anyone else does not break out of the process and try to bypass the unions.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also the example of the attempt by Optus to pursue an enterprise flexibility agreement. Only 100 Optus staff have joined the Communication Workers Union and yet we find the CWU attempting to enforce a union shop. It has applied to the Industrial Relations Commission to have a bans clause inserted into the agreement to give the union unrestricted access to Optus workplaces. This is yet another example of unwarranted, unnecessary and unwanted union interference in enterprise agreements between an employer and its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government ought to realise that something is drastically wrong with the industrial relations path it is on when all states have joined in a case against the Commonwealth to block state employees moving to federal awards. Such across-the-board action should alert the government that something really is amiss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current industrial relations legislation is ineffective; it does not allow for genuine enterprise bargaining and gives excessive power to the unions. The Labor government preaches one thing and its union bosses practise quite another. The Industrial Relations Reform Act is iniquitous and biased in favour of the unions. Unfair dismissal provisions have opened the door to a flood of claims being lodged&mdash;some 600 in two months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its recently published document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The federal Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">: an employer review</EMPHASIS> has concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contents of the Act make it quite clear that it was not the result of a process of reviewing the needs of industry. It was the result of an extensive dialogue with the union movement in which the needs of trade unions and employees were reviewed. In fact the only way to genuinely assist employees is to assist industry to become more competitive and profitable, and therefore able to provide more job security and employment. This Act does not assist the private sector and therefore will not benefit employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many important issues were not addressed. For example no real attempt was made to enter into discussions with State Governments, employers and unions, to develop by consensus a simple and fair national enterprise agreement procedure through joint federal/State legislation. Instead, State Governments were simply overridden by use of the external affairs power&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I should say the abuse of the external affairs power&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">precisely the reverse of the sort of cooperative federalism that is required. No attempt was made to promote greater decentralisation in trade union structures.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a damning indictment of this legislation by the employers' organisation. It clearly indicates that there is no incentive in the legislation to move to a more flexible enterprise based industrial relations system and, therefore, no incentive for industry to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore also no wonder that on 30 May 1994 the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry lodged a complaint with the International Labour Organisation Committee on Freedom of Association against the federal Industrial Relations Act. In that submission and complaint, the ACCI will argue that the legislation does not allow employers to bargain freely with their employees without being impeded by compulsory arbitration and the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present industrial relations system is not compatible with enterprise focused industrial relations. The complaint of the ACCI focuses on those elements of the system which impede an emphasis on workplace agreements. These include the general system of compulsory conciliation and arbitration, entrenchment of the award system, the procedures for approval of non-union agreements, the limitations on non-union agreements, the overriding of awards and agreements made in state jurisdictions and the complexity of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the most far-reaching ILO complaint ever lodged about the Australian system. The complaint claims that Australia has breached its obligations under ILO convention No. 87, the convention concerning freedom of association and the protection of the right to organise; and convention No. 98, the convention concerning the application of the principles for the right to organise and to bargain collectively. These conventions are integral to the ILO constitution and are applied by virtue of a country joining the ILO, whether it ratifies them formally or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has ratified these two conventions and the 1993 Industrial Relations Reform Act relied on them in introducing a right to strike in support of a claim for an enterprise agreement. The Australian government has been extremely selective in its approach to ILO conventions. The challenge for it now will be for it to take a more even-handed approach, which will require it to make changes to Australia's industrial relations system, which will be strongly opposed by the trade unions whose policies it has given priority in its legislative performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not opposing the second reading of this bill, our concern about the government's overall mishandling of industrial relations is reflected in the second reading amendment which I have already moved. We also have concerns with particular aspects of the bill, which I will address by proposing amendments in the committee stage. The first concern is the discrimination between award and non-award employees with regard to access to unfair dismissal provisions, which is detrimental to non-award employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the onus of proof provisions relating to termination of employment are particularly distressing for employers. Thirdly, the bill discriminates between award and non-award employees with regard to payment of compensation for unfair dismissal when there is no reinstatement, again to the detriment of non-award employees. These shortcomings clearly demonstrate that the government's industrial relations policies and legislation are framed to advantage its union mates rather than to create the circumstances for the betterment of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 has two main purposes. The first is to allow the continuation of youth wage rates until June 1997, notwithstanding the ban on age discrimination which was inserted in the Industrial Relations Act last year by the Australian Democrats. The second purpose is to greatly limit the unfair dismissal remedies inserted in the act last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of youth rates, the Democrats, I repeat, are totally committed to their abolition. We believe it is not appropriate in this day and age to reduce a person's pay merely because that person is young. Pay should be based on competence and the delivery and performance of the task in hand. It should be based on the ability to perform that task rather than on age. That is one reason we moved that age discrimination in awards and enterprise agreements be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no widespread and portable measure of confidence now in place which would allow the youth wage to be done away with overnight. We recognise that; and we recognise that the result is that most awards would be in conflict with the act as the Industrial Relations Commission goes through its first three-year review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats did not move the original age discrimination ban to bring the Industrial Relations Act to a grinding halt. So when the minister raised this problem with us some time ago, I indicated that we would accept a three-year delay in the abolition of youth wage rates while the first round of award reviews was conducted. Our acceptance of that carried the strict condition that when the three years were up, youth rates must be abolished unconditionally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation before us now meets our condition. The onus is now on the government, employers and unions to ensure that the Australian vocational certificate is well established by June 1997, when the second round of award reviews is to begin. Reluctantly we support these provisions, on the basis of practicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are much less happy with some of the changes to the unfair dismissal remedies. The effect of the proposed amendments we have before us today is to limit compensation claims to a maximum of six months salary and to exclude any non-award worker earning more than $60,000 per year from bringing a claim to the industrial relations court. Trainees and daily hire workers in the construction industry will be excluded by regulation, at a later date. Also, the onus of proof has been clarified&mdash;that is how it is described in the legislation&mdash;to make it clear that it is to be shared by employers and employees. The industrial relations court will be required to give priority to reinstatement and will be able to order that a reinstated employee be paid the income that he or she has lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unregistered employer associations will be allowed to represent employers in unfair dismissal cases before the court and commission, matching the rights currently enjoyed by unions. Our core objection to the main changes is that they are unfair. They are particularly unfair to low income earners. In a few cases, six months salary will not be enough to properly compensate an employee for the loss of livelihood; for example, where a dismissal has been particularly harsh and an employee has little chance of finding alternative employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that these amendments are a product of a fear campaign in which employer alarm has been whipped up, with only passing regard for the facts and reality. It should be remembered that the strongest objections to the unfair dismissal provisions voiced during last year's debate on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill came from a network of small businessmen who believed and continue to believe that employment should be based on a master-servant relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main employer groups at that time were far more concerned with non-union bargaining provisions than with changes to the secondary boycott laws. Unfortunately, the initial misinformation campaign has had its effect and the government has felt the need to step in and limit the damage. Our criticism is that the government has done so in haste and at the expense of the most vulnerable members of the work force. After I first raised our concerns about the changes, I received a letter dated 31 May this year from Chris Randell, the National Secretary of the Hospital Services Union of Australia. He said, about the HSUA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . represents in excess of 78,000 members nationally . . . The majority of HSUA's members are low paid women from non-english speaking backgrounds. The amendments proposed by the Minister for Industrial Relations if passed would directly discriminate against such employees . . . Eighty per cent of all . . . hospital blue-collar workers receive less than $22,000 per annum as a base salary without penalties. Current redundancy arrangements with the majority of the public sector employers . . . are such that it would be cheaper to summarily dismiss any worker with more than six to eight years service than to offer a redundancy payout. In the case of a worker with longer service, an employer could afford to unfairly sack a worker two or three times after orders for reinstatement were made and still save money as opposed to offering redundancy. It is reasonable to presume that with a nine-month delay built into the current reinstatement process a worker might tire of asking for their job back after two years of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I strongly support your view that capping payments discriminates against workers with long service and those likely to have difficulty finding work . . . The proposed changes are reactionary and have been introduced without any consultation whatsoever with organisations representing low paid workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality of the compensation cap. It is unjust to the most vulnerable members of the work force: the low paid, women and those with language difficulties. Employer groups have justified the cap on the basis of a few large payouts under the termination change in redundancy test case provisions and that they form the basis of the remedy in the act. Our response is that reinstatement was not an option in those cases and large payouts are a very rare exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real flaw in this position is the implied view that we cannot provide justice because it might cost too much in a few cases. The government has argued for a cap on the grounds that federal and state jurisdictions normally award compensation of two to five months' salary. The government has extended that to say that the average should be established in legislation. It points out that the minimum remedy will be provided to employees now lacking any remedy&mdash;for instance, those in Victoria and Tasmania&mdash;and that it is doing that without inviting gold-diggers on high salaries to flood the court with outrageous claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Democrats' view, the Industrial Relations Court should be allowed to demonstrate that the new provisions are not a goldmine. The IR Court itself should be allowed to demonstrate that. It undoubtedly would have done. The court should also be free to award more than six months' salary in those exceptional cases, few though they may be, where justice demands it. It is relevant to quote the words of Justice Gray in a judgment delivered on 6 June. In commenting on the minister's news release announcing the changes proposed in this legislation, Justice Gray noted that the court:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has had little opportunity to pronounce on the legislation as it exists. If evidence is needed of the possibility of a change of mind, then those circumstances provide it.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this parliament has shown no sign that it is about to change its mind, notwithstanding the impeccable logic of Justice Gray. The court has not been given an opportunity to put to rest unwarranted fears about this legislation, yet parliament seems determined to pre-empt it. A fundamental basis of my objection here is that we established a framework, we established an operational basis for the IR Court to operate within that framework and now we are pre-empting the opportunity of the IR Court to actually follow that framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are realistic enough to recognise that a cap will be put in place despite our objections. The opposition, as we have heard, is even more gung-ho about this than the government and wants the unfair dismissal remedies to be made even more unfair in our view. This is yet another case of the two major parties colluding to deny Australians their avenues to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving one amendment which goes some way to addressing our concerns. We will propose that the compensation cap be made $30,000 or six months' salary, whichever is the greater. If there has to be a cap, it should be a flat dollar amount so that those on lower award wages, as I have already mentioned and spelt out, will not be greatly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasoning behind our proposal is that, if employees want to claim more than the cap, they will have to take common law action and they will be able to. But the threshold cost of a common law case is high, and it does not vary with the income of the claimant. If an employee earning $20,000 wants to claim nine months' salary&mdash;in other words, $15,000&mdash;common law action is a waste of time because of the cost of initiating the procedures, while an action in the IR Court is impossible because of the cap. A cap which cannot fall below $30,000 provides better access to justice, we believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also have concerns about the exclusion of non-award employees earning more than $60,000 annually. The government claimed that that was needed to prevent high-fliers from clogging the court with claims at the expense of low income earners. On the surface of it, that seems to be a reasonable position to take, but we have yet to see a breakdown of cases that exist before the court which would substantiate that concern. We certainly share the view that the principal beneficiaries of new remedies should be the lowly paid, for whom common law action is the least affordable, but we have no evidence that this exclusion is needed, even though we have asked for that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is proposing that the $60,000 limit on the incomes of eligible non-award employees be applied to award workers as well. It seems to us that this is just an opportunistic attempt to further limit access to the new remedies by invoking pseudo-equity principles. There is obviously an inconsistency between the eligibility limits for award and non-award employees but the answer lies in expanding access for non-award workers, not limiting it for those who are covered by awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern for the Democrats is the exclusion of trainees from the remedies. The advice we have received is that proposed new training schemes will not work unless trainees are excluded. I suppose this is the case even though the regulations already exclude anyone serving a reasonable period of probation. It is an unfortunate fact that this probationary provision and the generous taxpayer funded subsidies are apparently not enough to encourage employers to take on trainees. I suggest that a big part of that problem is attitude and part of that attitude belongs to the government, which is yet to make up its mind about whether it is running a training program or an employment program. It calls it one thing and yet wants to include the employment provisions from another set of frameworks in what is essentially a training program. Again, being pragmatic, we recognise this is what needs to be done and, while being dissatisfied, we know it will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus of proof amendment is, in our opinion, more of a clarification than a change, although again it pre-empts the Industrial Relations Court. We do not object to that amendment. We do not believe it needs to be further weighted in favour of the employers, as the opposition proposes. The coalition's amendment suggests a lack of confidence in the court's ability to dispense justice. In the unlikely event that the court interprets those provisions to place an undue burden of proof on employers, we would consider reasonable changes. But we again recognise practically that that is unlikely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has proposed a second reading amendment which the Democrats will not be supporting. The final line calls on the government to abandon the Industrial Relations Reform Act. This seems to us to be a premature judgment. It also implies that the opposition's approach to industrial relations is preferable, a proposition with which the Democrats would have a great deal of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of abandoning the reform act is that we would revert to the IR Act as it stood before. I remind members of the coalition that under the IR Act as it was non-union members did not have access to the Industrial Relations Commission. I would have thought that the members of the coalition would at least recognise that as part of the IR Reform Act the influence of unions again was greatly diminished in that way. Of course, the Industrial Relations Act as it was provided even less flexibility than the current version does. This is not a particularly logical position and certainly will not attract our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise our position, we accept the delay in abolishing award youth rates, but the proposed limits on the unfair dismissal remedy are, in our view, both unfair and premature. We will be looking to provide low income earners with better access to justice. We call on the government to listen to its own conscience and to support our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) addresses two key issues: the postponement of previous provisions preventing age discrimination awards and agreements, and the supposed clarification of the operation of the termination of employment provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. I wish to comment briefly on both issues. While there is little doubt the bill will be passed with the combined vote of the economic fundamentalist coalition on both sides of this chamber, I feel it is important to place an alternative perspective on the record because it reflects a broader community consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it should be stated that the Greens (WA) do not accept the argument that the anti-discrimination provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act should be suspended in relation to young workers in this country. As the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, or AYPAC, stated in its submission to EPAC prior to this year's budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people are entitled to a living income. Whilst acquiring work experience is crucial, it should not be a mechanism for exploitation. AYPAC regards competency, not age, as the crucial determinant for wage income. AYPAC has consistently advocated the removal of youth provisions from industrial awards.</PARA>
<PARA>The document goes on to refute a number of arguments in relation to this issue. These relate to social needs, productivity, low wages as incentives for training and the impact of increased youth wages on unemployment levels. The arguments put by this AYPAC are so concise and clear that I will quote briefly from its budget submission in relation to these issues. The document is entitled `Young People and the 1994 Federal Budget.' I quote the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of paying young people lower wages than adult workers is based on a number of unsustainable arguments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Young people do not have the same social needs as older workers (such as families to support) and should be paid less. This concept of `social need' has been applied to wage determinations for most of this century and has been the philosophical underpinning of reduced wages for women and Aboriginals. This argument also implies that young people receive some form of parental support, when, in fact, many young people who are working and living at home contribute to the household from their earnings and receive no financial support from their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Young people are less productive and less competent than older workers. Some employers consider that young people are, by virtue of their age, immature and inexperienced. Physical labour performed by a junior worker may have a higher work value than an older worker but would automatically be paid the lower youth wage. Similarly, a young clerical worker with knowledge and skills on computers and new technologies is assumed to be less skilled that an older clerical worker and paid less regardless of either person's actual skill level. AYPAC believes that young people in employment must be paid on the basis of competency, not age, and age discrimination must be removed from industrial awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Lower wages provide an incentive for young people to remain in training and/or education instead of entering the work force. It is assumed young people are easily tempted by the immediate gratification of a waged income. It is assumed that high wage incomes may induce young people to desert education or training (perceived as having a long term benefit) and that this would not be good for the overall quality of the Australian work force. There is no evidence to substantiate this argument. In fact, data indicates that an increasing number of young people are staying in education when (if employment opportunities were available) they could be receiving an adult wage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Increasing youth wages would cause an increase in youth unemployment and a decrease in youth wages would cause a decrease in unemployment. International and Australian research indicates that there is inconclusive evidence to support this assertion. Youth unemployment cannot be attributed to "high" youth wages. In fact, youth wages are 5 per cent lower in real terms than they were a decade ago. Spiralling youth unemployment is primarily attributable to major structural changes in the nature of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA>These arguments are not new. Groups such as AYPAC have been pursuing this issue for many years and government departments and parliamentary committees have similarly examined the question of youth wages. Why, then, do we need to delay any further the implementation of competency based awards for young people in the work force? Are we to continue to allow some employers to exploit the youth of this nation with wage levels below the poverty line?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this is yet another example of the election-driven NIMTOO approach by this government. It is not prepared to make the difficult decisions and continues to say `Not in my term of office'! A three-year delay in the implementation of the youth discrimination provisions will, of course, conveniently delay the decision until after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second question in relation to the government's backdown on the issue of the termination of employment provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act, I can only say that the government's actions do not surprise me. Yet again, the government appears ultimately to pay greater heed to the interests of employers rather than the workers in this country. This is yet more evidence of the government's desire to provide a free market for industry with little or no regulation and little or no taxation. The theory is that by providing these `incentives' then industry will provide employment opportunities and a stimulus to the economy and that the benefits ultimately will trickle down to the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this approach is that industry does not seem to understand its part in the bargain. As I stated in a recent speech in this place, industry groups in Western Australia or their spokespeople have clearly stated that their first responsibility is to their shareholders and that they do not see that they have any responsibility to the community to solve problems such as unemployment. If therefore the government is providing a free market for industry in order that it can solve our economic problems and at the same time industry is absolving itself of any of these responsibilities, I would like to know who is going to take that responsibility. In the context of this bill, who will protect employees from unscrupulous employers in circumstances related to termination of employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been contacted, as I imagine have a number of others in this place, by people who are currently going through the process of appeal against unfair dismissal. I think that it is unfair that changes of this kind should be made before any of the results of those appeals are known. I concur with Senator Bell that it simply does not make sense that the legislation is changed on the basis that it is all too difficult, before we know how it works in the first place. The Greens do not support the provisions contained in this bill and see no logical rationale for amending the provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 which was passed by this parliament late last year. We will not be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2) endeavours to answer widespread criticism of the termination provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Act. There has been a good deal of publicity surrounding criticism not only from employers but from a wider sector of the community in relation to the provisions in that act. One of the comments made by Mr Brereton was that this bill seeks to share the onus of proof between employer and employee. I wish to address my remarks to perhaps two or three points contained in the bill and will leave other comments to the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of the bill provides that if somebody is not employed under award conditions and earns more than $60,000, he or she is not protected by the termination provisions in this bill. Such people have to resort to common law and the costly options have already been outlined by Senator Bell. It may be that at the end of the day the costs outlaid in seeking some remedy in the courts will far outweigh the gain. Therefore, I believe that in the first instance there is some discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the government to article 2 of the ILO termination convention which states that the convention applies to `all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons.' I believe the question of whether one works under an award or not should make no difference. I support the amendments which are foreshadowed by the coalition and which will seek to remove any reference to anyone working under an award. I believe there should be no such distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is the onus of proof that causes me most concern. If one makes an application under section 170EA of the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;relating to an employee making an application in relation to an allegedly unfair dismissal&mdash;the employer has the onus of establishing that the dismissal was for a valid reason. In regard to clause 7 of this bill there are two references&mdash;the first relating to section 170DE and the second to section 170DF. A reason is not valid if having regard to the employee's capacity and conduct in those operational requirements the termination is harsh, unjust or unreasonable. The other provision is to the effect that an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for any one or more of certain reasons. It mentions temporary absence relating to illness, union activities, race, colour, sexual preference and also absence from work during maternity leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could understand that in modern Australia those are perhaps valid reasons for being absent from work and that they should not attract any sanction as such if legitimately maintained by the employee. But the problem is that the onus of establishing that in this bill falls upon the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At common law it is the plaintiff who has the onus of proof, and normally it is proof on the balance of probabilities. If we allege something at law the onus is upon us to prove the matter. That is a matter of law and commonsense. The person who is making the application under clause 170EA is the employee. It is the employee who is alleging unfair dismissal. Therefore I believe that the onus of proof incorrectly falls on the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In modern Australia the trade unions play an important role in the industrial courts. Workers have the ability to be represented by trade unions. It is not as if it falls upon the worker to present his case on his own; he has the resources of the trade union to assist him. I do not take any issue with that. However, the worker is not at such a disadvantage that he should not bear the normal onus of proof at common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill there is supposed to be a sharing of the onus: that is, the applicant has the onus of establishing any other elements in the case. It still falls upon the employer in the first instance. I believe that that is inappropriate in Australia today. Employers should not bear that onus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much discussion about a cap in compensation. I can understand why the government has raised this issue. There is some reverse discrimination against people under an award because a person earning over $60,000 who is not under an award goes to common law and can perhaps get much greater compensation. I mentioned earlier that that person could well suffer the other edge of the sword: that is, having to outlay the money and not getting compensation sufficient to meet his costs. In the end it is a pyrrhic victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for a worker under an award the other edge of the sword is that he could obtain a much greater award of compensation. I believe that there is another angle of discrimination between those under an award and those not under an award. A person with a salary of $60,000 is not the average worker. I see that Senator Bell agrees with me. Discrimination can work both ways: it can work against the worker under an award and against the person who is not under an award. I believe that this proposed legislation is flawed. An employee employed under an award has a cap of either six months compensation or $30,000, whichever is the lesser. I understand that the Democrats propose as a compromise that it should be whichever is the greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there should not be a choice at all. If there is to be a cap, then six months compensation would be appropriate. We could have a person in a job who is on a vastly different salary from another person, and six months salary could mean a great deal more. I believe it is fairer to attach the compensation to the salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that this bill cures the complaints made about the Industrial Relations Act. As a person who has employed people over 13 or 14 years, I can say that there certainly should be rules as to how people have their employment terminated. In a fair society one expects that an employer should go about things in a reasonable manner and that there should be such things as notice, and payment in lieu of notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, at the end of the day, we cannot make employers hidebound by such regulations, because we will have a downturn in employment. We will have employers resorting to the use of consultants and all sorts of artificial methods of employment in order to sidestep the regulations. We can hardly blame them for that when we look at the onerous provisions contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not in the interests of employers or employees. I believe that an employer should have the right to sack a worker where there is a question as to the worker's diligence or his ability to carry out his or her duties. That is basic commonsense. This country cannot run on anything but that. If we make the provisions of termination of employment too difficult and too unwieldy, and if we impose burdens upon small employers particularly, in the long run employment will suffer. The next step follows as night follows day: the country as a whole will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to strike a balance between economic viability and fairness. The government is incapable of doing that. I am not going to indulge in rhetoric against the unions and I will not countenance rhetoric against employers because that misses the point. </PARA>

It is also his right to terminate employment, and to do so on fair grounds; grounds that are acceptable to the community as a whole. But it is not sufficient to invoke complicated and regulated methods which will just see more and more disputes in industrial relations courts. That is no recipe for success. It is no recipe for consensus in the industrial arena. </PARA>

Fairness does not involve any breach of long accepted legal principles of the onus of proof. Any tinkering or any sort of messing around with it will only end up in disaster.

<PARA>These amendments relate to clause 6 of the bill. As we heard in the debate on the second reading, this bill will restrict access to the Industrial Relations Court for unfair dismissal. To be covered by the unfair dismissal provisions, employees must have no adequate alternative remedy, be working under either federal or state awards, or be earning up to $60,000 a year. The clause discriminates between award and non-award employees and demonstrates yet again that the Labor government's industrial relations policy is designed for the fat cats in the trade union movement. It is certainly not meant for the ordinary working men and women of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four amendments that I have moved seek to remove the discrimination that exists under the government's proposed legislation between award and non-award employees with regard to access to unfair termination provisions. The provisions allow award employees unlimited access to unfair dismissal provisions but discriminate against non-award employees by restricting access to those earning less than $60,000 a year. As I said, it exempts the union fat cats from the income cap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, introduced by Mr Brereton in the other place, the government deliberately discriminates against non-award employees. That becomes clear when we look at their access to unfair dismissal compensation and to the court to take action against unfair dismissal. In this legislation there is unlimited access to those unfair dismissal provisions, irrespective of income, provided the employees concerned are under an award. Yet non-award employees in similar situations have access to unfair dismissal provisions only if they are earning less than $60,000 per year. We believe that is grossly unfair and an example of gross discrimination. That is why I have moved these amendments. I feel they warrant the support of the committee and I urge the committee to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments prevent award employees who earn more than $60,000 a year from making an unfair dismissal claim in the Industrial Relations Court. They are ostensibly based on the premise that award employees should be treated in the same way as non-award employees, who would be excluded by this legislation if they earn more than $60,000. While the Australian Democrats agree that award and non-award employees should be treated in the same way, we feel that regard should be had for the purpose of this legislation, which is to provide an accessible remedy to low and middle income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Award workers fall into these income brackets pretty well automatically but non-award salaries range much higher. Presumably, that is the government's reason for prescribing an upper salary limit for non-award employees. It is not usually necessary in the case of those with awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the debate on the second reading, the Democrats are not convinced that these exclusions are necessary. While we believe that high income earners should not clog up the new court at the expense of those on more modest salaries, we have not been presented with any information to show that is actually happening, even though we have asked to be provided with such information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the evidence suggests the need for a salary cut-off for non-award employees, we have been presented with no justification for the choice of $60,000 as the limit. We suggest that that is an arbitrary decision. It may be the figure is too low; then again, it may be that most non-award employees above that salary are on contracts which include termination provisions, and that makes the argument academic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the case, the Democrats are not interested in further limiting access to this remedy, which is the real purpose of the opposition's amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept the opposition's proposal that all employees who earn more than $60,000 should be excluded from access to these remedies. The government's objective is not to indiscriminately exclude every employee who earns more than that particular amount. Instead, the government has adopted an approach which effectively ensures that employees who are high income earners, and who can broadly be described as managerial, are excluded from the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Very few, if any, non-managerial employees who are not covered by an award earn a base annual salary of more than $60,000. Employees covered by awards are much less likely to be managerial, and that reflects the composition of trade unions which obtain to such awards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just heard from Senator Bell on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and the minister on behalf of the government, merely reinforces why the opposition amendments should be supported. Both Senator Bell and the minister have said that virtually no-one on an award would be earning more than $60,000 per annum. If that is the case, why not bite the bullet, remove the discrimination which clearly exists in this legislation, and have the $60,000 per annum cap apply to both award and non-award employees? There has been no argument put forward as to why that cap should not apply equally to both. As I have said, both Senator Bell and the minister have reinforced the very reason why it should apply to both, because they have said that virtually no award employees would be above the $60,000 per annum cap anyway.

<PARA>This amendment to clause 7 relates to the onus of proof provisions in the legislation with regard to unfair dismissal. The opposition believes that the current legislation puts an unfair burden on the employer with regard to the onus of proof that an employee has been unfairly dismissed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment seeks to transfer the onus of proof in an unfair dismissal case to the employee. The government's formulation of proposed section 170EDA(1) requires an employer to prove that he or she has a valid reason for dismissing an employee. If a valid reason is proven then the onus is on the employee to show that the dismissal was nevertheless harsh, unjust or unreasonable. The opposition's formulation simply requires the employee to show that the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. It removes the employer's responsibility and thereby changes the balance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Questions of onus of proof are never easy to resolve anywhere in the law. This particular bill, I think, gives it some balance. The employer is in the best position to know the actual reasons for termination, so it is appropriate that the employer be required to establish that there was in fact a reason for going to the employee's capacity or conduct or the operational requirements of the employer's enterprise. Indeed, when it comes to the operational requirements, the employer may well be the only person who can establish why such a termination was decided upon.

It is required in the rules of the court that he will provide that information so that the employee will have before him information about why he or she was dismissed. But that does not negate the need for the employee, who as the appellant is taking the action, actually to establish the unfair dismissal.

<PARA>Of these four amendments, Nos 6 to 9 deal with clause 8 and relate to compensation, and No. 10 deals with clause 9 and is consequential on the passing of amendments Nos 6 to 9. These amendments deal with the mirror image of the access to compensation; they deal with the amount of compensation that is available to an employee who successfully prosecutes an unfair dismissal case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 1 to 4, which I moved earlier in the evening&mdash;which unfortunately were not passed&mdash;dealt with access to the unfair dismissal provisions of the legislation. These latter amendments deal with the actual amount of compensation that can be paid in the case of a successful prosecution of an unfair dismissal case. As I said with regard to those earlier amendments, in this legislation there is a clear discrimination between employees under an award and employees not under an award with regard to access to the unfair dismissal provisions. Exactly the same discrimination is present in the legislation with regard to the amount of compensation that is available to employees who are under an award as against those employees who are not under an award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, where an employee who has been unfairly dismissed successfully establishes that case of unfair dismissal but the court does not order reinstatement, then compensation is payable as an alternative. Under the bill, there is discrimination between award and non-award employees with regard to the amount of that compensation. The bill says in clause 3(a) that no employee can receive more than six months compensation, but that in addition, under 3(b) non-award employees cannot receive more than $30,000&mdash;that is, the applicable amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, an employee under an award can obtain six months wages or six months salary as compensation with no upper limit on the amount of compensation payable. Yet an employee who is not under an award is limited to a maximum of six months salary or wages, and is also subject to an upper limit of $30,000. So if the six months payment would be more than $30,000 that employee can only take the lesser of the six months pay or the $30,000 upper limit. So there is again unfair discrimination between award and non-award employees. The income cap, as we have already found with regard to non-award employees, is $60,000 and, therefore, the limit to any payout to a non-award employee is $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 6 to 9 are a combination of amendments that give effect to our intention to ensure that this discrimination between award and non-award employees is removed from the legislation. That simply limits compensation to a six months payout; it does not have the additional limit on non-award employees of a $30,000 cap. We believe that fairness requires that these particular amendments be passed, because the discrimination against non-award employees ought to be removed from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assume that we will hear from the minister on this. I put to him the argument that the discriminatory compensation provisions in this legislation as it currently stands should be removed. Where there is no reinstatement and compensation is paid instead, the provisions applying to award employees on the one hand and non-award employees on the other should be the same. Provisions for both should apply to a maximum annual salary of $60,000 with, therefore, a maximum payout of $30,000, or six months wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to my earlier amendments, the minister said that there is not much point in having a cap with regard to access to the compensation provisions. I expect he will promote the same argument in relation to these amendments. It is a re-run of the argument put in the other place by the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Gary Johns, when he told the House of Representatives that people employed on awards and earning more than $60,000 a year comprise only 0.25 per cent of the work force. Yet this government wants to have special discriminatory provisions in favour of that elite 0.25 per cent. You cannot get much more elite than that&mdash;the 0.25 per cent club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to tell me who are the people who are exempted from the capping provision by having no cap applying to employees under awards. As I understand it, in Australia we now have a work force of 8,718,700 people; 0.25 per cent of that represents 5,449. I would like the minister in his response to tell me who are these people that earn&mdash;</PARA>

Are they union officials? Are there any women among them? Are there any bus drivers, any carpenters, any plumbers among them? Just who comprises this elite club&mdash;the 0.25 per cent club&mdash;who are on award conditions, yet earn more than $60,000 a year, and who will have special provisions made for them under this legislation that do not apply to non-award employees earning similar relatively high levels of income?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is incumbent on the minister, it having been indicated by his colleague in the other place that they are in fact only 0.25 per cent of the work force, to tell me who indeed these people are. The government in pushing forward this legislation really ought to identify who it intends to benefit with this particular exemption. Is it ordinary workers who are going to benefit from this exemption? That is simply not the case when we are talking about incomes in excess of $60,000 per year. Or is it the trade union fat cats who seem to be the masters of this government's industrial relations legislation who are going to benefit from this particular exemption?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is the trade union fat cats who probably make up this 0.25 per cent who will be benefiting from this exemption. If that is not the case, I want the minister to tell me who is, because this legislation in its present form is completely discriminatory and that discrimination ought to be removed. It is the purpose of our amendments to remove that discrimination and I urge the support of the committee for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments remove the $30,000 cap for non-award employees and make the cap a straight six months salary. The beneficiaries of this change would appear to be non-award employees on high incomes. If non-award employees are on a salary of $65,000 a year for the six months before dismissal, having been on $55,000 for the six months before that, then they will have earned $60,000 for the previous 12 months which would make them just eligible to make a claim. But under the existing legislation these people would be limited to compensation of $30,000. Under the opposition's amendments they would be entitled to something like $32,500, which is the six months salary at the rate just before dismissal. That would mean, as I said earlier, that the beneficiaries would be people who are on high salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that low income earners should be the principal beneficiaries of this legislation and any changes to the compensation cap should be in their direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of very brief remarks. This clause of the bill, I understand, is based on ILO convention 158. If the previous terms of the bill were in conformity with 158, how can the current changes proposed by the government also be in conformity with 158? That is my first question. My second question is: is there anything in ILO convention 158 which calls for the exclusion of people from its terms on the basis of income? I would like that point to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a sad thing when the legality of the laws of this land is determined in Geneva. I put that point to the minister and ask whether this can be appealed to Geneva by an employer group or an employee group, to determine whether it is legal?</PARA>

Senator Chapman threw a big spear in the air and said, `This is really to help out union officials.' I do not know of a paid union official who works under an award rate, certainly not for this particular amount. They are all basically in the non-award area. After a very sensible and balanced debate so far we went off on that bit of a romp on which I cannot agree with Senator Chapman. I have to disappoint him.

<PARA>Our amendments aim to make the compensation cap fairer. We are proposing that the maximum amount a person can claim cannot be reduced lower than $30,000. The amendments state that any employee can claim $30,000 or six months salary, whichever is the greater. For the opposition's enlightenment, I emphasise that this benefit applies equally to award and non-award employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this change is that any cap will unfairly disadvantage a small minority of employees who will not be adequately compensated even when they receive the maximum possible amount. I have previously given examples, such as long-serving employees who would otherwise have received larger redundancy payments, people in higher age groups who are several years from retirement but who have no realistic prospect of re-employment, and also people who have low skill levels and therefore have reduced prospects of re-employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people, the only way to claim more than the cap allows is to take a common law action, but the threshold costs of taking a common law action are high. If somebody on $20,000 a year believes he is entitled to 12 months salary, the legal cost of doing so via the common law would be so high that the claim would not be worth pursuing. For somebody who is earning $50,000 a year, a common law claim for 12 months salary is therefore much more viable. We have rehearsed that; we have gone through that. It seems as though the chamber actually agrees with it. I want to see whether the chamber is prepared to vote to achieve a redressing of that injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that common law action is very expensive and the costs do not fall if the income of the person taking the action is low. It is the Democrats' view that the cap should not be able to fall below a certain amount, and that should be the amount at which common law action is still a viable alternative. We have decided that that figure is $30,000, and that is what these amendments seek to achieve. We have put this forward as a test of the commitment of the government and the opposition to fairness and access to justice. It seems to us that both major parties have a great deal of difficulty in matching their rhetoric with action in those areas of fairness and access to justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be supporting these amendments moved by Senator Bell on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I make the point in the first instance that Senator Bell claims that his amendments remove the discrimination from the legislation which I complained about and sought to address in the amendments that I earlier moved on behalf of the opposition. Senator Bell's amendments do nothing of the sort. They make absolutely no change to the government's provisions in this legislation which discriminate with regard to access to the unfair dismissal provisions because they still leave the government's legislation in place with regard to that access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as award employees are concerned there is unlimited access to the unfair dismissal provisions but for non-award employees there is a cap of $60,000 per annum in wages or salary above which a non-award employee cannot seek the remedy of unfair dismissal. Therefore, that discrimination remains in place under the Democrats' amendments. The Democrats claim that the amendments remove the discrimination as far as the compensation payable is concerned but, if people do not have the access in the first place because they are discriminated against as non-award employees, the amount of compensation remains meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other shortcoming of these amendments is that they provide for compensation of up to six months wages or salary or $30,000, whichever is the greater. In other words, they provide in effect a minimum of $30,000 compensation irrespective of the annual income of the person who has successfully taken a claim under unfair dismissal. We believe that six months salary is adequate compensation in that regard where reinstatement is not ordered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these two reasons&mdash;firstly, the fact that the amendments do not really do anything about discrimination and, secondly, we believe there ought to be a cap of a maximum of six months salary or $30,000, whichever is the lesser&mdash;we will not be supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I simply want to make the point that I hope the business community and employers will note that both the government and the Democrats have failed in their treatment of this legislation to do anything to make it easier to employ people. The government and the Democrats have retained discrimination in the legislation against non-award employees and have failed in this legislation to place any reasonable cap on pay-outs in the case of compensation awards in relation to unfair dismissal. This will leave business in general, and small business in particular, in an unenviable position. Also, the legislation as it stands does nothing to change the onus of proof in regard to a case of unfair dismissal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994 is an important piece of legislation. However, I do not think a long debate on its provisions will change the positions that are fairly apparent around the chamber. Therefore, I will take account of the time at which this matter is being debated. This bill contains changes to Commonwealth legislation to enable the Australian Capital Territory to set up its own public service. It will amend the ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988, the Public Service Act 1922 and the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the establishment of the ACT Government Service as an historic, important and necessary step by the ACT on the road to total self-determination. We supported the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives, although we had some reservations because of many issues in the bill which have been, and still are, the subject of disagreement between the ACT and the federal government and the relevant unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These contentious issues include staff movements, known as mobility, between the ACT Government Service and the Australian Public Service; portability of leave credits for officers returning to the APS from the ACT Government Service, or on appointment to the ACT Government Service from the APS. They include the rights of APS officers who, after being compulsorily transferred to the ACT Government Service, are declared excess within a short period; and the lack of clarity about the roles to be played in the ACT Government Service by the Merit Protection Review Agency and the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the government has attempted to address these issues through amendments to the bill and, in the case of the redundancy provisions, a change to administrative orders. The government has proposed the following: all leave credits for transferring and promoted officers will be able to be transferred between the services; mobility provisions be extended to APS officers who are compulsorily transferred to the ACT government service to allow them, for one year only on the government's proposal, to apply for transfer back to the APS under section 50 of the Public Service Act; for ACT government service employees appointed to the APS, prior service in the ACT government service will be counted as service in the APS; probation periods for officers in the ACT government service, whether ex-APS or ex-ACT, will be counted as probation served in the APS should they be appointed to the APS; the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 be amended to allow the merit protection agency to perform protective functions on behalf of the ACT government service; and the ACT Legislative Assembly be given the power, which currently rests with the Commonwealth, to overturn decisions of the remuneration tribunal relating to certain ACT government service employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, the government has also proposed that APS officers compulsorily transferred to the ACT government service, and who are subsequently made redundant, in addition to their ability to seek positions in the ACT government service and the APS in the usual manner, will also be able to seek non-merit section 50 transfers to the APS within the first two years of the start date of the ACT government service. I understand that this is purely an administrative matter and not subject to legislative amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that this change is fair in its application to APS staff compulsorily transferred to the ACT government service who face retrenchment shortly thereafter. Despite the proposed amendments and changes, the public service unions and the Trades and Labour Council are still not satisfied; so much so that they have referred various matters raised in this bill, including the mobility provisions, to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As I understand it, that matter is still part heard and is to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, therefore, do we have this unsatisfactory state of affairs? It was principally because in May 1992 the ACT's Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, as part of a joint statement with the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, on the establishment of a separate ACT public service, gave an assurance that ACT public servants would not be disadvantaged by the move and that there would be full mobility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that the ACT Labor Government did not consider the impact of this promise on the independence of both services. It might be asked whether it considered whether this in fact would work. The bottom line is that this is another broken promise. The broken promise has upset the public servants; it has upset the unions, and the unions have taken their case to the Industrial Relations Commission, and this very unsatisfactory state of affairs continues to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the ACT government break its promise? We are suggesting that perhaps it had not thought through the consequences of that promise. I guess why is something for the government to answer rather than for us to speculate upon. In any event, the situation is, as I said, a very disappointed ACT public service; one that we have tried to give some support to by the amendments that I will refer to shortly. Also, because the matter is still before the Industrial Relations Commission we are faced with the prospect that, upon arbitration, the decision of the commission could in fact override the consequence of this legislation; and I say that by virtue of the application of section 121 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which I remind you, Mr Deputy President, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to an industrial dispute involving public sector employment, the Commission may, where it considers it proper to do so, make an award or order that is not, or in its opinion may not be, consistent with a relevant law of the Commonwealth or of an internal Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that certain undertakings had been given by the government to the unions that in the event that the commission makes a finding that is inconsistent with this legislation&mdash;in particular with regard to the section 50 transfers&mdash;the government is going to legislate again in accordance with that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all that amounts to is that this bill is presented to us in a very unsatisfactory state. It is a pity that the government could not get its relations with the unions settled and this arbitration settled before the bill is put to this chamber. As I said, it should not be misunderstood that the reason why it has been unable to do that is because it made representations to public servants and held out a situation that it was not prepared to honour, and it is that disappointment that has caused the public servants and their unions to take this action. The responsibility for the unsatisfactory state of affairs that flows from this must be borne by Chief Minister Follett and Prime Minister Keating, who have jointly breached their promise to ACT public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mobility provisions as they stand allow for all ACT government service officers to compete on merit for positions in either service. This is a concession that no other public service in Australia has, but is one which we believe is necessary to maintain the vitality of both services and encourage good people to stay with the ACT government service. In supporting the government's position on mobility on merit, the coalition recognises that the ACT is a unique employment environment. As we know, it has no strong industrial or manufacturing base which might provide sufficient alternative employment to people in the ACT. The public service will remain in the foreseeable future the major employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mobility on merit will result in improved public sector performance as effort is rewarded; it will promote greater flexibility in the public sector by allowing recruitment from a wider base; and it will increase opportunities for officers to enhance their experiences and abilities by encouraging mobility between agencies and services. The coalition, therefore, strongly supports the concept of mobility on merit. It is for that reason that the coalition decided, in concert with the ACT opposition leader, Kate Carnell, to propose an amendment to the bill to improve mobility provisions for former APS officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment provides that mobility provisions between the APS and the ACT government service be extended to allow those APS public servants, who are compulsorily transferred to the ACT government service, to have two years in which to transfer back to the APS under the provisions of section 50 of the Public Service Act, should they wish to. The Labor Government's compromise that it is going to put to the chamber tonight is in similar terms, but for one year. That is pretty disappointing when the government's promise was for total mobility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think that is a sufficient window of opportunity. That is why our amendment is in terms of two years. I might say that if we had not gone down that path, and if the Australian Democrats had not publicly expressed support for our position, there would be no compromise coming from the government at all on that issue tonight. I hope the numbers will stand and that we will be able to offer to APS public servants the two years that will give them that little bit of extra flexibility in planning their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In proposing two years, we have recognised that APS recruitment and appointment procedures for people trying to secure appointment in advertised vacancies are excruciatingly slow, never mind for those trying to secure a section 50 transfer. While the coalition would like to see an ACT public service up and running and is willing to agree to the amendments, with the one exception that I have mentioned, the manner in which this issue has been handled by the government is clearly abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was to have been introduced into the parliament last year but the government failed to get the agreement of the unions and introduced the bill this session instead. That was at very short notice and the government had to seek our agreement to the introduction and passage in the one session, a legislative process contrary to the one to which it had earlier pledged to adhere. Nevertheless, we agreed. The government also had to do it without the support of the unions. Because of the internal affairs of the ALP, that meant that the government was in the position I outlined earlier of having to give the undertaking that it would amend this bill if arbitration led to a different conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation today is only marginally different from that which the government faced last year. It follows that unless the government ultimately accepts the union line and grants full mobility or section 50 transfers the unions will not be satisfied and will continue to pursue their options through the commission, possibly even through the courts. From that perspective, it had been an unsatisfactory start to the business of the new public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I note that the ACT is well on the way to complete autonomy. In that context, it is natural for the territory to have its own independent public service. It would be foolish to aspire to such autonomy while still in effect sharing a public service with the Commonwealth. It is unfortunate that this bill, which should have been a pleasure to pass tonight, has been the subject of so much conjecture. The coalition is disappointed by the breach of trust on the part of the ACT Labor government and the Federal Labor government&mdash;going back on the much publicised promise to ACT public servants of full mobility provisions between the APS and the ACT government service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debacle of tonight's legislation highlights once again the Labor government's inability to keep its promises to the electorate&mdash;something so familiar to us from its broken tax promises and other broken promises&mdash;its habit of seeking to buy votes with promises of things that it cannot deliver, its failure to consider the consequences of its promises, its inability to work on a Commonwealth-state level, and its inability to negotiate realistic and equitable outcomes with the unions, its political bedfellows. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994, I support much of what Senator Hill has said about the need for proper provisions for mobility and the concerns he expressed about the original propositions. However, I also support the government in bringing this bill forward at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gained my first impression of this legislation&mdash;you would be pleased to know this, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;because of concern expressed by the scrutiny of bills committee about the capacity of this legislation to work in concert with the complementary legislation passed by the ACT Assembly. I sought to find out the effect of this bill on those at whom it was directed&mdash;the ACT public servants and those who would become part of the service. Being without a full knowledge of the history of this particular piece of legislation, I contacted several people who would be involved&mdash;including unionists and those following the debate through the ACT legislature&mdash;and received a series of replies from a pretty comprehensive cross-section of people in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order of decreasing importance, the items of concern to employees are as follows: the right to return to the federal Public Service rather than be made redundant by the ACT government; the option of taking payouts for present leave entitlements and having to start again&mdash;which would prevent the ACT from incurring debt&mdash;versus carrying entitlements across to the ACT Public Service; avoidance of superannuation problems by using the existing federal Public Service PSS or CSS schemes, as proposed by the ACT; the desire for equivalent pay scales for equivalent positions; the effect of length and continuity of service on career prospects and leave entitlements; the loss of career prospects and job security resulting from being part of a smaller and isolated public service; provision of equivalent conditions of service, such as hours of work, recreation leave, sick leave, parenting leave and long service leave entitlements; and the level of positions available in the ACT Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken that reaction into account in looking at the government's revised and renegotiated position and the amendments proposed by Senator Hill. Quite frankly, it became apparent early in the public debate on this matter that the most important thing&mdash;it is at the top of the list I just gave&mdash;was the provision of mobility. One year as a compromise was almost meaningless; two years was to some extent satisfactory, even though at the end of the two years there would still be people disadvantaged by this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As Senator Hill said, I publicly indicated that the Democrats would be supporting the amendments proposed by him. The Democrats have a philosophical position whereby we support the movement towards a situation where there is mobility between all states and territories for Commonwealth public servants. That is for this reason: if we had competency based pay throughout Australia, if we had competency based certification throughout the education system, the public would be better served by a public service, in the truest sense, making best use of the talents and skills available throughout the country. It could therefore be predicted that we could support the amendments proposed by Senator Hill. I will not enter into the argument about whether this represents a breach of promise or about what Mr Keating or Ms Follett did or did not arrange or announce in May 1992 or any subsequent time&mdash;that would be fruitless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a bill, the subject of consideration by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, about which the public sector unions are not in agreement even though there was sufficient time in which to reach agreement with those proposing the bill&mdash;a messy situation. That mess could have been resolved by more direct leadership, exhibiting a sense of purpose about the bill and what it was supposed to achieve. However, I will not stand in the way of the progress of this debate or of the passage of this bill. I have said all that I need to say. The Democrats will support the amendments proposed by Senator Hill and we will support the passage of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity we are discussing this matter so late at night and that it clearly is more important to have the legislation passed than to spend a great deal of time going over the issues, many of which have already been dealt with. I would refer to the second reading speech, which I think fairly significantly sets out the history of the devolution of the ACT Public Service, and Senator Hill's speech, which dealt with the specific details of this legislation which, with the legislation passed in the ACT House of Assembly, will create the ACT Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the legislation was passed in 1988 and we have had an ACT government since May 1989, I certainly think it is absolutely appropriate that the ACT government have its own public service. Whether it actually needs 23,000 public servants is a matter for perhaps a different discussion altogether. But, whatever number is appropriate to run our small community, it should at least be a public service attached to the ACT government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pity of the situation at the moment is though, I think, the fact that this matter is not fully resolved. The legislation will have passed through the House of Assembly and through this parliament, and it will come into effect on 1 July, but there are still the matters outstanding, as have already been referred to, and many public servants are unhappy about what has been included and the way that this has been done. I think it perhaps would have been preferable if the Chief Minister had been a little less stubborn about 1 July being the starting date. She could have postponed it perhaps until September or December and seen that it was done properly with everybody understanding what was going on. There should never have been the sort of chaos we have had in the last few weeks with not only difficulties and distress for public servants but also an enormous loss of revenue from the bans placed in the ACT&mdash;loss of revenue relevant not to the ACT government but to the ACT taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 130 government amendments in the ACT House of Assembly to its own piece of legislation when it was finally put through at a special sitting last week. I think that too indicates that the matter has been rushed ahead of its time in the way that the legislation has been put together. This now, as I said, brings the ACT Public Service into being, which is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some exceptions which I would like to refer to and some of them are baffling. With ACTAB, the ACT Totalisator Agency Board, one can only feel very sorry indeed for its employees and what they have had to go through in recent times. They apparently will remain outside the legislation until at least 1 January 1995. Of course, there is enormous uncertainty about their employment and position at present as a result of certain activities. I do not know what we would call those activities, but really the arrangement that was supposed to be put into place with VITAB&mdash;</PARA>

As I have said, the end result is that those employed there, I think, have been through a terrible time of uncertainty as to the fate of their own jobs and that of the agency itself. But that, I think understandably perhaps but unfortunately, has been left out. The Legal Aid Commission is outside the legislation. The fire brigade, for some reason that mystifies me completely, apparently is not to be part of this legislation, as well as ACTAID, Total Care and the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers. A little more time may have enabled it all to be done somewhat better than it has been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the assembly Mrs Carnell, as the Liberal leader, made it clear that the theme of the legislation, as she saw it, was that the Public Service was there to serve the government and its political ends more than to serve the public. One would hope that is not the case because that certainly is not what any public service should be, and I think the public expects and deserves better than that. Appointments and promotions are to be centralised and risk then being open to political direction or patronage, which is, again, something I think the public ought to be protected from. It is strange indeed that at a time when other state and federal bureaucracies are commercialising, devolving and privatising, the ACT government seems to have set up a public service which is more likely to be uniform, standardised and centralised. That too is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a unique situation to have a city, as Canberra is, with two seats of government. I have no doubt though that any difficulties which may appear to exist will be resolved. The question of mobility has been mentioned, and I would refer to one letter which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> recently. It had been written by Mr Ned McGrath, who is well known to many of us as a former public servant of the Department of Capital Territory, a very knowledgeable man who knew the Public Service and what went on around him extremely well. He referred to the fact that, in earlier times, back in the 1970s, successive Liberal ministers had promised full mobility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think with the nature of the Public Service in the 1970s, full mobility was something we would have thought was a pretty reasonable proposition. I no longer think it is. There have been enormous changes to the Public Service in the last 10 years, some of them good and some of them not so good, but significant changes which I think would lead anyone to the conclusion that full mobility is less appropriate now than it might have been when self-government was being discussed in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McGrath also went on to point out that, in quite recent times with self-government being discussed, ALP ministers had agreed to full mobility and to the retention of conditions of employment. Certainly the Chief Minister of the ACT had promised mobility and no loss of conditions of service in transferring to the ACT. It seems extraordinary that those promises were made without knowing whether they could be delivered. I think that is perhaps what has caused a lot of the unhappiness, uncertainty and stress, to which Senator Bell referred, with people really believing that they had been told one thing and then suddenly finding they were facing up to something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think if public servants had been told initially exactly what the terms and conditions were to be, they would have had time to know what was occurring and that mobility was no longer an issue. But in the circumstances where people have been misled to the extent that they have been, I believe that our proposition of two years further being allowed is reasonable. One year is unreasonable; one year passes very quickly. I think two years gives people an opportunity to assess their situation and make a decision about whether they wish to remain with the ACT or attempt to transfer back to the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACT government public servants will have the opportunity to apply for jobs in the Australian Public Service on merit after that on a basis that is not available to public servants in other governments around Australia. I think that is appropriate, given the proximity of the two governments in one town. I would be disappointed if that at least was not preserved to ACT public servants serving the ACT government. As to the issue of full mobility, I do not agree that it should continue indefinitely but I most certainly support the two-year amendment that we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most disappointing part of this from a different point of view is the fact that the ACT government did not take the opportunity to include from the start whistleblowing legislation within its public service act. I think most governments are looking at whistleblowing legislation, as it is referred to, and I think it would have been an opportunity for the ACT government to have set the path to have had it included in its public service act right from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know what should be included. My Liberal colleagues in the assembly tabled, I think last February, a draft bill of the sort of legislation that they believe should be made available in the territory. It is a matter of considerable regret that lip-service is paid to these things but when the opportunity was there to put it in legislation it was not taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt there will be amendments and refinements from time to time but I welcome the legislation establishing the ACT public service. It is a proper consequence of ACT government and I support the amendment that we are making to the legislation and hope that those serving within it as from 1 July this year will find it a very satisfying and rewarding place to work and that many of them will wish to stay there and not take the opportunity to transfer out of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the three speakers for their contributions in the debate on the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill. I would just like to respond briefly. Senator Hill referred to this matter as a debacle, Senator Bell referred to it as messy and Senator Reid referred to it as chaos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject Senator Hill's assertion and his linking it with the theme of an ongoing litany of alleged breaches of promise as a consequence of the last election. We do not accept that as a theme. I would accept Senator Bell's observation&mdash;I do not take it as a criticism&mdash;that it is messy. But, frankly, any process that involves the creation of a new public service and separating that public service from an existing public service is not an easy job. Inevitably, when one has a complex series of negotiations with set deadlines, these sorts of things do become messy&mdash;they are never absolutely clean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid referred to chaos. Likewise, I reject that description of this approach. She referred to the 130 amendments that were moved in the ACT assembly. I think there are 10 plus one&mdash;11&mdash;that will be moved here. It is a tribute to the consultative process that those amendments and suggestions have been listened to and taken up by the ACT assembly. The exclusion of a number of organisations, legal aid, the fire brigade, Total Care and the ACT TAB is a decision taken by the ACT government. In the context of this legislation, I do not think it is appropriate to override that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Reid mentioned the issue of whistleblowing. At present we have a Senate committee looking at that. It is not appropriate to incorporate in legislation suggestions when we are awaiting the findings of the whistleblowing committee. There are nine government amendments that I will be moving, and I can indicate to the chamber that the suggestion of the opposition, which it will move as an amendment, allowing two years rather than 12 months as the transition period for public servants will be accepted by the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. A public hearing of the bill was held on 6 June 1994. Twelve submissions were received from a range of organisations including: the RSL; the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia National Council; the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia (New South Wales Branch); the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association of New South Wales; the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council; the Legacy Coordinating Council; the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Servicemen and Women Ltd; and the Veterans' Independent Consultation Group. A range of concerns was expressed to the committee, including the way the proposed Repatriation Medical Authority restricted rights of appeals, the lack of consultation and the delays which may be caused in finalising entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to encompass amendments to current legislation to implement part of the 1994-95 budget package for the veterans' affairs portfolio. It responds to some of the issues raised in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Fair Go</EMPHASIS>, the report on compensation for veterans and war widows by the Veterans' Compensation Review Committee, the so-called Baume report, in respect of the ageing of veterans of world wars and the different set of problems facing younger veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was first addressed on behalf of the coalition in the House of Representatives by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Wilson Tuckey, on 9 June. During that speech, on behalf of the coalition he indicated support for measures contained in the bill. The first is the special and intermediate rate pensions for severely disabled veterans of a relatively young age who never go back to work or can never support their families after returning from war. Change to the eligibility criteria will mean that these pensions will not normally be granted to veterans who are over 65. Exceptions will apply if the veteran was engaged in remunerative work after the age of 65, commenced prior to reaching 65, and in the same employment for 10 continuous years, demonstrating that it was a long-term intention to have a longer than normal working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Australian World War II merchant mariners will now receive the same rights and benefits as those available to World War II veterans under the VEA. Thirdly, with regard to claims for comparable foreign pension, existing service pensioners and claimants for service pension may be asked to take reasonable action to claim any overseas pension entitlements, thus reducing Australia's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the partner service pension allows the payment of a partner service pension to a widow, widower or separated spouse of an age or invalidity veteran service pension at the higher single rate, as is the case with social security pensions. Currently the lower or couple rate applies. Fifth, there is the income support supplement. War widows and widowers who currently receive an income support payment under the Social Security Act 1991 in addition to their veterans' pensions will now be able to receive the support payment under the VEA. They can remain with social security if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the time of his speech, the honourable member for O'Connor expressed his concern as to the likely outcome on the rights and entitlements of veterans due to the rigidity of the proposals in clause 11. Clause 11 proposes the creation of the Repatriation Medical Authority to issue principles relating to causation of various ailments now affecting veterans so as to identify any links those ailments might have with the veteran's service and therefore his or her right to certain entitlements. The explanatory memorandum describes the RMA and its functions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will be an independent body consisting of five eminent medical specialists. The members will be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the ex-service community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will prepare Statements of Principles based on sound medical-scientific evidence that will exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statements of Principles prepared by the Repatriation Medical Authority will be disallowable legislative instruments that will be binding on the Repatriation Commission, the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal to bind the Repatriation Commission and the various appeal tribunals associated with veterans' claims, the exclusivity and the tops down approach clearly would remove most opportunities for a veteran to appeal the original departmental decision, notwithstanding the government's promise to maintain the standard of proof mechanism of the reverse criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt based on a reasonable hypothesis. In fact, a legal opinion obtained by a veterans' organisation claims the proposed process would effectively negate the right of appeal on the grounds of medical causation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, along with most of the veterans' bodies, including the National President of the RSL, were quick to raise this particular issue. Nevertheless, in recognition of the positive aspects of the bill, the shadow minister, Wilson Tuckey, advised the parliament that the coalition was willing to assist the government to find a solution that addressed the problems but was fair to and protected the rights of individual veterans seeking compensation for present day ailments which they believe are service related. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of a very tight time frame, the coalition has achieved this task through negotiation with the Minister for  Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, Department of Veterans' Affairs officials and the veterans community. The solution is encapsulated in the amendment circulated to honourable senators, together with an explanatory memorandum, that I will move during the committee of the whole stage. I acknowledge and am grateful for the support of the minister, Con Sciacca, and the government in reaching this outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill we are considering this evening represents the first stage of the government's budget measures in the veterans' affairs portfolio. Before going on to the specifics of this particular piece of legislation, I would like to state that the Australian Democrats were pleased to see the allocation in the budget of additional funds for aged care and for carer education to assist veterans and war widows to stay in their own homes for as long as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also pleased to see the allocation of funds for the assistance of younger veterans. In this context, I would like to make special mention of the tireless work of the Vietnam veterans family support link line and its secretary, Mrs Doreen Smith. They have been the closest to the younger veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and have been directly affected by the health, social and vocational needs the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Sciacca) identified in his second reading speech. They have coped in the past without any recognition for their difficulties and I believe anything we can do to support the families of younger veterans, as well as the veterans themselves of course, is very worth while. I now turn to the measures in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were extremely pleased to see that at long last merchant mariners from World War II are to be brought under the aegis of the Veterans Entitlement Act. The Democrats, through my predecessors in this portfolio area, Senator Paul McLean and, before him, Senator Michael Macklin, spoke on this on a number of occasions and I am certainly very pleased that we have finally achieved this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have no problem with the measure, which will ensure that a member of a couple who subsequently ceases to be a member of that couple and has heretofore received half of the partnered rate on separation will now be entitled to receive the single rate. In the past such people have been forced to move to the higher social security pension and they will now be able to receive the higher rate from veterans affairs, thus removing the need for them to deal with two separate departments. Similarly, those who currently receive the income support supplement from the Department of Social Security can opt to have that payment made through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, this will abolish the need to deal with two separate departments, although, of course, those who opt to stay with social security can do so if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the measure which requires those who are entitled to an overseas pension to claim that pension. Although receipt of a foreign pension will count as income under the incomes test, veterans will still be better off as their Australian pension reduces only at the rate of 50c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the one measure in this bill with which we do still have some problems, and that is the process through which veterans have to go in order to claim a disability pension. We will all remember the panic measures which the government attempted to bring into this parliament within a week of the findings of the Bushell decision back in 1992. We will also remember that, following the referral of that legislation to the legal and constitutional affairs committee and the overwhelming evidence brought before that committee, the government was forced to withdraw those measures. Then we had an election and they disappeared altogether as the bill subsequently lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the government was giving us dire warnings about the floodgates opening as a result of the Bushell decision and enormous numbers of claims coming forward. That simply has not eventuated. Even so, we have been assured that veterans are indulging in `doctor shopping', as it is called, and that one or two `outrageous claims', in the government's words, have got through. But I also note here that there are those veterans who still believe that they have legitimate claims which have not been able to be heard under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been two recent reports critical of the compensation payments to veterans and war widows. The first was the Auditor-General's report which appeared at about the same time as the Bushell decision came down. The second was the report on compensation for veterans and war widows entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Fair Go</EMPHASIS>, commissioned by the former minister, Senator Faulkner, and led by Professor Peter Baume. This committee was required to consult with the Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' issues, which consists of members drawn from the ex-service community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the process by which this organisation works involves secrecy and its members were sworn to secrecy about the consultations they were engaged in during this process. I cannot believe that, following the mistrust generated in the veterans community as a result of the lack of consultation in drawing up the legislation that led to the attempt to overturn the Bushell decision, the government has again indulged in a similar lack of consultation about the compensation program. My office was inundated with letters protesting about this secrecy. Surely the government should allow veterans to go back and consult with their organisations, because naturally veterans are highly suspicious of any moves that are going to affect their access to a disability pension. In the event, their worst fears were unfounded as far as this was concerned, but I would ask why we cannot find a better way to deal with such sensitive measures&mdash;indeed, with measures that will be highly unpopular to the community most affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are pleased that the government has not accepted the harsher recommendations in either of the two reports but, as I said, we do have concerns about the means of dealing with the changes to the payment of income support. We have been approached by a number of veterans groups who are deeply concerned with the measures in this bill which deal with the establishment of statements of principles binding on the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the courts and the AAT have complained that they as lay people should not be asked to make decisions on medical evidence when both sides have expert medical opinion to back them up. This legislation sets up the Repatriation Medical Authority to provide an appropriate forum for the resolution of technical, medical and scientific issues. This forum is meant to ensure consistency of decisions, which has been a problem in the past. The RMA will prepare statements of principles which will be binding on the courts and on the AAT, thus taking away the power of the courts to make decisions on medical evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans will be able to make submissions to the RMA which will be considered in the process of making statements of principles. If they are not satisfied with decisions made on their cases, they can appeal to the Veterans Review Board. However, because the courts will be bound by the statements of principles, the veterans will no longer have access to that appeal process in their individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Veterans can also request the RMA to carry out investigations into the cause of any injury, disease or death, and they can request a review of any statements of principles. Provision exists for the Repatriation Commission to override any of the statements of principles for certain specific categories, but this would be done only on very rare occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the concern expressed to us by many of the veterans groups, the Democrats referred this matter to the community affairs committee, and at the hearing the minister foreshadowed amendments and acknowledged that he had already been approached and that discussions were under way. It has been very much of a rush but we are pleased to see these amendments before us, because they certainly improve the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had a chance to look through these amendments and basically what they do is set up the Specialist Medical Review Council. On those grounds this bill as it stands does at least leave some avenue of appeal, even if that avenue of appeal is not back through the courts process. Basically, what will now happen is that an individual veteran or his or her medical representative can appeal the decision. We certainly will not be opposing these amendments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would still like to point out, however, that we do have deep concerns, that we in this place through this legislation are taking away from veterans a legal right which they previous enjoyed&mdash;that is, the right to appeal to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vietnam veterans have informed me that they intend to challenge the matter in the High Court. We think in view of the fact that it is the courts which have previously complained about making decisions on medical evidence, this is an appropriate course of action and we await the outcome with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make two points in finishing. The first is that a number of veterans have expressed concern that there could be a delay in the consideration of an appeal. The minister's office has assured me that it will be an easy matter to ensure that these delays do not occur, certainly that there are no undue delays in the consideration of appeals. I ask that the minister give an undertaking again tonight that this matter will certainly be addressed should it arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the minister in his second reading speech gave a personal commitment that, if after 12 months this legislation has not achieved its objectives, the scheme will be reviewed. I would like to put on notice here and now that, if this does prove to be the case, the Democrats will be holding the minister to that commitment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains important parts of this year's veterans affairs budget package. It delivers major benefits to the ex-service community and has been developed following extensive consultation with ex-service community leaders. The initiatives respond in part to recommendations of the committee chaired by Peter Baume in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Fair Go</EMPHASIS>, and concerns expressed by the Australian National Audit Office, which the government was bound to address. The remaining initiatives of this budget package that require legislation will be presented in a bill to be introduced at a later date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreement was reached with the national bodies of the major ex-service organisations that the package was to be an all or nothing package. These groups realistically recognised that it was not possible to improve benefits to veterans and their dependants without increased expenditure being offset by savings achieved by ensuring that the benefits are provided to those with a genuine entitlement. Nevertheless, following concerns expressed by certain ex-service leaders, the government has worked closely with both the ex-service community and the opposition, and has agreed to certain amendments that will be moved by the opposition tonight. I will return to those proposed amendments at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are significant changes that will result in greater equity and will more appropriately recognise groups within the ex-service community that until now have not been adequately recognised. The beneficial impact of the initiatives contained in this package has unfortunately been overshadowed by some misinformed debate about the new Repatriation Medical Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable misunderstanding concerning review rights following the introduction of this bill and, as a result, negotiations have taken place as to whether there should be additional review rights to those already contained in the bill. Tonight I want to correct that misunderstanding. I emphasise that the bill does not take away the right of any veteran to apply to the Veterans Review Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to the circumstances of his or her particular claim. Those bodies will still have the duty to determine all the relevant facts and particular circumstances relating to individual veterans' claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only the medical scientific issues of causation of disease and injury that are appropriately left to experts that will be determined by the statements of principles. Accordingly, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> of 8 June 1994 commenting on the bill, did not indicate that it trespassed unduly on personal rights or makes such rights unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions or inappropriately delegated legislative powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I set out on behalf of the government the details of the proposal that has been agreed to. It is proposed to establish a specialist medical review council which will review determinations of the Repatriation Medical Authority in certain circumstances. The review council will be made up of a number of councillors selected from lists of names submitted to the minister by the medical colleges. The convenor of the specialist medical review council would then be appointed by the minister from those lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conducting the review, the review council would be made up of at least three, and not more than five, councillors. The selection of councillors to determine a particular appeal would be based on the fields of specialist medical scientific knowledge relevant to that appeal. The same categories of persons who can make submissions to the repatriation medical authority would be able to make submissions and appear before the specialist medical review council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review council will have the power to conduct reviews in relation to a statement of principles, a declaration that the repatriation medical authority does not intend to make a statement of principles or a decision of the authority not to carry out an investigation in respect of a particular kind of injury, disease or death. In determining the review of such matters, the review council will have the power to issue directions to the repatriation medical authority, the effect of which will be to require the authority to make or amend a statement of principles, or reverse such declaration or decision of the repatriation medical authority, or to affirm such a statement of principles, declaration or decision of the repatriation medical authority and to reconsider the matter in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the review council, including any further investigation that the authority might undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review system will preserve all of the review and appeal mechanisms that are currently in the Veterans' Entitlements Act and in the bill, including the existing right of appeal to the Veterans' Review Board and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions of the Repatriation Commission on all aspects other than the narrow medical scientific aspects that will be dealt with by the statement of principles. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment adds a reference to new subsection 196B(9B) to new paragraph 120A(3)(a) being inserted by clause 9. That new subsection is being added by amendment (13).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 196B(9D) deals with the date of effect of decisions of the Review Council.

Subject to that, section 196D will apply to such determinations, ie, any such determinations will be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Establishment of Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 196U formally establishes the Review Council as a body corporate with perpetual succession, having a common seal, and the capacity to sue and be sued. Courts, judges, tribunals and persons acting judicially must take judicial notice of the seal of the Authority appearing on a document and must presume that the document was duly sealed. The seal is, in effect, the signature of the Review Council. The debts of the Review Council will be taken to be debts of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Functions of Review Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 196V details the functions of the Specialist Medical Review Council. The section deals with two types of request&mdash;under new section 196X or under new section 196Y.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Review Council in respect of requests under new section 196X are dealt with in new subsections 196V(2) to (5). As specified in new subsection 196V(2), these requests under section 196X cover requests to review the contents of a Statement of Principles or to review a decision not to determine a Statement of Principles. For these requests the Review Council must  carry out a review of all of the material that was available to the Repatriation Medical Authority when it last determined, amended, or decided not to issue, a Statement of Principles. Consideration of material that was not available to the Authority is to be reviewed first by the Authority pursuant to a request under new section 196E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because a Statement of Principles is a disallowable instrument, new subsection (3) makes it clear that the Review Council may not carry out such a review until the Statement has successfully reached the end of the period during which it could be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsections (4) and (5) deal with the two possible outcomes of a review by the Review Council. If the Council is of the view that there is sound medical-scientific evidence that was available to the Authority when it made its determination or decision that would justify the Authority in amending or determining a Statement of Principles, then the Council must make a written declaration. That declaration must state the Council's views and set out the supporting evidence and must either direct the Authority to amend or determine a Statement of Principles or otherwise remit the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, if the Council is of the view that there is no sound medical-scientific evidence that was available to the Authority when it made its decision, that would justify making or amending a Statement of Principles, or that the sound medical-scientific evidence that was available to the Authority when it made its decision is insufficient to justify making or amending a Statement of Principles, then the Council must make a written declaration to that effect, giving reasons. The Council may include in the declaration any recommendation that it may wish to make about the future investigation that the Authority may carry out in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Written submissions, appearances and oral submissions are dealt with in new section 196Z. That section is explained in more detail later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Review Council in respect of requests under new section 196Y are dealt with in new subsections 196V(6) to (8). As specified in new subsection 196V(6), these requests under section 196Y cover requests to review a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority under subsection 196C(4) not to carry out an investigation. Subsection 196C(4) allows the Authority to decide not to carry out an investigation if it had investigated that particular kind of injury, disease or death and, within the 12 months after that investigation, determined or amended a Statement of Principles or declared that it did not propose to make or amend a Statement of Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 196V(6) requires the Review Council to consider the reasons given by the Authority for making the decision, the information on which it relied in making that decision, the grounds for the request, and any submission made in support of those grounds. After consideration of those matters, new subsection (7) requires the Council to direct the Authority to carry out an investigation if it is of the view that there appeared to be new sound medical-scientific evidence that had not previously been considered and relied on by the Authority, which, together with the sound medical-scientific evidence available to the Authority when it made its decision, could justify the making or amending of a Statement of Principles. The Council may include in the declaration any recommendation or direction that the Council considers fit to make about the carrying out of the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is not of that view, new subsection (8) requires the Council to make a declaration affirming the decision of the Authority and giving its reasons. It may include in its declaration any recommendation that it considers fit to make about any future investigation that the Authority may carry out in respect of that kind of injury, disease or death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notification of decision of Review Council to be notified in Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 196W provides that the Review Council must notify its decisions in the Gazette and give a copy of the decision to the requester, the Commission (if it was not the requester) and the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Request for review of contents of Statement of Principles etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 196X(1) allows the Repatriation Commission, veterans, their dependants, or organisations representing veterans or their dependants,  to request the Review Council to review the contents of a Statement of Principles or a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to make a Statement of Principles. Subsection (2) requires that such a request must be made within 3 months of either the making or amending of the Statement, or the decision not to make a Statement. New subsection (3) requires such requests to be in a form approved by the Review Council, to state the grounds on which the review is sought and to be lodged with the Department. Under new subsection (4), the Secretary is required to pass a request to the Authority within 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Request for review of decision of Repatriation Medical Authority not to carry out an investigation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 196Y(1) allows the Repatriation Commission, veterans, their dependants, or organisations representing veterans or their dependants, within three months, to request the Review Council to review a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to carry out an investigation which they had requested under new section 196E. Such a refusal to carry out an investigation would be made by the Repatriation Medical Authority under subsection 196C(4) which allows the Authority to decide not to carry out an investigation if it had investigated that particular kind of injury, disease or death and within the 12 months after that investigation had determined or amended a Statement of Principles or declared that it did not propose to make or amend a Statement of Principles. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 196Y(2) requires such requests to be in a form approved by the Review Council, to state the grounds on which the review is sought and to be lodged with the Department together with a supporting submission if desired. Under new subsection (3), the Secretary is required to pass a request to the Authority within 28 days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions to Review Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsections 196Z(1) to (3) cover reviews under new subsection 196V(2) as requested under new subsection 196X.

These subsections specify that any person or organisation who may make a request under new section 196X can make a written submission about any relevant information, that is, information that was available to the Repatriation Medical Authority when it made its decision and that is relevant to the review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to discuss today one of the most important issues facing Australia, which is the future constitution of this country. There seem to be three main arguments put forward by the republicans for a change. The first is to make Australia truly independent, supposedly. I understand that Hugh Stretton, who is a leftist republican supporter, dismisses this and says, for example, that it is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">perhaps because Paul Keating is selling off our real independence that he is directing our attention to the symbolic independence of a republic.</PARA>
<PARA>Does anybody really think Australia is not a totally and entirely independent country? If people do, they only have to look at the findings of the Labor Party's own constitutional committee, which reported in 1985 and said that `Australia has achieved full independence'. If there is any threat at all to our independence it comes not from our monarchy, not from our system of government, but from the Labor Party's moves to allow the United Nations and its subcommittees&mdash;many of those committees being populated by dictators and communist autocrats&mdash;to intervene in our own internal affairs. That is the only real threat to our independence at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reverse of course is true. In many republics individuals lose their independence under a presidency where there are no brakes on the power of the executive. Individual independence is our real independence. It should always be striven for above less meaningful and less tangible national independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second argument seems to be that the head of the nation is never an Australian citizen. The Prime Minister is of course always an Australian citizen. This is the highest elected office in the land and this is the position with the greatest capacity for making its mark upon Australian society. The monarch is not in a position of power and indeed should not be. The monarch is in a position of imposing brakes on otherwise unfettered power. No-one, except for Australia's elected representatives, should have the power to create legislation and policy. The Queen never represents Australia overseas. The head of state in Australia is the guardian of the constitution, and this position at home and overseas is undertaken by the Governor-General, who nowadays is always an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third argument is that the royal family is badly behaved and not fit to rule. Some of the controversial personal affairs of the current members of the royal family are sometimes quoted as an example of this. It is true that there have been exemplary monarchs, and it is true that there have been those who have been less than exemplary. Edward II consistently upset his English subjects by cavorting publicly with his boyfriend and was eventually put to death in a singularly unpleasant way. But the monarchy survived. Charles I was beheaded&mdash;the monarchy survived. As far as the damage caused by royal separation and divorces is concerned, we only have to look at Henry VIII and his marital woes. In that situation divorce was the preferred alternative for his hapless wives, since the alternative of course was beheading. But the monarchy survived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like all humans, royals come in all shapes and sizes, capable of great good and great evil and of setting fine examples and of setting excessive examples and extravagances. The royals have spawned scholars and lunatics, rulers and renegades, and the same would be true of a president&mdash;the head of a republic in Australia. The essential point is that we have a monarchy which has hundreds of years of history behind it. It offers something no temporary political president can offer&mdash;long-term stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presidents can be compassionate. They can be dictatorial, dangerous, ignorant, ruthless, competent or corrupt. Just think of Idi Amin, Hitler and Ferdinand Marcos. They cannot be prevented but their ultimate power can be constrained by a constitutional monarchy such as we have. Their totalitarianism would be difficult to achieve under a constitutional monarchy such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our present system caters for human weakness and frailty. Republics by and large do not, and republics are inherently less stable. Look at the five republics that France has had. Which of those options would our republican colleagues choose? Look at the 40 to 50 prime ministers in Italy since the war. There is no stability in the political system in Italy. Italy is a wonderful country in spite of its political system, not because of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All power in Australia is watered down by a system of brakes and checks, including this chamber&mdash;the Senate&mdash;a tiered system of government, the monarchy and its representatives. Forcing a republic would endanger all this. Our safety mechanism, which has been long used and proven, would be dismantled or at least fragmented even with the adoption of the so-called minimalist position. Only 39 words of our constitution have been changed in almost 100 years. The minimalist position of the republicans by itself would require at least 2,000 words to be changed. There would need, therefore, to be a profoundly compelling argument to persuade Australians to cast aside a unique system of democracy which has served us so well for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pro-republican activists are not a coherent group. They have no uniform ideas of how to implement a republic. The reason for that is simple: there is no workable suggestion that is acceptable to the Australian people. This is why they resort to emotive rhetoric rather than coherent debate&mdash;the lickspittles, forelock tuggers type of approach. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want an appointed president beholden to political considerations over which we have no control. We do not want an elected president who would be beholden to those who funded his or her rise and whose longevity as a president would be dependent upon his or her popularity. The head of state must be completely non-political. The head of a republic might, for example, be appointed by a prime minister, elected by the parliament or elected by popular vote. All of these result in a political head of state, and we cannot and should not accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no substitute for a non-elected, non-popular, non-political head of state with limited powers. Australians will not be sold a pup. We will not embrace change just for the sake of change. We know that freedom and independence is ultimately for the individual. That, indeed, is the very essence of the Liberal Party philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A nation's character is built by the individuals within it and it is protected by the constitution that it built. Thus far, it has served us very well. We are constitutionalists rather than monarchists, in the sense that we are first and foremost the defenders of our constitution and of our political way of life and only as such are defenders of the monarchy because the monarchy is intrinsic to our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the strongest arguments for the monarchy is that the alternatives are so appalling. A powerful president involved in policy decisions could withdraw power from the currently elected representatives. It is likely that such a president would be a failed politician, probably from the Labor Party, who was kicked upstairs simply to get him or her out of the way, or as a reward for treading the party line. </PARA>
<PARA>The republicans fail to answer three vital questions. One is why we need a republic, and I have addressed that; secondly, who is insisting upon change; and thirdly, how would we be better off?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who wants this change? I simply make the point that, according to the polls, half of Australia does not want the change. Therefore, at best this issue will split the nation in two. The republicans can never answer the third simple question as to who would be better off. Bob Hawke gave the answer in 1985 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The well-being of ordinary Australians would not be changed one iota if we became a republic.</PARA>
<PARA>I seem to be agreeing more and more with Bob Hawke over the past few days. He was supportive of the findings of the constitutional committee appointed by the Hawke Labor government in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee said three things. It said first that Australia has achieved full independence. The second point it made was that the British government has no responsibility in relation to matters that are the responsibility of the federal government and the parliament. Thirdly, that committee said that the development of Australian nationhood does not require any change to the Australian constitution. Remember that this was a Labor-appointed constitutional committee. But of course this does not stop Mr Keating rewriting Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the most divisive issue in Australia today. Paul Keating has a reputation, thoroughly deserved, as the most divisive Prime Minister this country has ever had. He is tearing us apart over something that does not need to be fixed. He has already set Australian against Australian over so many issues. We need a healing leader, not a destructive one. There are many more urgent problems than this facing Australia. It is vitally important that we do not allow our community to be torn asunder when the end result is that the country would not be better off in any way at all as a result of a switch to a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all believe that our country is the most independent, most freedom loving country in the world. This is due in no small part to our system of government, which is the envy of</PARA>

Indeed, the freest and most tolerant societies in the world tend to be constitutional monarchies, including countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom. Thousands of people have come to live in Australia because of our freedom, our independence and our stability, which are due in no small part to our system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous legal problems. The very best legal brains&mdash;people like Harry Gibbs and Michael Kirby&mdash;tell us that the legal problems and difficulties are almost insurmountable. This is confirmed by the report of the Turnbull committee which filled 600 pages and cost $500,000. Our Australian system of government is uniquely Australian.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most Victorian senators and members will be aware of the Mount Macedon memorial cross. Over the years many Victorians would have been taken as children to visit the cross. As the years have gone by they have returned with their own sons and daughters. I certainly recall being taken there as a young child. Later my parents moved to Mount Macedon and my mother, Betty Kemp, whose father had served in Gallipoli and France, had a special affection for the cross. She would often be seen with other members of the Mount Macedon community collecting funds to help maintain the cross. The cross commemorates the service men and women of World War I and the memorial gates going to the cross commemorate the service men and women of World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The monument was opened in 1935 by the then Premier of Victoria, Sir Stanley Argyle. The cross owes a great deal to the generosity and enthusiasm of a Mr William Cameron. He spent large sums of money building the cross and its surrounds. The cross is a major tourist attraction in Victoria. About a quarter of a million visitors come to the reserve each year. Once the area is fully restored, the number of visitors could easily double. Standing at the cross, one can view the surrounding plains as far as Port Phillip Bay. On the way to the cross, the Major Mitchell lookout provides superb views to the west, to the wombat forest and the surrounding foothills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 60 years on, it is not surprising that the often harsh environment at the summit of Mt Macedon has taken its toll on the steel and cement structure of the cross. The cross itself was damaged in 1975 by a lightning strike. The Ash Wednesday fires of 16 February 1983 further damaged the memorial cross reserve. The fire on 16 February drastically altered the landscape and the standing dead trees surrounding the cross are a stark reminder of that day. The greatest damage has been from water seepage causing extensive corrosion to the structure. Regrettably, safety considerations have meant that it is no longer possible for visitors to stand at the foot of the cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report on the condition of the cross was commissioned in 1991. It concluded that if nothing was done to repair the steel framework corrosion would continue, resulting in eventual failure and collapse of the cross with consequent serious safety risks to the public. It has now been decided to totally replace the cross, involving fabrication of a precast high-tech concrete structure of the same dimensions as the existing cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to record that a public appeal has been launched to raise up to $1 million to restore this important war memorial. The Victorian minister for conservation, Mr Mark Birrell, has announced the establishment of a trust chaired by Dr Moulds to manage the appeal and raise the funds. I am delighted to see that Mr Bruce Ruxton is a member of the trust, as are friends of my family: Mrs Harbison, Brigadier Ian Gilmore and Air Vice-Marshal Carter.

I hope that the Commonwealth government may see its way to making a direct grant to support the project. I have written to the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca; the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker; and the Minister for Tourism, Mr Lee. The total restoration work for the cross and surrounds, as I have mentioned, will total about a million dollars and I hope that the Commonwealth may be able to see its way clear to making a contribution in the order of $100,000. </PARA>

For those in the bureaucracy, and for those in the Labor party who believe that anyone living on the land is a rich squatter with inherited wealth and a stash of money, let me tell them that half of the membership of the ICPA is made up of parents who are shearers, farmhands, itinerant workers and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group is not rich; thus it is not powerful and it is not strong. The group cannot afford a professional lobbyist. Those who come to Canberra are the ones who can afford to get here. They do not fly first class and they do not stay in four star hotels. They represent kids who really are the disadvantaged in society. As the ICPA president, David Houston said today, `Between geography and the assets test, our kids miss out on everything'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago I made a three day visit to western New South Wales to talk with landholders about land care and other issues. One of those `other issues' was the difficulties under which families raise and educate their children. I talked with people from the Tibooburra Outback School of the Air; with the teachers who had left places like Queanbeyan and gone to Tibooburra with its 18 kids in school and 25 others `on the air' because they believe that that is where the real teaching and the real kids are. They are teachers who, despite the harsh conditions, really believe in what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked with the children's helpers&mdash;the people who live on outback properties and help the children with their schooling both on air and at home. They are paid a pathetic amount; probably the dole would be a more profitable option. The helpers cannot be paid any more because there is not any money in western New South Wales to pay them. Landholders out there run sheep, and for those who do not know it, the wool market collapsed some years ago but the cost of running and shearing sheep has not got any cheaper; nor has rabbit and woody weed control, shire rates, diesel, food and everything else that goes to constitute a living in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ICPA raised a number of issues today, but there is one that I want to particularly highlight tonight. Under the assistance for isolated children scheme, the AIC, parents of children in outback areas receive a home tutor allowance of $10 a week for primary children and $20 a week for secondary students. When I visited western New South Wales I spoke with parents who receive a lousy $10 a week for teaching their primary children at home and $20 a week if they have their secondary aged children still at home. They teach their children in between doing the books for the farm, acting as a stockhand outside the house, running a house where the local store is many hours away, and fitting in the other normal social activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this the International Year of the Family I contend that the AIC is one of the most blatant anti-family measures currently on offer from the federal government. It is anti-family because it provides that tutors at home can receive $10 a week for each child, but if the parent&mdash;usually the mother&mdash;moves into town and sets up a second home, in effect breaking up the family, the family can receive $2,500 per child per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in western New South Wales is that families that have taken that option because they cannot afford to send their children to Adelaide&mdash;the closest capital city where their children can board&mdash;either break up permanently, or the father decides that trying to run a property on his own with no family to come home to at night simply is not worth it, the farm is sold up and another statistic is added to the job queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me that is so blatantly unfair that when I was first acquainted with it I could not believe it was happening and I did not know why the government was doing it to real Australians&mdash;people who are the salt of the earth. I am told by the ICPA that the number of affected children is around 9,000. It would hardly be financially crippling if the government were to offer every isolated child a living away from home allowance. After all, in theory it is already available. If every child were to be moved into town the total cost per year would be around $22 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are spending billions of dollars on social security and millions of dollars on city based child care for two income non-means tested urban families, but nothing for rural families&mdash;we have allocated $2.2 million in this year's budget for writing a national agenda for families, but refuse funding for 9,000 children in isolated areas of Australia&mdash;the inequity is as blatant as it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party talks of government funding that is equitable and needs based, but that same government provides $23 million to outfit the department of foreign affairs offices in New York and Canberra. The Labor government produced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a fairer Australia: Social justice strategy</EMPHASIS> paper, saying it was committed to ensuring that its policies and programs enabled women to live with economic security and independence, freedom from discrimination, and equality of opportunity. But it pays them $10 a week to educate their children. Where is the fairness and equity in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ICPA has a valid point. The biggest difficulty is one of perception. These people living on the land are regarded by too many in the bureaucracy and on the government benches as the established wealthy&mdash;the landholders who measure their properties by kilometres, not hectares. It may be true that their properties are large, but these days they run more rabbits than sheep and they measure their properties by the size of their debt. They are all in debt&mdash;some irretrievably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The isolated children of Australia need our help. It is important that we provide it. This is an issue that I do not intend to give up on because the inequity of it is so massive that it demands our attention. It is no coincidence that the 14 poorest electorates in Australia are rural electorates, and the three poorest are held by the National Party. Neither is it a coincidence that the third richest is Canberra&mdash;a Labor town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to seriously re-examine the traditional bias in Australia against the people on the land. In Australia we need to appreciate where the needs are greatest. I suggest that western New South Wales and the other outback and remote areas of Australia are a good place to start. But it is not only the landholders; the workers in that area also have a real need. They are all real people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a serious matter about justice and democracy in Queensland. In the past in the Senate I have raised the matter of the Whitsunday Shire Council, based in Proserpine on the Whitsunday Coast in central North Queensland. At the shire council elections on 26 March this year the former chairman and the former deputy chairman of the council, both of whom in every previous election had topped the poll, were defeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is never possible to say with any certainty why political candidates are defeated, I think it is fairly well recognised in the Whitsunday shire area that one of the reasons that the mayor and the deputy mayor suffered electorally was a high profile dispute between the then elected council and its shire clerk. There were, of course, other reasons, including a campaign of smear and innuendo, which I understand will be the subject of court cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dispute between the council and its clerk arose when the council attempted to dismiss the shire clerk for the following failures, according to affidavits filed in the Supreme Court: failure to obey council directives; an uncooperative and unhelpful attitude; low level of general competence; lack of knowledge of the Local Government Act; alienation of other executive staff; emotional instability; breakdown of relationships with the council; being drunk at an official function; insubordination; and failure to report to the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further affidavits filed in the Supreme Court in various legal actions also related vicious and unprovoked insults by the clerk to various members of the community, including senior ratepayers; a claim that whilst representing the council in a social capacity she had drunk to excess in the presence of many ratepayers and developers; an allegation that she had made overt and unwanted sexual advances to a number of residents of the shire and, by her inappropriate contact, had made it more difficult for a number of ratepayers to deal with the council in an effective and business-like way; and allegations of the clerk's volatile, erratic and unprofessional behaviour in the presence of council residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the council received legal advice that there were sufficient reasons for the termination of the shire clerk's employment. Evidence to support the allegations of the clerk's unsuitable behaviour were contained in affidavits filed in the Supreme Court. I am informed that the council actually sacked the clerk on 12 July 1993 but three days later the Queensland government reinstated the clerk, declaring her to be a whistleblower, suggesting that because she had reported members of the council to the CJC she was sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CJC was at the time making an inquiry into allegations that the chairman had a pecuniary interest in a quarry which competed with a quarry owned by the council. The CJC, however, was not involved because of a whistleblower report by the shire clerk. The CJC had in fact become involved at the request of the council itself in 1991 after pressure by the chairman himself for the CJC to investigate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, only a matter of days before the local authority election and during the campaign, the CJC issued a report exonerating the chairman from any wrongdoing in relation to the quarry. During the conduct of the CJC inquiry, which dragged on over a couple of years prior to the 1994 elections, the CJC required that no information be made public by the council as to the reasons for the clerk's dismissal. The chairman, deputy chairman and other members of the council had honoured this requirement that no public statement be made regarding reasons for the clerk's dismissal and, as a result, in the nine months leading up to the election it was generally believed by the people of Whitsunday&mdash;a belief reinforced because it was uncontested&mdash;that the shire clerk had been dismissed because she was a whistleblower in relation to a CJC matter. This impression was encouraged by the Labor member for Whitsunday, Mrs Lorraine Bird who, as I will mention later, has a rather unsavoury part in this whole affair. But I return to the dismissal of the clerk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, on 12 July 1993 the council sacked the clerk but she was reinstated three days later by the Queensland government. Legal proceedings were instituted by the council and on 8 February 1994, just six weeks before the election, Mr Justice Demack of the Queensland Supreme Court handed down a judgment in which he said that the reasons for the dismissal of the clerk should be given in open court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CJC immediately lodged appeals on this and a related decision which the council hoped to have heard in late February. But for whatever reason, the court postponed the hearing of the appeals until late April or May, thus denying the voters of the Whitsunday Shire the right to hear the council's reasons for the dismissal of the shire clerk before the elections. The council by resolution requested that the Queensland government defer the shire council elections until reasons could be made public. Naturally enough, being directed to a Labor government, the request was not acceded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the clerk's sacking had nothing to do with the CJC inquiry but solely regarded her incompetency and unsuitability for the job. The Labor member for Whitsunday, Mrs Lorraine Bird, had used parliamentary privilege and her position on the Queensland Parliamentary Criminal Justice Committee to dishonestly defame and implicate the former chairman of the Whitsunday Shire Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, on 20 April 1994 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> reported that Mrs Bird had abused her position of trust on the parliamentary committee overseeing the CJC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me, I say that Mr Cleeland did not construct his attack upon the AFL commission and its executive director, Mr Ross Oakley, with a great deal of wit or with any decency. Of course, it was incorrect all the way through, yet Senator Faulkner, in answering a question in question time today, chose in effect to support Mr Cleeland and not intervene in his capacity as minister to quell this most important argument that is brewing in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Faulkner thinks he has no responsibility in this matter, then he is sadly mistaken. As minister responsible for sport in this country, he seems to be neglecting the sporting and cultural significance of the AFL in Australia. I point out to Senator Faulkner and, indeed, Mr Cleeland the utter irresponsibility of one particular comment. Mr Cleeland took a very cheap shot at Mr Ross Oakley, the executive director of the AFL. Mr Cleeland said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak concerning the Australian Football League and its current management.

Mr Oakley has brought to Australian rules football the same sorts of management practices.</PARA>
<PARA>No-one can be left in any doubt as to what Mr Cleeland was suggesting&mdash;that this very high profile issue at the moment dealing with Mr Elliott can be equated to the AFL and the management practices of Mr Oakley. From the chairman of the NCA committee, that is irresponsible&mdash;and that is putting it lightly. The chairman of the NCA committee&mdash;the very organisation that has inquired into Mr Elliott's and Mr Jarrett's affairs&mdash;Mr Cleeland, has decided that he will use his most important position to align that sort of behaviour with the AFL and Mr Oakley. It is irresponsible, it is not worthy of a chairman and it is not worthy indeed of Mr Cleeland. I am surprised to think Mr Cleeland would place himself in such an irresponsible position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) It is understood that the Forth community has established a self-help rebroadcasting facility which has enabled delivery of ABC and TNT television services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The extension of further transmission facilities for  ABC TV is based on considerations of population, cost, topography and availability of spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing programs ABC TV has been made available terrestrially to an estimated 98 percent of the population. The National Transmission Agency, which is responsible for the operation and maintenance of national transmission facilities, proposes to provide a translator to enable ABC transmissions from Mt Barrow on Channel 32 to be re-transmitted to the Forth area, which should ensure continued access to ABC TV with improved reception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) has advised that communities at Acton Road, Mole Creek and Maydena in Tasmania have transmitters licensed under the Radiocommunications Act 1992 for re-transmission purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) &amp; (6) Under the current Equalisation Implementation Plans, Forth is not to receive direct broadcasts from either commercial service. The Forth area is characterised by a deep valley surrounded by rugged terrain, requiring installation of dedicated retransmission facilities to provide residents with television signals. The town's small population (around 300) is unlikely to make installation of these facilities attractive to commercial operators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has agreed to allocate to a subsidiary of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) a two service satellite subscription television licence (Licence C). The services are to be operated on a commercial basis separate from ABC free-to-air services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has advised that current plans for the location of the Licence C subsidiary operation have followed from the establishment of the broadcast facilities for the A and B satellite subscription television licensees in Sydney. As it is envisaged that the Licence C signal will be uplinked from the same uplinking point as the other licensees' services, it is necessary for the site of distribution to be coordinated from Sydney. Furthermore, the central vision, text library and network management centre of the ABC is based in Sydney and the most efficient commercially appropriate solution for delivery of the new subscription television services requires co-siting with that resources infrastructure. Given the ABC Board's requirement as to financial and operational viability for the new subscription television services, the use of the Gore Hill headquarters site is the only solution available in the establishment of those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has determined, in light of these factors, that Sydney-based management is likely to be the most efficient and effective arrangement for the subscription television subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has indicated that the Licence C services are expected to draw heavily on back catalogue programming already produced by the ABC in all of its production centres and that the News Channel will draw on journalistic resources across Australia with a firm focus on each capital city and the national Parliament.</PARA>
