<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, representing the Prime Minister. No doubt the minister heard this morning the comments of the highly respected business leader, John Prescott, Managing Director of BHP, when he said that real interest rates in Australia are `unrealistically high'; that `they're out of line with the fundamentals'; that, despite low inflation, `we have amongst the highest money interest rates in the world'; and that interest rates in Australia have gone up three times the rate of those in the United States, without explanation from this government. I ask the minister: does this not further demonstrate how out of touch his government is with business reality when he describes, as he did a little while ago, the decision to push up interest rates as `sensible and prudential'? Does it not further demonstrate that the minister simply does not understand that what he is contributing to is a repeat of the boom-bust record which led to such devastation in the early 1990s?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill is making clear his inability to understand what Mr Prescott was talking about this morning. He said that we were seeing a broadly based recovery and that the government's projection of 14 per cent to 15 per cent growth in investment was realistic, and generally speaking his remarks were extremely supportive of the government's position and economic strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he said about real interest rates was clearly directed to the long end of the interest rate market; he was talking about movements in longer term interest rates, such as our 10-year bonds, because of the reference in the same sentence to increases two or three times greater than those in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Short interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could not have been talking about the short end of the market, Senator Short, because at the short end of the market&mdash;I will give Senator Short the figures&mdash;US rates have risen by 1 3/4 percentage points, while Australia's have risen by only three-quarters of a percentage point. We have had substantially less than half the increase in the United States at the short end of the market. The situation is that real short term interest rates are currently around 4.3 per cent, which is historically very low indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that the longer term rates have been increasing. US 10-year bond yields have increased by around 1.6 percentage points from their February average, while Australia's long yields have increased by around 3 1/2 percentage points. Increase in Australian yields have not been treble but in fact double those in the US. They are running at about 8.2 per cent, and that is historically high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about the longer term rates is that they are determined by the markets, and the government shares Mr Prescott's difficulty in understanding why in the hell the markets have reacted as they have done so far at the long end of the market, because the truth is that the Australian economy is currently enjoying the best set of economic fundamentals for three decades, with inflation at extremely low levels, accompanied by very positive economic growth and particularly, of course, employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the Australian economy is universally acknowledged to be in just about the best shape it has been for the last three decades. Under those circumstances, it is manifestly irrational for the bond markets to have been as spooked as they apparently have been by some of those overseas developments which have led them to react in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the short term rates, which are the immediate representative of the government's position and the response to the government's position, are at the levels which I have described. Senator Hill has once again demonstrated that he could not make an impression on a soft cushion in this place or any other place he might choose to go to.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The government continues to blame the markets rather than accept responsibility, and the minister continues to confuse the long end of the market with money rates. Mr Prescott was talking about money rates. Look at bank prime interest rates. Is it not in fact the case that Australian prime interest rates are higher than those of Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, and three times that of Japan and the United States? Is that not in fact what Mr Prescott was talking about? How does the government expect Australian business to compete under its policies when business has to accept real interest rates higher than those of the rest of the world?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let Mr Prescott speak for himself:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think interest rates in Australia in real terms are unrealistically high. They are out of line with the fundamentals. We still have very low inflation but we have amongst the highest money interest rates in the world. Our interest rates have gone up three times the increases in the US for reasons that have not been explained.</PARA>
<PARA>He is obviously talking about that, otherwise his reference to the United States would have made no sense at all. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the Reserve Bank is about to put them up again?</PARA>
<PARA>And Mr Prescott went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I know there is speculation about that but we would see that as being at loggerheads with the fundamentals.</PARA>
<PARA>The reference to the `fundamentals' is one of total confidence in the fundamentals of the Australian economy as they exist at the moment, and of total confidence in what the government has done to produce those fundamentals being as effectively in place as they are.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Today the Prime Minister released the government's cultural policy statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creative Nation</EMPHASIS>, in which he announced a significant number of very important initiatives across Australia's cultural landscape. Can the minister, particularly in his capacity as Minister for Trade, explain how these initiatives will create the opportunities to enhance Australia's export performance and project a new, vibrant image abroad?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1866" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her very creative question. It is in fact a privilege to have had the chance to be even slightly involved in the development of this very important statement. I think Australians will immediately and over time come to recognise and appreciate the significance of this statement in Australian cultural history. It seeks to enhance our capacity as Australians and as a nation to access, preserve and protect our cultural heritage; to encourage and facilitate new artistic works; and to maximise community participation in our cultural life. This comprehensive and important statement builds on a sound record that was reflected particularly in the 1993 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make particular reference, in direct response to Senator West's question, to the economic aspect of the statement. One part of this very important cultural statement is the overdue proper recognition of the importance of arts and culture as an industry in Australia, an industry which is providing more than 300,000 jobs. It is also an industry with a significant export potential. In fact, it is an industry that adds value to many other areas of activity through design, innovation and marketing. The sincere commitment of the opposition to it was reflected at the last election and appreciated by the people in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Culture is also a valuable export in itself, and there is great potential for that to be added to. The international market for cultural industries is large and growing, and we can share in that increase. In this statement there are many initiatives which build on those things which we did in the 1993 budget in respect of plugging the arts industries into our industry support programs and providing explicit export assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are building on that with new technology initiatives to give Australian industry the capacity to participate in the new international opportunities on the superhighway. Of course, with the film and television fund we are building on the recent tremendous success of our film industry and our television industry. There is a growing capacity for these industries to sell in our region and around the world. As the number and diversity of television channels in our region grow, so the demand for television products will expand. The capacity of Australians to meet that demand is strong and will be substantially reinforced by the strength of the TV production fund and the SBS fund, which have been developed in this statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that we have provided additional funding for the Australia Council to develop an international marketing strategy to increase export potential. It is doing well already. This morning I had the opportunity to open the performing arts market. The market is being developed by the Performing Arts Board of the Australia Council and is being conducted in conjunction with the National Festival of Australian Theatre here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been very successful and is a basis on which we can build. That is why there is extra funding for an international market strategy for the Australia Council, and that will coincide with a market development and international cultural projection strategy within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the recent promotion in Indonesia, and others previously in Korea and Japan, have shown the export potential as well as the cultural benefit of major promotions integrating our business and trade development with the best of Australian culture. There is more funding in this program to develop the opportunity for the best that Australian arts have to offer to project themselves internationally and to reinforce our export performance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it has obviously taken Senator Newman six or eight months to catch up with the news because it was in the newspapers six or eight months ago. The government was faced with the choice of a purchase of a new, second-hand or leased aircraft, or the much cheaper option of bringing the 707 up to a capability in which it could continue in service in the particular role that that plane has played for many years in the past and could play for many years in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these days the 707, as an international aircraft, is not capable of landing at many international airports because of the noise problem for a start, and that has been true for many years. I was only just reading in Senator Button's recently released book about his `voyage' to the funeral of Chernenko in 1984, where he had to fly into a US base in Japan because no commercial airport would take the 707. So we made a decision that, rather than go for the option of a modified 747&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I was explaining the background to the decision to upgrade one 707. The ignoramuses over there decided to interrupt me but I will continue with my answer to Senator Newman's questions. The decision was made that the cheapest possible option in those circumstances was to upgrade one of the 707s, obviously the one that was not an air-to-air refueller. That decision was carried in the newspapers six or eight months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for reminding me for the eighth time. It will be carried out of the defence budget as part of the expenditure. It is also a plane that is used for defence purposes and defence roles on occasions. What I am arguing, quite clearly, Mr President, is that this was by far the cheapest option available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what Senator Newman expects. It is not the done thing for Prime Ministers and others to travel on commercial airlines. Let me tell Senator Newman that that is not enjoyed by commercial airlines because of the security problems it creates for them. As a country, we should provide a reasonable standard of transport for the Governor-General or the Prime Minister when they travel overseas. When I meet many of the visiting dignitaries, I look at some of the planes in which they arrive in this country and I find it quite clear that those planes are far more expensive to purchase and maintain than our well over 20-year-old 707s.</PARA>

However, I remind the minister that the purpose of these 707s is primarily as a troop transport and they must be readily convertible to such for an emergency. So I asked the minister just what this would do to our defence capability&mdash;and he failed to answer that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the sentiments expressed by my colleague Senator McMullan in his answer on the question of the cultural statement&mdash;a very important statement for all Australians&mdash;brought down by the government today. In that statement, the government set aside an amount of $84 million in a package of five specific measures to speed the growth of the Australian multimedia industry. Multimedia products and services are possible because of advances in technology, particularly the development of digital technology, and they are forming the basis of a new era of international service industries that are knowledge intensive. Australia, therefore, is ideally placed to capture part of this market&mdash;the government is determined to see that we do so&mdash;and seize the opportunities presented by this technology, both in cultural and in industry terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key initiative announced by the Prime Minister today is the establishment of Australia Multimedia Enterprise, a $45 million fund to develop and commercialise multimedia products and services. The objectives of the enterprise will be to help finance the development of a multimedia industry in Australia and accelerate the production of Australian content multimedia titles. The enterprise will provide finance on a project basis to develop and commercialise multimedia titles in combination with private sector capital. Australia Multimedia Enterprise will increase direct investment into this area and also encourage private sector investment in the area as well. The fund will be driven by industry and will encourage the forming of consortia to produce and distribute high quality, interactive multimedia products and services. The fund will be supported by developers and is committed to adopting world's best practice as its standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the government has also committed $20.3 million over four years to see the development of up to six cooperative multimedia development centres to increase the skills base for this industry. The centres will be collaborative enterprises between the education and training sectors and other public and private sector organisations. An additional $7.6 million will be provided over the next two years to fund the production of Australia on CD, a program and showcase setting out the wide range of Australia's cultural endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also provide specific assistance to the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Film Television and Radio School and the Australian Children's Television Foundation to encourage the development of their abilities in the multimedia field and to help capture for them and for Australia a large part of the work that will go on the information superhighway.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can. I did meet with a group of representatives from the major primary producer organisations in Australia at the NFF meeting which was convened this morning and, indeed, is still in progress now. I had to tear myself away from it to come back to the delights of question time in the Senate, without which my life would not be complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All major primary producer organisations were represented at this extremely important meeting, and I emphasised at the beginning of the meeting this morning that, while the impending grain situation is serious, there is no reason for panic. I tabled an information paper at the outset of the meeting, and I was pleased that there was broad agreement at the meeting from all of the representatives there with the advice contained in the paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current indications are that existing stocks of wheat, barley and sorghum are sufficient, with a 660,000 tonne safety margin to meet domestic demand until early December, when they will be supplemented by the new season's harvest and importation of grain. The amount of imports necessary will depend critically on the size of the winter crop harvest and the success of the summer sorghum crop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, AQIS has received applications for the importation of just over half a million tonnes of grain. All of these figures are contained in the information paper. There will be a need, depending on the winter crop harvest and the summer sorghum crop, to import between half a million and up to two million tonnes of grain. That latter figure of two million tonnes, I might say, is based on a zero sorghum harvest, which, I stress, is highly unlikely to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have a much better idea of the expected harvest when ABARE releases its accelerated crop report, which is now going to be released on 25 October. AQIS has so far received,  as I have said, applications for the importation of over half a million tonnes of grain. There was broad agreement at the meeting with the information in the paper that our transport system, particularly our ports, will be able to handle transhipments or imports at this level if it is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major issue which is being discussed now is the AQIS protocols required for the importation of grain. Protocols have already been developed and approval given for the importation of 120,000 tonnes of sorghum, 50,000 tonnes of processed meals for stock feed and 10,000 tonnes of maize for pet food. I informed the meeting this morning that I have established an imported grain task force within the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to speed up the AQIS approval process. It will consist of technical staff and plant scientists who will work full time on assessing applications to import grain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If necessary, technical experts will be provided overseas to obtain the latest scientific information to assist in the decision making process. The task force will work to protect Australia's rural industries through the development of safe importing procedures, and the integrity of the assessment process will not be jeopardised. Because of the agreement, certainly in terms of supply and demand that was reached this morning on the basic information contained in the paper I presented this morning and because there are a number of senators who I think would find the detailed information useful, I seek leave of the Senate to have the document incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, second-rate is a positive compliment. Indeed, it is a third or fourth rate contribution from Senator Alston.

As to the specific points on copyright that Senator Alston raises, I will refer those to the Prime Minister or the relevant minister for a detailed reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the point Senator Alston made about the major organisations board, he comprehensively misses the point. The point is that the government is not in the business of itself determining who is getting what amount of funding from what particular pools. It is a matter for arms-length determination and recommendation and advice by the Australia Council. It has not been determined who is in it yet. That is a matter for determination in the first instance by the Australia Council, as I understand it. The government does not want to be put in the position of varying from the arms-length policy that we have adopted towards all grants to relevant organisations.</PARA>

Perhaps he would like to tell us why ordinary Australians should not be outraged at the way in which he has gone about ratting on pre-election promises, particularly the cultural foundation which, he solemnly promised, would be set up quite separate and apart from the Australia Council and would be located in Melbourne. Now we are told it is going to be subsumed within the Australia Council. The government was committed to spend $27 million to locate the National Museum at Yarramundi Reach. Once again it has comprehensively ratted on the Australian people. It is now proposing a pale imitation. It will retain Aboriginal cultural artefacts only, and even then only because Langmore shamed the minister into it in caucus.

It is the case that the National Museum will have a continuing role and status, not only through the proposed new Gallery of Aboriginal Art, which is to be established with a home of its own on the Acton Peninsula here in Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unhappily, it is the case that the Bougainville peace conference adjourned last Friday, 14 October, at Arawa without any progress being made. It did, in that sense, break down. The chairman, Sir George Lepping, has now returned to the Solomon Islands. I understand that the delegates, who gathered in their hundreds from all parts of Bougainville for the talks, have for the most part gone home. So the hope that the peace conference would mark a decisive step towards  a  peaceful settlement  of  the Bougainville conflict has clearly not been realised. That is a matter of profound disappointment to all those, not least Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, who devoted enormous personal energy, time and commitment to the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refusal of the BRA leadership to participate in the conference and their reassertion of hardline demands, including their reported statement that, if total independence is not granted, blood will continue to be shed, suggests that they at least are unprepared to make the compromises that are obviously necessary for a peaceful settlement. We in Australia again appeal to all parties to pursue the process of negotiation and reconciliation. The need for peace on Bougainville is as pressing as ever. The genuine efforts of the majority of parties on Bougainville, supported by regional countries through the regional peacekeeping force, deserved a better outcome than this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the conference has concluded, I understand that large numbers of people from the surrounding areas who met at Arawa yesterday expressed opposition to the hardline stand of BRA leaders Ona, Kabui and Kauona, and that efforts to continue a dialogue between the government and more moderate elements of the BRA may be continuing. Expression of such sentiments in what is effectively the BRA heartland is of some significance. If such a dialogue can be maintained, it may yet offer some progress towards peace, even if the main chance has for the moment been missed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Pacific peacekeeping force has performed outstandingly and won the respect and trust of all parties. It did everything expected of it in securing the conference site, establishing neutral zones and providing security for those wishing to attend the conference. With the effective conclusion of the conference and of its task, the SPPKF is now making preparations for its withdrawal from Bougainville and expects to be off the island by Wednesday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That force represents an unprecedented exercise in South Pacific regional cooperation. I believe we should be proud of the part that our personnel, along with of course those from Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and New Zealand, have played in it. While the command on the ground was exercised by Fiji and Tonga and personnel from those two countries and Vanuatu made up the force itself, the force could not have done the job asked of it without Australia's overall coordination and logistic capabilities, which no other contributor was in a position to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate outlook on Bougainville is very clouded, but the desire of the overwhelming majority of Bougainvilleans for an end to the fighting has, I think, already been forcefully demonstrated at the conference. We appeal to all parties to respect this through maintenance of the cease-fire. We in Australia remain ready to consider any further requests that might be made for assistance in the search for peace on Bougainville. But again I make the point that I have made over and over again from the outset, and that is that the process can be carried forward only through decisions taken by the various groups on Bougainville itself.</PARA>

I think I pointed out on that occasion that the major criticism of the Auditor-General was the amount of money paid up-front. Of course, the alternate bidder required a further $300 million up-front.

During question time today, I indicated that I had some more information to provide to the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate not just the answer from the relevant minister, but also the advice that Senator Spindler sought for tabling yesterday, with excisions to ensure that no operational activities are compromised by the publication of that advice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to respond to matters raised by Senator Spindler, on 17 October, in relation to the AFP investigation into alleged illegal telephone monitoring by Telecom and advice provided by the DPP that search warrants would not issue against Telecom as it was protected by shield of the Crown immunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can inform the Senate that the Attorney-General's Department advises the Minister for Justice that it does not agree with the conclusion, reached by the DPP on 4 March 1994, that a search warrant under section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 cannot issue against `Telecom' premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DPP opinion referred to the ruling by the full Federal Court in Rogers-v-Moore (1993) 115ALR 347, which held that section 10 was not expressed to bind the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that on the 22 September 1994 the DPP advised the AFP that, "There is an argument that a search warrant will lie against the premises of Telstra".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 26 of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 provides that Telstra, more commonly known as `Telecom', is taken for the purpose of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws, not to be an "instrumentality or agency of the Crown" and "not to be entitled to any immunity or privilege of the Commonwealth" unless a law expressly provides otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department advised that there is no provision in the Crimes Act which provides that Telstra is to be treated as if it were the Crown for the purposes of section 10.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the matters raised by Senator Spindler query the adequacy of the AFP investigation in light of the original advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that an interim brief is presently under consideration by the DPP. As I understand the situation the director, Mr Michael Rozenes QC, will personally consider the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DPP is an independent statutory office, I remind the Senate that if the DPP forms an opinion that further enquiries need to be made into any of the matters disclosed by the AFP investigation, or that further investigation needs to be made, then he can request for that to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For obvious reasons I am reluctant at this time to discuss the AFP investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I am assured by the AFP that, as indicated in the Senate on Monday 17 October, that the DPP advice had little or no effect on the final outcome of the AFP investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to make it clear that this government has not applied `external pressure' on the AFP or the DPP over this investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice the DPP provided on 4 March was simply wrong. The AFP, having sought legal advice naturally complied with it and sought the information required by other means. That is all there is to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Senator Spindler's request for tabling of the DPP's advisings this government is generally reluctant to table advice, particularly when it relates to current operational matters. However, as the matter relates specifically to a point of law I am prepared to table that part of the DPP's original advice relating to that matter. I am informed that the second advice, offered on 22 September, was verbal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for the advice from the Attorney-General's Department that was tendered to the Minister for Justice as a result of the matters raised by Senator Spindler. I have provided full details of that advice earlier in this answer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your request of 28 February 1994 for clarification of three points in relation to your investigation into the above matter and provide the following by way of answer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You ask whether a search warrant can be obtained for premises occupied by "Telecom". The answer is, no. As you recall the decision in Rogers v Moore and Others (1993) 41FCR301, a decision of the Full Federal Court, was to the effect that Section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 does not authorise the issue of a warrant to enter and search the premises of the Crown in right of a State. It is further authority for the proposition that the Crown in right of the Commonwealth can not be the subject of such a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOTC was created through the merger of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation (Telecom) and OTC Limited. Like its predecessors the new body AOTC is owned by the Commonwealth which has the sole right to shares and to vote and is not able, by statutory prohibition, to divest itself of shares or voting rights. Further, the Minister has the right to give the Company directions concerning any matter. In 1993 AOTC adopted `Telstra' as the trading name for use outside Australia and as the Company name in lieu of AOTC. I am in no doubt from the legislation that Telstra is in fact an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and as such a warrant may not be directed towards it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Federal Court has been granted and the matter is listed for hearing in mid March. It would not be proper to approach a Magistrate or Justice to seek to have a warrant issue contrary to the Rogers v Moore decision.</PARA>

<PARA>This document is a very substantial let-down for all those people who, after at least 18 months, were expecting a fair bit of coherence in terms of strategy and some fairly precise indications of who would be receiving specific funding and, of course, it is a let-down for a number of people who thought they were entitled to rely on solemn pre-election promises. The National Museum is probably the high-water mark of perfidiousness because, quite clearly, the government's promise on the museum was given with very great intent. It was the centrepiece of the government's arts policy prior to the last election. Those of us who have inspected the collection, as I have several times, would know that it has one of the most extensive collections of Aboriginal art, particularly Arnhem Land bark paintings, which long ago ought to have been on public display. Prior to the last election, the government never contemplated that it should be somehow put to one side and treated as a virtual museum. It ought to be seen in context. It ought to be regarded as part of our cultural heritage, as a unique aspect but, nonetheless, as part of an integrated whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we have had a pure exercise in political self-indulgence&mdash;a megalomaniac Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has his own views and versions of what constitutes culture. He is sure into culture, but not Australian culture. If it is all about trawling through art galleries and antique shops, if it takes him to the other side of the world, it is fine. He is very keen on it and loves to do the rounds of the galleries in Europe. But if it comes to looking at Australian architecture and Australian culture, all we get is a Prime Minister bagging those with a Hill's hoist and those who cannot afford more than a quarter-acre block. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very disappointing to find that we cannot at least have a national museum, like every other country in the OECD, that will bring together all of those items in a central repository. It is a matter of concern to me that some solemn assurances were given not just prior to the last election, but subsequent to the last election. I will indicate the concern that I have in that area in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to draw the Senate's attention to the total failure of the government to take seriously the notion of cultural exports. If one seriously acknowledged that we have a trade imbalance of about 5:1 and that there is a lot more we can do to coordinate art exports, one would set up a specific cultural exports board that would bring together those with expertise in the areas of importance, such as marketing; instead, that vital area is handed over to the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, bureaucrats are once again running the show. We already have bureaucrats in foreign affairs, trade and other departments with this so-called responsibility, but none of it is being brought together in any coordinated manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few things on this subject, particularly in the context of the National Museum, because Senator Alston really is gilding the lily in his usual fashion on this particular subject. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said last week in parliament, the government does not intend to disband the National Museum; on the contrary. We said at the last election that we would provide $26 million for the construction of the National Museum if the museum could raise the equivalent amount from the private sector, which to date has not occurred. It remains the case that to establish the museum on the basis that was originally contemplated remains a very big ask indeed when that support is not coming from other than strictly governmental sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble was that, while other aspects of the museum's outreach activities were being addressed through travelling exhibitions and exhibitions at Old Parliament House and Yarramundi, under those circumstances in particular we would not be able to see any progress, at least not quickly, on the development of the Gallery of Aboriginal Australia, which everyone has acknowledged to be at the core, at the heart and the centrepiece of the museum's collection and the material that exists for that particular purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have decided to treat as a priority the establishment of the Gallery of Aboriginal Art, to establish it as a major physical centre on the Acton site, which is the old Canberra Hospital site&mdash;a magnificent site effectively in the centre of Canberra. It will be a stand-alone institution involving ATSIC and the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, with the Gallery of Aboriginal Australia built as part of that. It will be a magnificent facility and it will be at the core and the heart of the clear original concept of the National Museum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not intended that the National Museum disband its existing collection of non-Aboriginal material. That will continue to be exposed at the Yarramundi site, which will not be disbanded, notwithstanding the fulminations that Senator Alston is going on with about doubts to that effect, statutory declarations and so on. The Yarramundi site, as I understand it, will be maintained. Moreover, National Museum displays will continue at other window outlets of the Sydney Customs House and the Old Parliament House and, in that direct physical way, that aspect of Australia's social history will be brought to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, it is proposed, as I said in the course of question time, that a new concept be developed for outreach in terms of not only this particular collection but also, hopefully, the collections over time of all the major national collecting institutions in Australia. Through the development of CD-based multimedia broadband services of one kind or another there will be access to these collections by many more Australians than would be the case if it were established as a single, stand-alone facility in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What might evolve in the future so far as another physical facility for the remainder of that collection is concerned is a matter for the future, but for the moment far and away the most important and largest component of the National Museum collection will be housed, and housed in a way that will do us all proud. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of cultural exports, to which Senator Alston also made another unhelpful contribution&mdash;and he is leaving the chamber now, of course, having said his little piece&mdash;it is the case that the government considered whether or not to establish a separate stand-alone organisation to advance the cause of cultural exports. But we took the view that on balance, rather than devoting scarce resources to establishing yet another separate bureaucracy, it was more important to get the appropriate linkages working between Austrade, which has an existing responsibility for cultural export promotion, and the expertise that resides in the Australia Council. A significant amount of money will be allocated to enable those exports to be stimulated and developed in that way, but in a way that is more cost effective than through creating, as I said, yet another bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the orchestras, I think that question has been answered in question time. It is not in any sense the government's intention to sever the capacity of or to set adrift the non-Sydney ABC symphony orchestras. They perform a tremendously significant role in their respective states. Indeed, it is to be hoped that they will continue to play that role and have an enhanced role in that respect in the future. But it is possible, we believe, if we establish some new less restrictive funding arrangements, to enable at least one&mdash;maybe more than that over time, but at least one&mdash;orchestra to acquire the level of standing, performance skills and performance capacity that will make it a genuinely, absolutely unequivocally, international class orchestra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand those on the other side who do not share that aspiration for Australia to have such an orchestra, but that once again, I am afraid, simply demonstrates the narrow-mindedness which is endemic on the other side of politics. </PARA>

While the minister at the table sneers at that, his own statement recognises it. That is why I say that is the most important part of the statement, because it removes the capacity for people like Senator Evans to carry on in that childish way.

It is a mirror all right because the government is looking into everything. There are very few positive statements of what it is going to do. As I said, I commend a great many of those statements, but all through this statement the government says that it will `examine' such and such&mdash;in one case it says `endeavour to examine'.

<PARA>It is a matter of profound regret that this long war, which has now gone on for over five years, cost at least 3,000 lives, and disrupted and dislocated the lives of tens of thousands of other people, has not been brought to a peaceful conclusion by the negotiations which began in Arawa approximately 10 days ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very hopeful beginning, there was reason for optimism, and the negotiations seemed full of promise. A cease-fire agreement was in place between the government of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville revolutionary forces. There had been direct face-to-face contact at the highest level in Honiara between Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and Commander Sam Kauona.

This has proved to be an opportunity squandered. It is a real tragedy in the making. It is not an opportunity that is likely to arise easily or readily again. I hope the opportunities present themselves again, but a solution will not be easily accomplished. In that respect, the Arawa talks, which, as the foreign minister said, broke down last Friday, must be placed with the earlier Honiara endeavour accord, which also failed to bring an end to the island troubles. Those agreements, too, were obviously negotiated with a degree of good faith. They offered much promise, but the promise went unrealised.

Even a helicopter was suggested at one stage to guarantee the BRA's leadership safe passage to and from the talks. These are all issues which, doubtless, historians will canvass in the future. I place on record this afternoon that I am very troubled by the allegations of incidents over the past week or so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the failure of the last several days, the cease-fire on Bougainville must be maintained. Senator Gareth Evans was absolutely correct in focusing on that. The island cannot be permitted by either side to slide back into turmoil, conflict and killing. That would simply compound the tragedy and turn the tragedy into an absolute catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few days ago I was visited in this place by Ms Ruby Mirenka, courtesy of Community Aid Abroad. Ms Mirenka had come from behind the blockade maintained by PNGDF in part on Bougainville to talk with people in public life here in government and the parliament about the cost in human terms of the civil war; the cost to ordinary Bougainvilleans, particularly the children. Just as our parliamentary delegation in April saw directly the costs in terms of the areas that we visited across the island, Ms Mirenka was able to describe in very graphic terms what had happened behind the blockade and to show through photographic evidence just what the cost had been to ordinary Bougainvilleans and their families. The photographs of children in pain because they were lacking in the most basic medical support were just heart rending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt from the conversation which I had with Ms Mirenka that behind the blockade the desire is for peace and a return to harmony and normalcy.

I call upon everyone involved in this dispute to maintain the contact, to endeavour to maintain the momentum for discussions, to maintain the cease-fire and to look to a neutral place for a resumption of talks&mdash;perhaps on our shores. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Loosley said, we are naturally very disappointed that the talks have broken down. I wonder just how committed Sam Kauona and Francis Ona are. Obviously they are very brave men. They have proved that by leading a guerilla army. They have used the excuse that they were too frightened to come in and sit down to talks. Perhaps they should have thought about the people that Senator Loosley talked about&mdash;the women and children on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the women were the ones who went back to the villages and tried to get these rebels to come in and sit down to talk reinforces what we saw on the ground.

They can see what the long-term effects of the destruction will be for them and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What impressed me the most when the delegation visited Bougainville was that the women were the most concerned. The women demonstrated quite openly to us that they were the ones who wanted to go back to their villages. They wanted peace. Sure, the men felt the same way but, as we all know from Bougainville's culture, the women are the</PARA>
<PARA>ones who set the scene. It was brought home to us very strongly when we went through the refugee camps and saw the conditions that people were living under that it is the women and children who are suffering. The longer this civil war continues, the longer it will take to get some normalcy back into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, would like to say how impressed I am with Sir Julius Chan. Meeting the man, listening and talking to him, as the delegation did, left no doubt in my mind that he is committed wholeheartedly to peace.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all Australians would urge the Australian government to intensify its efforts, if possible, to get them back to the conference table and, by whatever means, to try and impress upon the BRA that they should sit down and that the cease-fire must hold.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian politicians used to have a very strong relationship with PNG, probably because of the travel arrangements that existed at that time. I am being very open about this. We could fly to PNG on our normal parliamentary allowance. The fact that it is now classed as an overseas trip perhaps encourages people to go further. I believe that in those days there was a much closer relationship between the PNG government and the Australian parliament. I hope that we can return to something like that position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the National Party in the Senate (Senator BosweIl) this day, relating to drought assistance to small business.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret that Senator Schacht has again shown no compassion for or understanding whatsoever of the way that small businessmen are being affected by the drought. I have been raising this matter for a couple of months, asking this government to seriously consider the impact of the effects of drought upon small business. Senator Schacht mused as to why no-one, apart from Senator Boswell, would ask him a question. I am surprised that Senator Boswell even asked him a question because one always gets a complete non-answer from Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day Senator Schacht was completely caught out when he could not even answer a dorothy dixer question that he wrote for himself. It is no wonder that Senator Schacht is not asked any questions about small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that he is not in the chamber, because I do not like doing this in his absence. But he is a minister of the Crown and he should put in an appearance in the chamber every now and again to do what he is paid to do and make a contribution to this house. As with most things, Senator Schacht simply does not have the understanding or the competence to realise what small business needs and what affects it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht's only experience in small business was in turning the Labor Party in South Australia from a big business into a very small one. It is again no surprise to me or to anyone in this chamber why he is struggling to maintain his preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues in relation to small business in drought affected areas that the chamber should be aware of. The president of the Queensland Retailers Association has confirmed that many small businesses in rural Australia are suffering. He quotes the instance of five businesses that have gone out of operation because of the drought, and they are, in many instances, carrying debts of up to $150,000 because they extended credit to farmers when the banks would not and when this government was too lousy to look at the question of drought relief when it should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been a question of whether the drought started on 1 July or any other date; it has been creeping up. The government has been warned, but chose to ignore it completely until very recent times. As a result of that, these small businessmen are having great difficulty in continuing to operate. The tragedy of that for regional Australia is that many of these businesses will not reopen when the drought breaks. They have been forced out of small communities, they will not reopen, and it simply means that another one of the small communities in Australia's regional areas fades into history. Senator Schacht has no interest in that. He does not understand in any way what small business needs to do. I know that Senator Robert Ray thinks this is all a bit of a joke. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter on 12 October week, relating to blood supply products distributed by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook said today that an indemnity had indeed been  given with respect to the documents covering the sale of CSL and that that indemnity covered plasma which had been mixed from sources from Australia and, in this case, from Papua New Guinea. The background to the question is that, while the incidence of hepatitis infection in Australia in the general community is about one in 500, the incidence of hepatitis infection among those who have received CSL products and are suffering from haemophilia is over 80 per cent. Over 80 per cent of the 1,600 haemophilia sufferers are so infected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of this to CSL lies in two observations. One is that there is on the record&mdash;and I have already drawn attention to this&mdash;a letter from CSL dated 1986 in which CSL admits that it was mixing plasma not only from Australia and New Zealand but also from Papua New Guinea, from Pacific islands and from South-East Asia. So concerned was the Australian Red Cross about this practice that the Australian Red Cross wrote to CSL asking it to desist from this practice. The Red Cross had had legal advice that it could not therefore guarantee the safety of CSL products, which the Red Cross itself was then using to treat patients with a variety of diseases, including haemophilia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL refused to comply with the request from the Red Cross and continued with the practice&mdash;as far as we are aware&mdash;until December 1992. There is a letter in existence&mdash;to which I have also drawn attention&mdash;in which the Red Cross said that it would therefore, on legal advice, refuse to continue with the use of CSL products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has replied that the government gave an indemnity to the purchasers of CSL, when CSL was privatised, with respect to plasma from Papua New Guinea but not from these other countries. Also, the prospectus did not, when CSL was sold, give any information to prospective buyers of CSL shares that CSL had been mixing plasma from these other sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bit of information relevant here is that there is considerable evidence that plasma from Hong Kong was heavily contaminated with hepatitis C and that the pooled plasma from Hong Kong was not tested for it. As CSL said, hepatitis C infection was endemic in Hong Kong, so it assumed that all the blood plasma would be contaminated. But donors of blood in Hong Kong were not tested before the samples were taken. Here we have a clear link between the mixing of these plasmas by CSL and the real possibility that the infection rate is so high in haemophilia sufferers in Australia because they have been treated with a contaminated CSL product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by pointing out that, although this information is in the record as a result of the two questions I have asked and the two short speeches I have made taking note of answers, the media seem rather uninterested in taking up this matter. It seems that either the government or CSL or both are attempting to disparage the status of Catherine Beauchamp, the author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Alert</EMPHASIS>, by spreading stories that she is against blood transfusions, which she is not, or that she has fabricated the letters to which I have drawn attention, which I believe she has not. It seems that the government or CSL or both are very worried about the effect of these revelations on the possible value of CSL. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 25 August 1994 concerning the Training Guarantee (Administration) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 176.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations remove the application of the Training Guarantee from Zone A of the Timor Gap. The Australia-Indonesia Zone of Co-operation Treaty deals with the development of petroleum resources in the disputed waters between Australia and Indonesia. The Zone of Co-operation is divided into three areas. The area in question, Zone A, is under joint Australian/Indonesian control. Zone B is under Australian control and Zone C under Indonesian control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treaty requires agreement between Australia and Indonesia over the introduction of any new taxes in Zone A. The regulations in question became necessary in July 1993 when the Indonesian Government advised that it did not agree to the application of the Training Guarantee in that Zone. Because the Training Guarantee should not have been introduced in the Zone without Indonesian agreement, it was necessary to make the regulations retrospective to remove its application right back to the Training Guarantee's introduction on 1 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, there are a few exploration companies operating in the area. Some are small companies while others are part of much larger oil companies. Enquiries made before the discussions with the Indonesians indicate that both types employ skilled personnel and provide much more training than is required under the Training Guarantee. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that any of them would have lodged training guarantee shortfall statements or that there will be any requests for repayment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 25 August 1994 concerning the Classification of Publications (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 3) 1994 (the amending Ordinance).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you note, the amending Ordinance provides, in part, for the retrospective liability to pay a fee for an application to review a decision approving or refusing to approve the classification of a film or advertising matter in relation to a film. It also provides that any payment made during the relevant period (1 April 1985 to 22 June 1994) is to be taken to have been made in discharge of that liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought my advice on the legislative and administrative considerations which dictated the retrospective liability and the apparent simultaneous discharge of that liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An application to review a decision of the kind referred to above is made under State and Territory legislation. As noted in the Explanatory Statement for the amending Ordinance, the Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed that an application fee of $400 to review a decision would be charged from 1985. This was to be comprised of a fee of $50 levied under the legislation of each of the 8 States and Territories involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fee is a fee for service. Further, the fees collected represent only a nominal contribution to the cost of providing the service. It is an `up-front' fee, that is, the fee is payable before an application for review can be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On being made aware of the failure to make a fee determination in 1985 to give effect to the Ministers' decision in respect of the ACT component, the Government was clearly required to take action to redress the problem. It was considered that the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances was to adopt a direct approach and to legislate to rectify the problem. This course was not taken lightly in view of the undesirability, as a general rule, of retrospective legislation&mdash;which is reflected in the strict approach that the Committee adopts in relation to such provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision was taken in the context that the fee retrospectively levied was the fee agreed upon by the Commonwealth, States and Territories when the fee was introduced in 1985, that it had been collected in good faith and that the services to which the fee relates have been delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was, of course, never any intention to levy, retrospectively, a higher fee than that previously agreed upon and collected. This is reflected in the amendment itself which immediately after levying the fee retrospectively, then discharges that liability on the basis of payment of the fee having already been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also asks whether in the absence of the retrospectivity any fees paid during the relevant period would have had to be refunded. The short answer to this is that a person who had paid the fee would generally have been able to bring an action to recover it, but that in the absence of any claim the Commonwealth was not under any legal obligation to repay the fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Committee's question about the amounts involved, the Office of Film and Literature Classification have informed me that, according to its records, 23 applications were involved during the relevant period. The Principal Ordinance, of course, only relates to films (usually video tapes) for sale or hire. The ACT component of the total fee applicable would thus have been $1350.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance to the Committee in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it is a matter of dissension in the inquiry, as I understand it. The Auditor-General went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I endeavoured to establish an independent inquiry into the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event, a Judicial Inquiry was established by the Government to examine all aspects of the leasing arrangements. Mr Trevor Morling, QC, was appointed in May 1994 to conduct the Inquiry under the Royal Commissions Act. Mr Morling's report is expected to be finalised towards the end of October 1994, and I am looking forward to this putting an end to the controversy surrounding the issue. I also look forward to the Government's review of the level of ANAO's resources following the outcome of the Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the central issue. The rental arrangement&mdash;and this is not a matter of dispute before the inquiry&mdash;would have been such as to severely damage the viability of the Auditor-General's office because of the huge rent rise of something like nine per cent per annum that would have flowed from the Auditor-General to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that the Auditor-General is saying in this report that the next few months represent a crucial period for the Audit Office, not only because of the Centenary House matter and whether or not the government will make good the extraordinary loss of funds that would flow from payment of that lease if that lease survives, but also because of the expected passage of the legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901, along with the conclusion of the Audit Office's restructuring. That is still, the Auditor-General says, inhibited by an order of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission relating to that restructuring and, as I said, the finalisation of the Centenary House inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General goes on to say that he is greatly encouraged by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts support for providing the Auditor-General with the authority to set his own terms and conditions of staff of the Audit Office and for the establishment of an audit committee of the parliament. I might say in passing that I regret that the JCPA has backed down a little from the position that it had taken on the issue. But the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these important building blocks, the prospect of a long-term improvement in the ANAO's funding position, and the continuing commitment and professionalism of all the staff of the ANAO, I am cautiously optimistic that the ANAO will continue to provide the Parliament, the Executive and the community with a valued service well into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>The important part of his report was contained in the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now up to the Parliament to decide what it, rather than the Government or its agencies, wants from the Auditor-General and the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the central issue. As a member of parliament, I have found the Auditor-General's reports to be an essential element in the proper performance of my functions as someone who is keen to ensure that there is detailed and effective scrutiny of the activities of this government. Heaven knows, this government needs that kind of detailed and effective scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has been fearless in his criticisms. The government finds some of those criticisms unacceptable. As the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) mentioned today, some of those criticisms generate some disagreement on quite reasonable grounds. There is no doubt, however, that the Auditor-General and his office have shown themselves to be a diligent servant of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As he notes in his own report, the quality of the audits has improved markedly&mdash;and I endorse this view&mdash;in the area of the two core products of financial audits and performance audits. The Auditor-General gives credit for that to the enormous commitment, dedication and goodwill of staff which has enabled the Audit Office to come through the challenging period of recent times very well. He says, as I accept:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and our performance audits have become more focused and better targeted as a result of improved liaison with both the Parliament and auditees.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal briefly with that question about his reporting to the parliament. The highlights of this report are to the effect that, of the 430 audit opinions on the financial statements processed for 1993-94, 393 were unqualified, leaving 37 qualified. The ANOA report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 1,000 recommendations were made to Ministers, boards and/or senior management for better collection and payment of public moneys, the protection of assets and improvements in financial management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical standards have been further enhanced and relations with auditees have been strengthened despite a period of staff shortages and budgetary constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contracting has continued to be used to provide specialised skills and to assist the Audit Office with peak workloads.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other aspect of the Auditor-General's activities, which is in performance audits, as the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year has produced a number of highlights, marked by an increased awareness and use by the Parliament of the Auditor-General's audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audit reports tabled during the year covered a wide range of public administrative issues. Resulting recommendations have focused on improving the administration of public sector entities and encouraging the ongoing development of good management and public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94, 66 performance audits were tabled. If recommendations in these reports are implemented, the ANAO estimates there will be potential savings of $16m initially plus ongoing savings of up to $59m per year.</PARA>
<PARA>As a member of this Senate, I commend the Auditor-General for his efforts and I welcome his annual report for 1993-94. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to comment briefly on the Auditor-General's annual report, or the annual report of the Australian National Audit Office for 1993-94. At the outset I wish to congratulate the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, and his staff on what I think has been an extraordinarily good and productive year under very difficult circumstances which, as he says in the opening line, has been a year of marked contrasts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record my appreciation&mdash;and I am sure I speak for the whole of the coalition&mdash;of the work of John Taylor as Auditor-General. I think I am right in saying that he retires early next year. So I understand that this annual report will be the last annual report produced by the Audit Office with John Taylor as the Auditor-General. He has been a remarkable Auditor-General. He has shown an independence of spirit, initiative and courage that are very rare in public office, particularly when one is as exposed to criticisms as an Auditor-General is in public office. We owe John Taylor and his very supportive staff a great debt of gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my friend Senator Michael Baume said, we on this side of the parliament&mdash;and I hope all members of parliament&mdash;find the reports of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office of enormous help. Indeed, as an opposition it would be very difficult to do our work effectively without those reports. That is an essential part of the role of the Audit Office and the Auditor-General. As he says at page 3 of his annual report at paragraph 1.7:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has a central place in the process of public accountability. The Executive is accountable to the Parliament, and through the Parliament to the community, for the stewardship of the resources the Parliament has provided to it. Ministers are accountable to the Parliament, although the extent of that accountability varies in the case of statutory authorities and government-owned or controlled companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me interpose there that far too often in our system of government, and particularly under the Hawke and Keating governments of the past 11 years, there has been far too little recognition by ministers of the fact that they are accountable to the parliament and to the public and that they are not a law unto themselves, as we have seen far too often apparently to be the case. We are seeing that at the moment with the performance of Minister Brereton in his roles in industrial relations and also in transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his report, the Auditor-General draws attention to the fact that some of the recommendations of audit reports that were made in 1993-94, which were aimed at improving public administration, have largely been accepted by the agencies that were subject to review. It is commendable that in 1993-94 those reports included recommendations for savings in budget outlays totalling no less than $75 million, including ongoing savings of $59 million per annum. That is a notable achievement and one which I am sure the Audit Office will continue to build on in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his annual report, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing inflexible and insufficient funding arrangements do not allow the ANAO to operate on an appropriate basis, let alone identify potential savings which may be shared with the staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an enormous indictment of the government. For the government to have to starve such an essential body of funds and to have such inflexibility in terms of the funding arrangements, when the Audit Office is the watchdog of the public purse, I find extraordinary and very much regrettable. It should be welcomed that the government has announced that it will review the funding for the ANAO, following the outcome of the inquiry into Centenary House&mdash;one can only hope. I urge the government to look very carefully at providing greater flexibility and adequacy of funding to the Audit Office in the course of and as a result of that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the government has to wait until the completion of the inquiry into the Audit Office's accommodation in Centenary House. I think that is one of the less respectable events of recent times. So far as accommodation of government departments and agencies is concerned, the fact that the Audit Office took the accommodation in Centenary House without its being revealed that the owner of the building was the Australian Labor Party is, I believe, a disgraceful omission on the part of the government departments concerned. It is there that the criticism lies, rather than with the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the inquiry will look at all of those matters, and I would not pretend to pre-empt that inquiry. But the fact of the Audit Office being accommodated in the building owned by a political party is something that everyone hopefully&mdash;certainly on this side of politics, and I am sure the Audit Office itself&mdash;regards as unsatisfactory. It is worth noting that the Auditor-General himself endeavoured to establish an independent inquiry into this matter. In the event, of course, a judicial inquiry was established by the government to examine all aspects of the leasing arrangements, but I think it should be on the record that the Auditor-General himself endeavoured to establish an independent inquiry into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw attention to the fact that we have had an incredible five-year delay on the part of this government in the introduction of the promised legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. There has been the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Accounts report on the necessary and desirable changes to the Audit Act and the whole of the legislative basis for the Audit Office. It has been there for five years. The government promised three or four years ago, at least&mdash;I remember I was involved in estimates committees on it at the time&mdash;to introduce that legislation. I think the earliest commitment on the government's part was something like three years ago. The date kept slipping and slipping, not just by weeks or by months, but by years. Fortunately, at last we have had legislation introduced, and I hope that it will be the basis of and the underpinning for the stability and the future development in desirable ways of the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Audit Office is particularly important. It has some very important tasks at hand at the moment, not the least of which is the inquiry it is undertaking at the behest and request of this chamber to enable the parliament and the public to make an informed assessment of the Australian National Line's financial position. It is a financial situation which we have seen under this government, particularly the handling by it of the present minister, go into an absolutely disgraceful state over recent months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and Minister Brereton, the Minister for Industrial Relations, have acted in a way which has greatly damaged the ANL. It has greatly damaged the value of the ANL at a time when the government itself was trying to privatise the shipping line with the coalition's support. The government has bowed to the muscle of the maritime union in a way which has caused great damage to the line and the shipping industry in Australia. The financial implications of that are very grave indeed, and I and the coalition look forward very much to the Auditor-General's report into some of those matters. I believe and hope that it will provide a basis for this parliament to have an assessment of the activities of ANL and of this government, particularly this current minister in relation to ANL. That is essential in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to welcome the report for 1993-94 of the Australian National Audit Office.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY (1994 BUDGET AND WHITE PAPER) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a range of important reforms in the social security portfolio, stemming primarily from the 1994 budget and the government's 1994 white paper on employment and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The white paper has provided a valuable opportunity for a fundamental review of the income support system for unemployed people. The current system has been outpaced by social and labour market changes and the changing structure of employment&mdash;changes such as a higher incidence of long term unemployment, greater participation by women in the workforce, increasing part-time and casual work and a decreasing gap between low wages and income support. The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. Further measures contained in the white paper will be included in social security legislation to be introduced later in these Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to commence in March 1995 will broaden the range of work-related options that the long term unemployed, and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed, can pursue while continuing to receive income support. These options will include developing and participating in group or co-operative enterprises, more courses of study and training approved by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and a wider range of voluntary unpaid work such as on environmental projects or community and cultural activities. Also, eligible clients will be able to continue to receive income support for up to 12 months while developing self-employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further important reform is the introduction of two advance payment options for eligible job search and newstart allowance clients. After 3 months on payment, clients will have access to an up-front lump sum payment of up to $500 to assist in job search and other activities related to finding paid employment. For the long term unemployed, and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed, there is an option to take an advance of their income support of up to $1,000 for activities approved by their case manager as assisting their return to work and included in the client's Job Search or Newstart Activity Agreement. In either case, the proportion of payments to be advanced will be limited to 14 per cent of the rate of allowance (not including remote area allowance). The period over which future payments may be advanced will be up to 6 months for the $500 option and 12 months for the $1,000 option. The remaining fortnightly payment will be paid in the usual way. There will be no interest charged and advances will be available only to clients who can show that they have the ability to manage their finances while taking up this option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To qualify for job search or newstart allowance, a client must satisfy the secretary that he or she is taking reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a Job Search or Newstart Activity Agreement. It is also generally necessary to satisfy the activity test either by actively seeking and being willing to undertake paid work that is, in the secretary's opinion, suitable for the person, or by taking reasonable steps to comply with a requirement to undertake certain activity. There have been broadly varying decisions made about what constitutes suitable work and what steps are reasonable. As a result, the application of the legislation has lacked uniformity and has caused confusion for clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill rectifies this inconsistency by codifying the suitable work and reasonable steps issues. In future, the emphasis will be altered to create a presumption that any paid work is suitable unless the secretary forms the opinion that it is unsuitable for the person. A range of circumstances will be prescribed to establish that the work is unsuitable such as the client lacking the requisite skills, experience or qualifications for the job, the existence of a pre-existing illness or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions of work and the wages of a job not covered by an existing award being below the minimum rate for comparable work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasonable steps issue will be addressed by a new provision that deems a client not to have taken reasonable steps to comply with the activity test or the terms of a Job Search or Newstart Activity Agreement. This will apply if the main reason for failing to comply involves a matter that is within the control of the client or if the circumstances which prevented the client from complying were reasonably foreseeable by the client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes the job search, newstart and sickness allowance liquid assets test more equitable. This test is essentially a deferral of payment to a client whose "liquid assets" (that is, cash and readily realisable assets) exceed established thresholds. First, the liquid assets waiting period will apply to clients only once in any 12 month period instead of each time a claim is made. Secondly, allowance will be made for a client's liquid assets to be reduced by any one-off lump sum payment of non-housing related debts such as clearance of a car loan. Also, the proceeds of the sale of the client's home may be deducted as long as settlement occurred in the last 12 months and the money is to be used to buy another home. Lastly, avoidance of the liquid assets test will be prevented by having it apply to both the client and their partner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill relaxes the residence requirements for refugees applying for certain social security pensions. The qualification criteria for most pensions require a period of qualifying residence or a continuous period of being an Australian resident. As a result, refugees cannot qualify for most pension payments. It will now be possible for refugees to satisfy the residence requirements as long as they reside in Australia and hold a class of visa approved by the Minister for Social Security. Provided that other qualification criteria are satisfied, refugees will have access to Australian pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More equity is being introduced into the payment of additional family payment outside Australia. At present, additional family payment can continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks if the qualified person is absent from Australia as long as the child remains in Australia with the other parent. The unintended effect of this on sole parents is that they lose additional family payment as soon as they leave Australia because they have no partner in Australia to care for the child. In the case of a couple, it also precludes payment of additional family payment if both parents leave Australia. This restriction is being relaxed to allow for additional family payment to continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks to a qualified person who is outside Australia, whether or not the person has a partner who remains in Australia with the child. It will still be a requirement that the child remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill closes a loophole in the provisions that allow the value of certain employer provided fringe benefits to be taken into account under the family payment income test and the parental income test for job search and sickness allowance recipients aged under 18. Some employees may be paid rental or mortgage subsidy payments that are not captured by the fringe benefit provisions in the Social Security Act because they are cash payments. Amendments are now being made that will result in these payments being treated as income for the relevant income tests if the payments made by an employer to an employee are to assist the employee to meet costs associated with a housing loan or rental payments. However, this bill also includes special measures for Defence Force members so that low cost housing or a housing rental payment are given a lower fringe benefits value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act contains definitions that refer to certain sections in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the calculation of an undeducted purchase price (UPP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to these social security definitions are necessary in the light of recent amendments made to the calculation of UPPs under the Tax Act. They will ensure that there is not an unintended tightening of the income test treatment of pensions and annuities taken out on or after 1 July 1994. That is, the status quo will remain for social security purposes. This will be achieved by applying the pre-1 July 1994 income tax definition of UPP for social security purposes so that social security clients with superannuation investment products purchased with eligible termination payments will be treated the same irrespective of when they purchased these products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY (NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the incorporation into the Social Security Act 1991 of the new social security agreement that was signed by Australia and New Zealand on 19 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1943, Australia and New Zealand signed a `host country' Social Security Agreement under which each country agreed to pay pensions to residents who had come from the other country. Reimbursement arrangements have gradually been introduced to ensure that the arrangement can withstand imbalances in migration patterns between the countries. During the latter part of the 1980s there was a significant net intake of New Zealanders into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Agreement takes account of the ease with which people may travel between Australia and New Zealand. It means that neither country will suddenly face an excessive burden in paying pensions to people who have spent most or all of their working lives in the other country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new agreement, New Zealand will reimburse Australia for pensions paid to people from New Zealand with less than 10 years residence in Australia during their working life. Australia will similarly reimburse New Zealand for the pensions it pays to people from Australia. The level of reimbursement in these cases will be based broadly on the percentage of a person's working life spent in each country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Agreement provides a far more equitable sharing of the cost of pensions paid to people who move between Australia and New Zealand. These new cost sharing arrangements are to begin from 1 January 1995, the date the new Agreement comes into effect and will cover all new arrivals from that date. The arrangements will be phased in over five years for people who arrived after 1 January 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reimbursements by New Zealand to Australia are likely to triple over the next three years and then rise to around $90 million a year as arrangements are phased in under the new agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994 is to ensure that asylum seekers who have had access to the refugee determination processes in another country should not have access to Australia's system other than in exceptional circumstances. The bill covers two groups of asylum seekers. The first are those covered by the comprehensive plan of action, the CPA, which the Australian government signed in July 1989. The second are those in relation to which there is a safe third country, which I will refer to as STC. This STC concept is new to our onshore refugee screening procedures, and I will come back to it in more detail later in my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, after very wide consultation, has decided to support the bill. However, we believe there are some amendments which should be made to remove some areas of concern. Most of the concerns were raised over the application of the safe third country concept. After careful consideration of the bill, we consider that further improvements and safeguards can be made which, rather than changing the nature or spirit of the legislation, with which the coalition agrees, would enhance its operation and better ensure its fairness, equity and transparency. I will also be moving an amendment to the second reading motion which addresses other legitimate concerns that have been expressed. </PARA>

This has been called `forum shopping'. To allow such asylum seekers access to our protection would be to discriminate against other legitimate asylum seekers who are following the normal processes of application and assessment. We believe this is unfair and should not be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill were defeated there is every likelihood that it would encourage more boat people who have had their applications for asylum rejected, in accordance with the proper procedures of the comprehensive plan of action, to make their way to Australia's shores as unauthorised boat arrivals&mdash;or, in the parlance of the new Migration Act, as illegal non-citizens&mdash;to seek another opportunity to apply for asylum. This would not only undermine the comprehensive plan of action but also put additional pressures on Australia's refugee program and its processing. With many tens of thousands of people in refugee camps throughout Asia alone, let alone in other troubled areas of the world, this would be of major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in this bill have their roots in the refugee situation in the late 1970s and 1980s, when thousands of people fled their home countries, in particular Vietnam and Laos. Many finished up in camps in Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Until the late 1980s, countries of first asylum accepted the arrivals and other countries, including in particular Australia, accepted substantial numbers for permanent resettlement without any great formality or problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that I take very great pleasure and pride in being a member of the political party and government&mdash;the Liberal Party and the Fraser Liberal-National Party coalition government of the second half of the 1970s&mdash;that were responsible, despite strong opposition from various quarters, including, I must say, the Labor Party at that time, for the initial welcoming to Australia of the Vietnamese refugees and the other Indochinese refugees who were desperately seeking new homes for resettlement at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, pressures built up in the late 1980s, particularly with respect to the huge number of boat people who fled to Hong Kong. In July 1989 an international conference on Indochinese refugees was held in Geneva. The major result of the conference was a comprehensive plan of action to apply to Vietnamese and Lao people who arrived in first asylum countries after the cut-off date, which ranged from June 1988 through to March 1989, depending on the country concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CPA, the first step in the procedure is to determine whether the person is a refugee or not. In other words, the previous virtually automatic assumption of refugee status was revoked. This is determined in accordance with the United Nations 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 protocol. The CPA provides that the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is to be involved in the determination process and that the UN handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status is to be the authoritative guide to determining a person's status. The CPA also provides for consistent region-wide refugee status decision making. One of the principles of the CPA was that, in accordance with article 33 of the United Nations 1951 convention:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 33 basically ensures that applicants for asylum will not be returned to their country of origin without having their claim for refugee status assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPA was adopted in 1989 by the UNHCR, by the governments of countries from where the refugees originated, namely, Vietnam and Laos, by the countries or territories which offered first asylum to the boat people, namely, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and by countries offering resettlement, including in particular Australia, whose record in this respect is admirable on a world basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPA ensured that Vietnamese and Laotian asylum seekers were given first asylum and were screened for refugee status. Those determined to be refugees were eligible for resettlement. Those determined not to be refugees had to return to their country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some allegations have been raised about the UNHCR's processing of refugees in accordance with the CPA at the Galang camp in Indonesia by members of the Vietnamese Australian community. They allege that the screening procedures in Galang have been corrupted and that many non-refugees were either buying refugee status or gaining it through sexual favours and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been subject to inquiry by the Senate's legal and constitutional affairs committee, which recommended that the bill be enacted. In the course of the inquiry, the UNHCR regional representative assured the committee that, to the UNHCR's knowledge, no applicant for refugee status had been wrongly screened out due to his or her failure to pay a bribe in some form or other. If this is the case, then although these allegations are of a very serious nature and must be examined further&mdash;I will come to that later&mdash;they do not impact directly upon this bill. If anything, those allegations draw attention to those people who may have been granted refugee status in Galang, who may not have been genuine refugees but whom Australia has accepted in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is no evidence of wrongful screening out of refugee applicants in Galang for corrupt reasons, such allegations nevertheless require further investigation. I have therefore circulated a second reading amendment which I will formally move on behalf of the coalition and which calls on the government to strongly request the UNHCR to re-examine and evaluate its mechanisms for reviewing claims of boat people seeking asylum, to better identify those who may have been erroneously processed. The amendment also calls on the minister to table in the Senate such proof of this representation as his written request to the UNHCR, the UNHCR response and the minister's response to the high commissioner's examination and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second reading amendment is very much more than a mere pious amendment. It requires the minister to take action in respect of these matters. If the minister fails to comply with the request, then he will be in serious contempt of the Senate. The coalition moves this amendment following detailed discussions with the Vietnamese Australian community and following representations from other concerned organisations. I would like to pay particular credit to the Vietnamese community in Australia and its national president, Mr Cuong Vo; to the Vietnamese-Australian Welfare Association of New South Wales and its secretary, Duc Nguyen; and to the Vietnamese Refugee Supporting Committee of Victoria and its secretary, Trung Doan, and his other members. There were many other people and organisations who made very important recommendations and representations to us along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of these organisations presented the coalition with an amendment to the bill, the principle of which we agree with completely.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to support this amendment. It is essential that this matter be cleared up and that genuine asylum seekers feel confident of getting a fair hearing of their claims and that a fair decision will be made. To ensure that the government does not simply ignore the Senate's wishes in respect of this matter, assuming the amendment is passed, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be required to table in the Senate by no later than 1 February 1995 a report setting out the details that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this amendment is to create a parliamentary obligation on the minister to perform the tasks outlined in  the return to order, to use the technical term, and to report back to this chamber on those matters. It is a binding obligation which failure to comply with would leave the minister in serious contempt of this Senate, as I said earlier. The legal advice that the coalition has received is that this approach, through an amendment at the second reading stage, carries more weight than would an appropriate equivalent type of amendment to the bill. It is for this reason that the coalition has adopted this method of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill effectively implements the safe third country concept in Australia. It will require that asylum seekers who have arrived in Australia from safe third countries or who have access to safe third countries will be barred from making applications for protection visas. They will be removed to a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the safe third country concept states that someone who has had access to the system of protection in a safe third country will be denied access to Australia's onshore refugee determination processes and will be returned to that safe third country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system which most closely resembles the one proposed in this bill is that of Canada. Canadian legislation states that a person who claims to be a refugee under the 1951 convention and 1967 protocol is not eligible to have the claim determined in Canada if that person came from a prescribed country. As with the system proposed in this current bill, the Canadian system stipulates that a safe third country must be prescribed in regulations. Canada requires an STC to be party to the 1951 convention and, in particular, article 33 of the convention on non-refoulement. It also considers its record on human rights. Prescription lasts for two years, but is renewable. It may be revoked at any time. Canada also recognises refugee sharing arrangements with other countries such as the CPA countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British define an STC as one in which the life or freedom of an asylum applicant would not be threatened within the meaning of article 33 of the UN convention, and the government of which would not send the applicant elsewhere in a manner contrary to the principles of the 1951 convention and 1967 protocol. The provisions under which a country will be a designated safe third country in relation to a non-citizen in the Australian context are set out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The status of a country prescribed as a safe third country is to be subject in the bill to a sunset clause. Unless the status is renewed by regulation, a country is to cease to be a safe third country three years after the commencement of the regulation which initially conferred that status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns have been expressed, particularly by the UNHCR representative in Australia, about the safe third country concept and how it is to work. The first concern is the bill's failure to specifically mention the non-refoulement or article 33 of the 1951 convention. The second relates to the need for STC agreements to include assurances on the country's willingness to accept such asylum seekers and the willingness to permit such a person to remain there until final determination of that person's situation. The UNHCR representative's third concern, which was shared by others, related to the three-year period for renewing STC agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final concern relates to the definition of `the public interest' contained in the bill. Much of the workability of this bill relies heavily on the fact that it must be firm but also fair. Recently, when a boatload of potential asylum seekers landed on our shores, three already assessed cases were granted access to our system of assessment in Galang. It is vital that, if such cases are going to continue to arise, there is flexibility under the act to allow for their reassessment. There is significant scope within this legislation, in the form of ministerial discretion, for flexibility, we believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that all people who arrive by boat, without authorisation, will still be interviewed by officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the way that they have been to date. On the basis of that interview, it will be decided as to whether they come within the scope of this legislation. The department has stated that at this interview, if it is discovered that a potential applicant has new information in support of that person's previously assessed case, that person will be allowed to apply again. However, the only area for such flexibility lies in the minister's non-compellable discretionary powers, which may be exercised only in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be pursuing some of these matters further in the committee stage of the bill, and I have already circulated proposed amendments relating to some of those concerns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. The purpose of the bill is to insert a new subdivision relating to `certain non-citizens unable to apply for certain visas' into division 3 of part 2 of the Migration Act 1958. If passed, these provisions would enable immigration authorities to refuse to even consider visa applications of certain asylum seekers. In other words, they would be turned back without having their claim for refugee status even assessed by Australian authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would be possible in two main situations: where asylum seekers are covered by the comprehensive plan of action, the CPA, which applies to all refugees from Vietnam and Laos, or where the asylum seeker has a prescribed connection with a safe third country. The connection may be that the person was present in that country at a particular time, even for a day, or that the person has a right to enter or reside in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could accept that where a person has a right to enter or reside, that was a reasonable connection with that country. It is a little more difficult to accept that the prescribed connection could include a situation where somebody has simply travelled through that country and stayed for a day, a half day or an hour. The Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment to this clause of the bill to substitute `and' for `or'. This is a request made by the representative of the UNHCR. I think there is a very compelling argument for combining the presence, however brief, with the right to reside, to make the connection more substantive. The government has acknowledged that the purpose of this bill is to prevent people coming to Australia to seek asylum when, firstly, they have been rejected as refugees by a safe third country; secondly, if they have passed through such a country without applying; or, thirdly, if they have a legal right to stay in such a country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit to the Senate that this bill should be opposed. It is an obnoxious bill. It places Australia in breach of its international obligations. Under the refugee convention, Australia has an obligation to determine the legal status of an asylum seeker and not to expel such a person or return that person to wherever he or she could be under threat on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. </PARA>

In essence, it means that we would be prepared to adopt as our own the decisions of another legal system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, as has been mentioned in the chamber before, there are sufficient allegations of bribery as an element in the refugee determination process at the Indonesian reception centre on Galang to reinforce profound unease about the process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point I am raising. Can we rely on the process that has taken place in those countries and has screened them out? I refer Senator Short to three people who arrived in Australia by boat. Although we decided that these three people were properly refugees, they had not been accepted as refugees by the Indonesian process and authorities. Surely, that shows up very clearly the different approach and the different levels of integrity and efficiency. It also shows a different attitude and approach to determining the legal rights that exist in our legal system in Australia and the system in Indonesia where all of the 17 asylum seekers who arrived here on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> were screened out and rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment of the people who arrived here on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> took place before this bill could take effect. Therefore, as Senator Short has said, those three could be found to have been wrongly screened out in Indonesia. Yet our system, properly, has accepted them as being refugees. If nothing else, this event shows the difficulties that this bill poses. I know it has been said that the three were accepted as refugees on the basis of additional advice. However, that is very strenuously and strongly denied by people who have worked with those three and who have legally represented them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No cogent new evidence was offered by the government at the committee hearing or at any other stage. On the contrary, the facts are that on the same basic evidence, the Indonesian authorities said, `These people are not refugees,' and on the same basic evidence the Australian authorities and the Australian process said, `These are refugees.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other points about this bill which I would like to advert to. A safe third country can be so declared for a period of three years. This, very obviously, ignores the possibility of very significant political and constitutional changes in the government of such a country&mdash;changes in the way the legal system operates and the way in which power is exercised in that country. Three years is by far too long a period. I will be moving an amendment to reduce that to two years. I will be moving another amendment to place the obligation on the government to act immediately to put a stop to the status of safe third country if significant changes occur in a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern needs to be put on the table. It is less a legal concern than a political one, because the fact is that this bill shifts the determination process of asylum seekers into the area of foreign affairs, of relations with other countries. There may indeed at any stage be very sound reasons for not declaring a country, yet the Australian government may find it compellingly expedient to do so on foreign relations grounds because not to do so would be seen as an insult. We only have to look at the recent history of our region to accept that relations with our neighbours can, at times, be extremely sensitive and their reactions to what we say and do can be extremely prickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A situation where we would not declare a country&mdash;in other words, where we say in substance, `No, we won't declare you because we don't really trust you'&mdash;would be viewed as an insult by that country. Yet we in Australia would be concerned to foster trade with that country, and I suspect that the principle and the fate of individuals who are asylum seekers would be sacrificed to the economic interests of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that needs to be addressed in this debate is the matter of ministerial discretion. The bill provides this safeguard to the asylum seeker, and the minister has the discretion in the public interest to admit that particular person to the determination process in Australia. However, it is a non-compellable discretion. In other words, the non-exercise of ministerial discretion would not be subject to judicial or administrative challenge, except by prerogative writ under the constitution. It is therefore a fairly illusory safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point to be made in this context is that the representative of UNHCR has suggested that public interest need not necessarily include compelling humanitarian reasons. He has suggested that the bill be amended to ensure that the minister should exercise his discretion where compelling humanitarian reasons are present. I have suggested to the minister that this matter should be addressed in the chamber. I am looking forward to his response to that and to his assurance that the definition of public interest does include compelling humanitarian reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill has a retrospective element. The bill applies to cases which have been commenced in the Australian determination process since 1 September of this year. In summary, I suggest again to honourable senators that we should reject this bill because it puts us in breach of our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the amendments foreshadowed by the coalition parties do not sufficiently cure the defects of the bill to enable us to support it. However, we will support the amendments that the opposition will move because we accept the reality that the bill will probably pass, since the coalition is intent on supporting the government on the basic substance of the bill. Despite the concerns that have been raised not only by the Vietnamese community but by others, the opposition is prepared to support the bill. So while we will put on record our strong opposition by voting against the second reading of the bill, we will also support the opposition's amendments to the second reading as well as during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish that Senator Short had accepted the Vietnamese community's suggestion that what it has asked him to do should be moved as an amendment to the bill rather than as a second reading amendment. Members of the Vietnamese community are on record during a hearing before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs as requesting Australian parliamentarians to ensure that this bill does not pass.

It is legislation that looks at one very important worldwide program conducted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and that is the comprehensive plan of action&mdash;a world action plan for what to do with a large number of people who have fled from their homelands of, generally speaking, Vietnam and Laos.

They should read not only the submissions but also the advocates' evidence when they attended the hearing and were subjected to questioning by members of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wrote to the regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and received a reply from Mr Pierre Michel Fontaine. The United Nations representative denies the allegations, but it was not just a flat denial. Because of the assertions contained in the letter from the Vietnamese community, Mr Fontaine asked for further evidence. Part of Mr Fontaine's letter reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the allegations of Mr. Simon Jeans, previously engaged as a Legal Consultant with UNHCR in Galang, on no occasion did our Office in Indonesia ever receive such information or reports on corruption from him. Having received the report from you, we contacted Mr. Jeans with a view to obtaining names or other details which might assist us in investigating this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr. Jeans has advised us that he is unable to name any UNHCR-recommended case who might have been denied refugee status by the Government of Indonesia due to not being able to pay a bribe. Mr. Jeans also said that, notwithstanding difficulties certain refugees might have had in getting positive decisions at the first instance, he expected UNHCR-recommended cases would be accepted on appeal. He had no knowledge of any specific case ultimately being denied refugee status due to "failing to come up with the cash". It therefore must be said that neither we, nor Mr. Jeans, have been able to identify a single person who was ultimately denied refugee status simply because he or she could not afford to pay a bribe.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that is of great concern to those of us in this parliament who care for people in the world who are in a less fortunate position than ourselves&mdash;those in need of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations contained in the letter from the New South Wales chapter of the Vietnamese community caused concern right across the parliament. I am aware that a number of representations were made to the minister's office regarding the content of the letter. When these things are thrashed through and when evidence is asked for, the evidence is not produced. From my reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the two public hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that evidence still has not been brought forward. Obviously that will leave some doubts in people's minds as to the veracity of the initial claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to direct a few comments to the evidence that was given to the committee in its deliberations on this bill. I am a member of the committee, but unfortunately for personal family reasons I was not able to be present&mdash;much as I would have liked to have been in a position to address questions to the advocates and the witnesses. Those things happen from time to time. I found the transcripts very interesting reading. Summing up, I think the advocates were arguing that it did not really matter if a person had been screened out of the refugee system in another country and had been through appeals; he or she should be given an opportunity in Australia to apply for refugee status. This bill will address that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the advocates have suggested a very dangerous course of action in how to address the problem. It was suggested by at least a couple of groups that people like the people on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> from Galang Island who arrived in Australia should be given access to our Refugee Review Tribunal. In other words, they should be allowed to appeal in Australia against decisions taken in another country. Were the government to accept their recommendations, I wonder what that would do to the whole comprehensive plan of action and its effect on close on 50,000 people who remain in camps throughout South-East Asia&mdash;people who will have to make decisions about their future prior to the end of next year. I am pleased that the government is not accepting the suggestion that the RRT be brought into the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note in those submissions that some people went to some length to say that people like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> people should be given access not only to the RRT but also to our judicial process. I have had some words to say publicly and in this place about people who, I assert, are using our judicial process, after they have been through the administrative process, to delay their departure from Australia. The reason the non-compellable ministerial review is contained in this bill is to block out those continual delaying tactics that some people have already engaged in, to the detriment of the people who are currently held in detention in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was happy to quote Dr Mary Crock earlier in my comments, who said that advocates&mdash;and she certainly is one who has been critical of government and government action on boat people&mdash;take the view that we have a very good system in place. There is another advocate who also commented on the circumstances which led to the presentation of this bill in the chamber. I am referring to the president of the ACT Indochina Refugee Association, who is well known outside of Canberra&mdash;she is not just known in Canberra&mdash;as a very strident advocate of refugee issues. This year she was so respected by her peers that during Refugee Week she was awarded the coveted Paul Cullen Award for services to refugees in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short has picked who it is already. I am referring to Ms Marion Le. She has been an outspoken critic of the government on just about everything to do with refugees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on this occasion she was one of the first advocates to enter into the debate over what should be done concerning those screened out asylum seekers who arrived from the CPA camp of Galang. Ms Le was far from critical on this occasion. She started pushing the government right from the beginning. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 13 July, Ms Le called on the government to remove from Australia the newly arrived refugees from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS>. Ms Le said that it was crucial Australia take a tough stand on this group, given that they had already been found not to qualify as refugees in Galang. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we were to allow them to seek refugee status we'd have a problem with Indonesia&mdash;and with the whole international community.</PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly, she also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that I am a refugee advocate doesn't mean I assist every Tom, Dick and Harry. By definition I'm interested in people who have genuine claims to refugee status. Everyone else should be sent back.</PARA>
<PARA>She also said that she believed the refugee assessment process in Indonesia, supervised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, was as good as, if not better than, Australia's system. I will not comment on whether Indonesia's system or any country's system in the region is better than Australia's; but the system has worked and worked quite well so far in the sense that the CPA plan has put 112,000 refugees through the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the system is flawed, as some of the advocates put in evidence to the committee, it brings into doubt the refugee status granted to some of those 112,000 refugees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to touch on what the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) proposes to do. It proposes amendments to the Migration Act 1958. It inserts into the principal act new sections 91A to 91F and refers to the comprehensive plan of action, popularly known as the CPA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I continue, I should touch on the CPA. The genesis of that plan lies in the exodus of Vietnamese refugees from Vietnam following the fall of Saigon in April 1975. There really were not many avenues of departure from Vietnam other than taking to the ocean, and so the refugees became known as boat people. The outflow of these people in the region has increased dramatically over the years and during the 1980s was the subject of a good deal of concern in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the matter came to a head and the CPA was perhaps born out of a frustration over how to handle the situation. The region, as it were, was put under intense pressure. In particular, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand felt the pressure of the refugees. That was due to the geographical proximity of these countries to the problems that were being experienced by the refugees and the people of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system introduced by the CPA did not substantively label those leaving as economic migrants; but, due to the introduction of an objective standard in determining who would be resettled, it had this effect. There was a perception that the previous agreements had contributed to the problem by encouraging people to leave Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is one of great significance to Australia. We have a situation where refugees might go to one country in the region, be refused that refugee status, and then come to Australia again. This has become known as forum shopping. It was thought that if refugees went to a third country, applied and were processed in an appropriate manner, they really should not have two bites of the apple and come to Australia, tie up proceedings here and take up positions that could be occupied by other more deserving cases. That seems to be the background to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the committee which took evidence in relation to this matter and a number of concerns were expressed in relation to the legislation. It would be fair to say, though, that the greatest concern was in relation to the term `safe third country', which is provided for in proposed section 91D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term relates to a principle whereby the government gazettes a safe third country; if refugees have passed through that safe third country, whether or not they have applied for asylum status, before they get to Australia, they can be refused any application made here and sent back. The minister has discretion, of course, but that really is not appealable, and a good deal of concern was expressed about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that one can go only so far in these matters. Australia has to look realistically at how it lives up to its international obligations. During the course of the hearing I was impressed by Mr Fontaine, the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. The amendments proposed by Senator Short entail, in the main, the suggestions made by Mr Fontaine. In the submission he made to the committee, Mr Fontaine stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, we would like to recommend that the following be further added to section 91D(3) as part of the statement to be laid out by the Minister before the House of Parliament, after subsections (a) and (b):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(c) the willingness of a safe third country to accept returned asylum-seekers and refugees;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the willingness of a safe third country to allow asylum-seekers to remain while their claims are examined and to allow refugees to remain until a durable solution is found; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) whether the non-citizen has strong links to Australia or other compelling humanitarian reasons for the person not to be returned to the safe third country."</PARA>
<PARA>Those sentiments are borne out by Senator Short's proposed amendment, which would go some way towards alleviating the concerns about a safe third country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that various witnesses had was the question of the standards that a safe third country had to meet. Australia can pride itself on a judicial system which is second to none. Senator McKiernan has mentioned Dr Crock's submission that this country has a good record on refugees. Certainly, this country has provided refugees with assistance to take action where there has been a breach in the due process of the Migration Act or where a legal remedy is available. Not many countries afford that. We have provided assistance by way of process and representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has muddied the waters in Australia over the years is a good deal of confusion over the legislation. Previous legislation put forward by the government has demonstrated that the department has not had a crystallised view of its obligations, to say the least. But at the end of the day Australia has set out to do the right thing and meet its international obligations. The CPA is an agreement via the international community which has endeavoured to settle a pressing matter in the region. Therefore, Australia's participation is quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the process which is available to refugees landing on our shores. It may well be that other countries do not have the standards that we would like to see: they might not offer due process; they might not offer the individual the ability to have his or her case for asylum status adequately heard. That is where the problem arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment sought by Senator Short goes to the scrutiny allowed by the parliament of what is laid before it. Subsection C mirrors the comments made by Mr Fontaine. More important, however, is the addition which states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)calls on the Government to strongly request the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to re-examine and evaluate its mechanism for reviewing claims of boatpeople seeking asylum, to better identify those who may have been erroneously processed; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)resolves that there be laid on the Table of the Senate, by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs, by not later than 1 February 1995, a report setting out details of:  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii)the Commissioner's examination and evaluation of the mechanism for reviewing such claims; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv)the Minister's response to the Commissioner's examination and evaluation.".</PARA>
<PARA>That provides some sort of assurance that process will be followed. If there were any breach of that, a return to order there could well be an appropriate measure, and Senator Short has touched on that. That may well allay some of the fears of the witnesses who appeared before the committee about the whole system of the safe third country and questions of the processing of boat people in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a principle of non-refoulement contained in article 33 of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees. Basically, that principle says that a signatory may not send a refugee back to his or her country of origin or any other country where his or her life or freedom would be in danger. Australia should not breach that basic principle, and I do not believe that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not entirely at ease with other aspects of this legislation. The government has accounted for the retrospective aspect on the basis that a press statement was made by the minister prior to the date from which this legislation will have effect. I sound a word of caution to the Senate. Retrospectivity by press release is a practice that should be looked at with a good deal of caution. It is not a practice that should be abused or become commonplace. It should be used sparingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short's amendments go a long way to sorting out this bill and providing some sort of assurance to those who appeared before the committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994 continues the well-worn theme of government policy trying to turn its back on people in our region who are or might be in need of this country's protection. The bill is part of the ever-growing tradition of responding to small groups of asylum seekers with big stick legislation. As an aside, I mention that we will be seeing more of the same during this session when the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which declares that what was illegal is now legal in relation to the boat people detainees, comes back into this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that this chamber has had an opportunity to put paid to the government's shameful treatment of the so-called boat people, and it seems that it will not be the last. But I wonder how many people have closely followed the developments in refugee policy since the first of the recent boats arrived in 1989. Those who have would be amazed by the difference between the response of this government and that of the Fraser government when the much larger influx of boat people started to arrive in the aftermath of the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latter case, the government, led by the Prime Minister and the minister for immigration, worked hard to create a climate of welcome in the community for those who came needing our help. The current government has also worked hard to shape community attitudes&mdash;unfortunately, in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The naming of the latest boat to arrive is, I hope, merely an aberration and not part of the process of vilification. For those who have missed it, the boat has been given the name <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS>, which allows those on it to be referred to as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> applicants. This looks fine on paper when we can see the capital V but could be badly misconstrued through the electronic media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been spectacularly successful with its campaign. I am sure that many honourable senators receive, as I do, phone calls from people in the community who begrudge the boat people anything at all. But the government is seeking to take its response one step further with this bill. At the very heart of this proposed legislation is an attempt to unload onto other countries the whole problem of dealing with certain asylum seekers in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that I understand the government's dilemma with regard to the comprehensive plan of action, the CPA. No-one wants to undermine the plan because at the moment it is all we have in relation to the vast numbers of people who have fled Vietnam or Laos and who are now in camps scattered throughout the region. But it is one thing to say that the plan is all we have; it is quite another to suggest that it is perfect or even that its administration is effective and uniform across signatory countries. If it were so, we would expect the proportion of positive refugee application outcomes to be roughly uniform wherever the applications are assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the outcomes are not uniform, not even remotely so. In the Philippines, 47 per cent of applications are assessed positively. In Thailand the figure is 20 per cent. In Hong Kong it is only eight per cent. That is hardly what one would expect when the numbers involved are as large as is presently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine this bill carefully from a human rights or social justice perspective, we quickly come to the realisation that there are competing forces at work. On the one hand, the bill seeks to uphold the CPA and, as I have said, that is a worthwhile goal. But on the other hand, with this legislation, that goal is at odds with the goal of protecting the human rights of the individuals whose presence has led to the formulation of the CPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the refugee convention was brought into being in 1951 it was a response to an immense human tragedy, a situation in which millions of people were in need of the protection of countries other than their own. The convention ensured that each case would be assessed individually, according to the needs of and the dangers facing the individual. I am not sure that the CPA gives the same rigorous attention to the individual as the convention does, but I am sure that this bill does not consider the wellbeing of the individual to be the paramount issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the convention, Australia is required to ensure that it never returns a person to a situation of danger. We are not allowed a margin of error; we are simply not to do it. With this bill, the government is trying to off-load that responsibility onto third countries. That is the effect of it. Moreover, the attempt to deny people the right to apply for protection is clearly in breach of article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights unless Australia is absolutely satisfied that a decision made about a person's application in another country was fair and proper. I am sure that honourable senators would appreciate just how difficult it would be for us to achieve a process by which we could monitor those processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, if we have returned someone, to Indonesia, for instance, on the grounds that his or her application for refugee status has been properly and fairly assessed and that person is subsequently returned to a situation of persecution and danger, it would be legal mumbo jumbo to suggest that we have not been guilty of refoulement. The fact that three of the 17 people aboard the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS> have been accepted as refugees in Australia bears out that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Pierre-Michel Fontaine, made a submission to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I believe that some of my colleagues have already referred to that. The second paragraph of that submission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In exceptional circumstances, UNHCR has exercised its mandate to grant refugee status where persons have been rejected on appeal. In effect, the UNHCR mandate acts as a "safety net" to ensure that all those who meet the criteria of the UNHCR Statute qualify for the protection of UNHCR. These persons are referred to as "mandate refugees."</PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well but in the case of the people from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vagabond</EMPHASIS>, if they had arrived subject to the conditions being put in place by this bill, they would have been returned to Indonesia or sent on to Vietnam. That is why we are concerned that this so-called safety net will not operate once we have a legislative face that says that we actually send people on and that we do not reconsider their claims. That would mean that those three people out of 17 would not have received the consideration that has allowed them, for the right reasons, to stay in this country because of their refugee status. Paragraph 9 of the submission to which I earlier referred says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, there may be circumstances where a person who once had the protection of a country, no longer does so and is required to leave that country for another country of asylum. This is another reason why past entry or residence is less important than the potential for future protection.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill actually denies people future protection in view of their past entry or residence because, in effect, it says that we can send them back if they have been in another country. That is why, notwithstanding the UNHCR's assessment that, despite its limitations and providing there are safeguards, this bill may well be worthy of support, the Greens are not convinced that we should be supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, that is not the only reason for arguing against the proposed legislation. The administration of the CPA has been criticised, not only for inconsistency but also for perceived levels of corruption in various countries in the region. I understand that this is a matter that concerns the opposition and the Democrats in relation to this bill, and that the opposition is seeking assurances from the government that allegations made against certain countries will be looked into. I am of the view that, at the very least, the bill should be delayed until such time as the reports which are currently circulating are thoroughly investigated. I might add that I wrote to the minister recently about this matter and I will be interested to hear his comments in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also attempts to enshrine in the Migration Act the notion of a safe third country, but we should examine that concept a little more fully. I note that the bill is carefully worded in proposed section 91D(3) (b) to refer to `relevant' human rights standards rather than suggest that safe third countries are distinguishable by absolute human rights standards. I think that there should be some kind of provision for countries in this area to be signatories to the refugee convention and the other international conventions, such as the ICCPR and the human rights convention, that provide human rights protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Canada enacted such a provision in 1989 and so far has not been able to find a country with which it is prepared to sign a safe third country agreement because it cannot find countries with acceptable human rights standards. One cannot help but wonder whether, firstly, this provision would ever be used or, secondly, the government intends to limit the definition of relevant human rights standards to such an extent that any agreements will be meaningless in terms of protecting asylum seekers. I do not believe that this concern about the legislation is simply alleviated by the fact that safe third country agreements will be disallowable in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to draw the attention of honourable senators to the provision in section 91D(2)(a), which allows for a person to be returned to another country if he or she has previously been `present in the country at a particular time or at any time during a particular period'. I referred to that earlier in the submission from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I am referring to those asylum seekers who are currently in detention camps. If this obscure Australian legal definition is what is meant in the bill, it gives me some little bit of hope for the proposed system. If, however, it is the plain English meaning of `present in the country', that could mean that any people on a boat which stops in Indonesia on its way to Australia could be sent back under this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to make a point about the government's readiness to reach for retrospective legislation when it comes to asylum seekers. We have witnessed this time and again, and always found it wanting. In this case, the first boat to arrive from Galang, with people on board who had been rejected under the Indonesian administration of the CPA, is considered under the old rules. But, of course, the government wanted to nip such approaches in the bud and quickly announced that it would legislate at the first opportunity. This bill picks up the intention of that announcement and is, according to the government, quite reasonably effective from the time of the announcement. That might be a reason for considering act No. 4 before act No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the second boat is caught up by the new provisions. I know that in the past&mdash;most recently in the discussion on the treatment of shares held by pensioners&mdash;the government has argued that people should be aware of announcements and act accordingly. But in this case it begs the question of how a group of people in Galang, or already on a boat on their way to Australia, are supposed to hear about the Australian government's press releases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its heart, this bill attempts to make the refugee convention a lesser document and its obligations less important than the comprehensive plan of action. That is unacceptable. The bill creates a legislative means by which Australia can breach longstanding obligations under international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, it is not in anyone's interests to undermine the CPA. But this bill does not deal adequately with the situation of the individuals whose presence in our region brought about the plan. I urge the government to withdraw the bill and rethink its approaches to the issues raised in this debate. While we will be supporting the amendments put forward by the opposition with the view that they may ameliorate some of the concerns, we do not feel they adequately deal with them and, therefore, we will be opposing the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up the second reading of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994, I thank honourable senators for their contributions. Even those who wished it something other than a speedy passage I thank for their thoughtful and considered contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will respond to the major points raised by honourable senators in the debate. Firstly, Senator Short sought an assurance that all potential asylum seekers arriving in Australia would be interviewed by officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. All persons arriving in those circumstances, such as unauthorised boat arrivals, are interviewed by officers of the department on arrival. That has always happened in the past and I can give an assurance on behalf of the minister that it will always happen in the future. The purpose of such interviews is to establish the person's identity and circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill is enacted and persons arrive who are subject to its provisions, we envisage that they would ordinarily be returned to the safe third country or CPA country. However, if issues of public interest arise, such as where there are strong compassionate or humanitarian grounds, the minister could consider allowing the person to apply for a visa. The starting point for whether the minister should consider exercising his non-compellable discretion to allow an application based upon an assessment of whether a person is advancing cogent reasons will be available through the routine initial departmental interview. The minister's non-compellable power is an important safeguard and will be exercised accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In going to the next point of principal concern, I will deal with some of the issues that might normally be stated in the committee stage but it might be easier to do it now. The opposition indicated to the government that it intended to support some of the UNHCR's recommendations regarding section 91D(3) concerning the minister's obligation to table a statement regarding the type of countries that will become safe third countries by way of regulation. Consequently, the government is seeking minor amendments to proposed subsection 91D(3). The proposed subsection relates to the obligation on the minister to lay a statement before parliament providing relevant information about all of the countries prescribed as a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some numbering and lettering changes. There is only a slight variation to the wording relating to those. Proposed paragraph 91D(3)(c) introduces an additional requirement to that proposed originally in the bill. It requires that the statement of the minister must also refer to the willingness of the country or each of the countries prescribed as an STC to allow any person in relation to whom the country is prescribed to go to and to remain in the country while any claim for asylum by the person is being determined. It also provides that, where the person is determined to be a refugee while in the country, the statement should contain information about the willingness of the country to allow the person to remain until a durable solution relating to the permanent settlement of the person is found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is firmly of the view that the words in proposed paragraph 91D(3)(a), namely, `compliance. . . with relevant international law concerning the protection of persons seeking asylum', include the fundamental concept of non-refoulement. Non-refoulement means that there must not be the non-voluntary return of a refugee to a country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Article 33 of the refugees convention prohibits refoulement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler sought an assurance that the words `public interest' in proposed section 91F incorporate `strong compassionate or humanitarian circumstances'. The non-compellable discretion is there to provide the minister with the power to act when the circumstances of a case are such as to merit his intervention in the public interest, which would include when there are strong compassionate or humanitarian reasons. The powers involved provide for a safety net to ensure that no person will be disadvantaged by the statutory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler also raised some concern about the retrospective nature of the amendments. The amendments effectively cover persons who have arrived in Australia on or after 1 September 1994. This gives effect to an announcement by the minister on 29 August 1994. The government's view is that the proposed commencement date is entirely appropriate, given the minister's earlier announcement. The proposed amendments are necessary to maintain the integrity of Australia's borders and the efficiency of the refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her most recent contribution, Senator Chamarette  suggested that the bill contravenes our obligations under international law, including the 1951 refugee convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am advised that the bill was drafted in close consultation with the Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department, which advises that it is consistent with our obligations under international law. The bill was also discussed with the UNHCR prior to its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the amendment proposed by Senator Short. Honourable senators would be surprised to know that the government opposes that proposed amendment! Effective review mechanisms are in place for persons covered by the comprehensive plan of action. In the case of Galang, these mechanisms are as follows. Firstly, applicants are first interviewed by a legal consultant appointed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees who makes a recommendation to the Indonesian screening team. The UNHCR has observer capacity on the screening team. Secondly, if the screening decision is negative, the UNHCR provides, on request, legal counselling on preparation of a review application. Thirdly, the UNHCR is represented on the review committee. Finally if, after the process, the UNHCR considers a screened out person to be a refugee, it can exercise its mandate and declare the person a refugee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNHCR has given an unequivocal assurance that under the CPA no person it considered to be a refugee has been denied refugee status. Asylum seekers can seek redress through either the Indonesian authorities or the UNHCR. In June 1994 at the CPA technical meeting in Bangkok, the UNHCR gave an assurance that it would arrange the re-examination of the case of any person who was able to bring forward new information or changed circumstances relevant to his or her claim for refugee status. Cases which have been brought to the Australian government's attention, claiming that screening decisions were incorrect, have been referred to the UNHCR for re-examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The screening process under the CPA has been finalised. No party to the CPA would want to encourage a massive re-screening exercise. To do so would be costly at a time when there are more pressing humanitarian situations around the world. It would raise unrealistic expectations about resettlement in the camp populations. It would discourage those screened out from voluntarily returning to Vietnam, and it may encourage further outflows from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I will refer to the communications between the government and the UNHCR. This might be relevant to the concerns that motivated Senator Short to move the amendment. Allegations made in October 1993 were referred to the UNHCR on 11 November 1993. On 18 November, the UNHCR advised that the allegations had been referred to its office in Jakarta. Further allegations were made in mid-1994. They were raised by Australia at the CPA technical meeting in Bangkok in June 1994, and UNHCR headquarters agreed to investigate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1994, a report covering the allegations was referred to the UNHCR representative in Canberra. The UNHCR has advised that no person deserving refugee status has been denied that status through not engaging in corrupt practices. The UNHCR is continuing its investigation. With those responses to the principal contributions made in the second reading debate, the queries raised by some senators and the proposed amendment, I wish the bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

That is a good example because, as was probably mentioned in the second reading debate, all of the 17 Vietnamese refugees were denied refugee status by Indonesia, but three of them subsequently succeeded here.

That is our experience, as an international citizen, of the way in which we and other countries operate, in which other countries expect us to operate, and in which we are entitled to expect others to operate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I be equally brief in response. The government's concern with this amendment is that to require that a person have been both in a country as well as having the right to enter and reside in a country would be too limiting and inflexible. The crucial point is the agreement: a safe third country may agree to take back a person who was merely present in that country during a particular period. On the other hand, it may require a stronger link. The circumstances will vary between countries. I would have thought the committee would be keen to have flexibility in these circumstances. The government certainly thinks that such flexibility is required, and we will not be supporting the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to confess that the committee is not going to hear an overwhelming argument. We have a subjective assessment before us. There is nothing inherent in having three years or two years. The government's distinct preference is for three. I will rephrase it and we will vote against the amendment, but it is not a matter of such passion that we will call for a division. The key point was made by Senator Short and I accept the manner in which he made it. It is always open to the government to initiate a change at an earlier period than three years. That is not saying that we cannot change it in less than three years; it is simply the proposed outer limit&mdash;in effect, the sunset clause on a regulation. We think that as the outer limit it is quite reasonable. If it were a minimum, it would probably be too much. But there is flexibility and that flexibility will be exercised.</PARA></TALK.START>

This overlaps a bit with the discussion we will have on the next amendment. Although I do not agree with the amendment, I will certainly be giving some assurances about the flexibility with which we will respond to changed circumstances. I would have thought that those two things together were a satisfactory package.

But including that clause would not in any way give more debating capacity to the Senate to pursue its interests in this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also highlighted the generally undisputed fact that Australia Post is a high performing utility and that the push coming from some quarters for full deregulation is a poor reward for the staff who have lifted their productivity so much. In our view, the public would not gain a great deal, and in many cases they would lose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Australians in rural and remote Australia stand to lose even under the partial deregulation provided for in this bill. The problems that exist in Australia Post's service&mdash;for example, the low number of deliveries to some remote areas&mdash;cannot be solved by competition. To the contrary, increased competition will reduce Australia Post's ability to fund the increased level of service recommended by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the push for deregulation will not stop with the passage of this bill. One does not have to be Nostradamus to realise that Australia Post's reserved services will be further cut back as time goes on&mdash;particularly if the coalition ever wins office. This will put more pressure on Australia Post to cut services to remote and rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Democrats believe that this decline must be stopped and reversed, and the best way to do it is to set minimum performance standards to be met by Australia Post&mdash;particularly in unprofitable rural and remote communities which will not reap the benefits of competition. We will be moving an amendment which would allow the minister to set performance standards by regulation. Australia Post's performance against those standards would be measured by the Auditor-General and reported to parliament. Where Australia Post underperforms, it would have to develop service improvement plans to rectify the problems. Those plans would also be tabled. We believe that this scheme would provide a useful framework for the periodic review of remote and rural services which the minister has announced will be conducted by the House of Representatives Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern has been expressed that our amendment pre-empts the committee's work, but this is entirely unfounded. This proposal would leave the minister free to consider the recommendations of the first committee review before drafting the regulations&mdash;surely a sensible provision. We are strongly of the view that our scheme provides an excellent framework by which services to remote and rural communities can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has plans to move an amendment which would require Australia Post to provide communities which receive roadside deliveries with at least two deliveries per week. As I said yesterday, we understand the aim of this amendment. However, we are concerned that the way it is drafted could actually reduce services to some communities to which twice-weekly deliveries are not feasible. It also could prevent communities that now receive no mail deliveries from getting a roadside service&mdash;again because a twice-weekly service was not feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the best way to handle roadside deliveries is for the minister to set an appropriate performance standard following the committee review which I mentioned before. It must be said that there is an irony in the opposition's professed concern to improve services to rural and remote areas while, at the same time, it proposes amendments which, we believe, would cut further into Australia Post's reserved services. Those amendments are guaranteed to reduce Australia Post's capacity to fund its community service obligations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we, too, understand private sector concerns that the bill places artificial restrictions on competition, the fact is that the funding of community service obligations requires that a line be drawn somewhere. Wherever it is drawn, there will be pressure to push it back. We believe that is what the opposition's amendments try to do. Because we believe this bill exposes more than enough reserved services to competition, we will not be supporting further moves in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are not convinced that there is a significant public benefit in the further deregulation of postal services, as proposed by this bill. In our view, the efficiency gains of increased competition will be minor, but the decline in services to rural and remote parts of Australia could be very significant. On the other hand, the Democrats believe as a matter of principle that those postal services which are now open to competition should remain so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received representations from some firms in the direct mail industry suggesting that competition for the delivery of catalogues and leaflets will be more restricted by this bill than by the present act. We have held a number of discussions with the minister's office and the department on this question, and we believe they now understand our concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires that, if a direct mail company wants to wrap a catalogue or leaflet and address it to a particular person, it can now use only plastic wrapping and not paper envelopes. This raises two concerns. Firstly, the act, as it stands, allows envelopes to be used and to take away that right seems unreasonable and contradictory. Secondly, the use of recycled paper instead of plastic would be prohibited, even  though paper is an environmentally preferable alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments which have been put in favour of this new restriction are that it reserves part of the catalogue and leaflet market to Australia Post and that it allows the contents of private advertising mail-outs to be scrutinised to see whether they are legitimate exceptions to Australia Post's reserved services. We do not accept those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For one thing, a service which is now open should not be withdrawn from competition; and it is not clear to us that plastic wrapping will greatly assist enforcement. An addressed letter can easily be concealed by folding it or placing it inside the catalogue or leaflet. The fact is that Australia Post's best protection against illegal competition is its own employees, who, like the rest of us, receive advertising material in their letterboxes. We will be moving an amendment which clarifies the existing situation; namely, that catalogues and leaflets can be enclosed in addressed paper envelopes for delivery by direct mail firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post is understandably concerned that the definition of the word `leaflet' should not be stretched to include form letters. We agree with that view. There is a potential grey area between the definitions of a letter and a leaflet. But that grey area is not created by my amendment; it already exists in the act and the bill. Ultimately, it is up to the Federal Court to clarify the distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' final concern about this legislation is the summary power it confers on Australia Post's employees to destroy physically offensive mail articles. This seems to be an unjustifiably broad and unaccountable power. At the very least, the details of the article should be recorded before it is destroyed and the sender or addressee should be notified. We will be moving an amendment to that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my speech, this bill is a solution to a non-existent problem. It has the potential to further undermine postal services to remote and rural areas, and our top priority is to prevent that from happening. We would see little benefit in the legislation if our amendment on performance standards was defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the opening of the Constitutional Centenary Conference in June last year, Ms Matilda House, the chair of the Ngunnawal Local Aboriginal Council said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The honour of Australia lies not only in negotiating a treaty with the indigenous people of the nation but also in recognising the civil, political and human rights of a people whose physical possession and sovereign rights over their country were violated. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994, which creates an indigenous land fund, reflects on the honour of this nation in the way the native title legislation did. Indeed, our complete response to the High Court's Mabo decision is about an honest acknowledgment of the past and a bold commitment to a fairer future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year's native title legislation was part of the first and fundamental stage in the process of reconciliation. The creation of an indigenous land fund represents the next stage in meeting honourably our responsibilities as a nation. It goes to the very heart of the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard that there can be no reconciliation without justice. The Australian Democrats think that part of this justice requires an awareness by the entire Australian community of the historical, cultural, social and political significance of land and sea to indigenous people. This bill is about land. In making that point I explain that land for indigenous people means the whole environment: the lands, the water, the sea, the air, the flora and the fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's key issues paper `Understanding Country' helps to explain why and in what ways the land and sea are significant features of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies. Indigenous people have a holistic view of land and sea; it is central to their heritage, their identity and their economic future. The historical fact is that we took that land from them. In the case of Torres Strait Islanders we are reminded of the particular significance not only of land but also of the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we all recall, for one reason or another, the passage of the Native Title Act 1993. It was historic. Most of us believed it was about honour and integrity. That act established a land fund for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. Underlying the creation of that indigenous land fund is the recognition of those people who have been dispossessed of their land and are unable to claim native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us this evening creates a new indigenous land fund under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The fund will be enshrined in legislation, not regulation. One important feature of this land fund, unlike the one created in the Native Title Act, is that it allows money to be spent on land management on indigenous held land, not just those properties acquired under the fund. That is an important proposal. According to the chairperson of the United Nations working group on indigenous populations, Professor Erica-Irene Daes, there is a need for recognition of `indigenous people's right to own, control and use their lands and territories as well as recognition of their land tenure systems and institutions for the management of resources'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are committed to the provisions in this bill, which encourage self-sufficiency, environmental protection and sound land management. I do not think we can afford to overlook the significance and the importance of sustainable development of indigenous held land. The bill also encourages the use of Aboriginal labour, goods and services in undertaking these activities; a feature we are also committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that the principle of the right to self-determination must also be reflected in this bill&mdash;whether we are talking about the use of Aboriginal and Islander goods or allowing the Indigenous Land Corporation the flexibility to determine its strategies. Some of the changes suggested by the opposition deny the right of self-determination. I speak specifically of allowing the parliament to interfere unnecessarily to stall the implementation of a national strategy and to stop the purchase of land in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals have said that, in the granting of land, the ILC must have regard to that grant's improving the health, housing and education of Aboriginal and Islander people. We are talking about land being granted. We cannot and should not attach what should be citizenship rights&mdash;basic rights to basic services such as housing, education and health&mdash;as conditions to the acquisition and management of land. The principle should be of equity. Other citizens have a right to expect such citizenship rights; so, too, should indigenous Australians. We should not have to trade it off for the acquisition of land. We should not prescribe different sets of conditions and standards for indigenous communities from those which apply to the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is not about welfare; it is about rights. Nor is the social justice package a welfare measure. It will address outstanding issues such as education, housing and health&mdash;issues that we all agree need urgent attention. But let us not forget what this legislation is about. It is about land: its connection and spiritual relationship for Aboriginal people. For too long, in my view, we have failed to understand or we have undermined the significance of this relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody denies the urgent and desperate need for attention to matters such as Aboriginal health, which the opposition has pointed out. Many of us, including the Democrats, have made realistic suggestions about funding increases. We have done this after negotiation and consultation with different indigenous communities. Unfortunately, it has proven a very difficult area. It has taken this government and other governments a long time to act on the matter. My personal view is that we have not yet put in place the most appropriate structure for decision making and program delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not fool ourselves into thinking that land in itself will automatically solve the other problems facing Aboriginal people. We must acknowledge that the dispossession of land is at the centre of disempowerment and oppression of indigenous people in our country. That is what the opposition fails to see. </PARA>

The government claims it can deliver sustainable real returns of four per cent for the fund. I will be asking for convincing evidence of this during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this concern about the sustainable nature of the fund that has prompted us to seek a constructive solution via wider investment powers with no increased risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 is a very important piece of legislation. Let it be clear from the outset that the coalition has a very strong commitment in this area. We very much recognise the extent of Aboriginal deprivation and disadvantage. I am sure most honourable senators in this chamber would at one time or another have travelled in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia and seen at first hand the conditions in which many Aboriginals still live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a regular visitor to the Northern Territory over a number of years, and certainly having travelled fairly extensively through outback Australia, I am very conscious of the need for this parliament to do what it can to assist that cause. But it does not follow that simply providing land necessarily brings about any improvement in the conditions of the indigenous population. Indeed, the experience of Bathurst and Melville islands, where the inhabitants were never dispossessed, is stark testimony to the fact that one does not necessarily end up any better off because one remains on one's own land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, since the enactment of the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory in the mid-1970s, we have not seen a significant improvement for very many of those people, despite the fact that they have had the benefit of that legislation. So let there be no hypocrisy in this argument. The idea that somehow the government can call up land and then pretend that it is solving particular problems is simply misleading those who might be otherwise persuaded. The fact is that the government needs to do a great deal more. It needs to ensure that, in many respects, any acquisition of land is accompanied by a number of other major initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we understood that the concept behind this bill was to assist those Aboriginal people who could not benefit from native title, having been previously dispossessed. Those people are said to constitute the vast proportion of the Aboriginal population&mdash;perhaps 90 to 95 per cent. It is understandable that they should be the ones who ought to be the principal beneficiaries of a land fund; but merely giving them land will not necessarily improve their condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our view that the bill does not address in an adequate way the unacceptable deprivation of Aboriginal people in Australia. If the government is serious about those matters, it will also want to ensure that any acquisition of land is accompanied by specific initiatives to improve such fundamental social indicators as health, education and housing. That is why we have said from the outset that the concept of Aboriginal health is a holistic one which encompasses the special and unique relationship that Aboriginal people have with the land and that, whilst land is important, it is simply no panacea in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the moneys that have been spent over so many years which have been designed to bring about a measurable improvement in the state of the health of the Aboriginal population have, in many respects, not been very successful. So if the government is going down a new path and argues that land will somehow make a significant difference, unless it has regard to those crucial indicators, it will find yet again that it is a blind alley. Therefore, we very much want to hold the government to its original commitment that the fund ought to be available to those who do not otherwise qualify under the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said on behalf of the government that there may well be people who only benefit to a marginal extent, who may have what are called usufructuary rights, or rights of passage and easement over the land, and they should not be excluded. By all means they ought to be taken into account. They may well be those who get last priority after all those who have missed out altogether. But to ignore the distinction completely, as this bill does, is to essentially ignore the very reason for which it was proposed in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to be a fundamental shifting of ground which must give rise to a lot of concern on the part of those who genuinely believe that the purchase of land in certain circumstances can make a measurable difference. If it is going to make that measurable difference for those people who have missed out in the first instance, the legislation ought to reflect that commitment. So our first concern is that the purchase of land ought to be linked to attempts to ensure that other social benefits will flow from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not follow that if people own urban real estate their standard of living will be necessarily any better off. It certainly does not follow that, if they have chronic health conditions and little or no education, by putting roofs over their heads they will improve their standard of living. It will not because there are a range of other factors that have come into play and have caused them to be in that unhealthy state. Therefore, if we simply link the attempt to the purchase of land only, I think we are selling short those  we seek to benefit. So our commitment is very real. We are very anxious to ensure that this legislation makes a significant difference. Therefore, the crucial linkage between health, housing, education and economic independence must be acknowledged if that deprivation is to be meaningfully addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other matters concern us in relation to the bill. But if one just takes, in a sense, a philosophical approach for a moment, a lot of the justification for special legislation designed to assist the Aboriginal people has been on the basis of what is sometimes called self-determination or self-improvement&mdash;giving them responsibility over their own affairs. I think that is a commendable initiative. Just as we often say about small business that people ought to have the right to fail, people can only ever make a significant and permanent improvement in their own conditions if they stand on their own two feet as much as possible and are encouraged to make their way in the world without the props of government assistance in the same way that welfare can often be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it can certainly be the case that if people have a paternalistic approach to disadvantage then they will tend to perpetuate it. That is why we take the view that it is very important that land that is made available ought to be made available under conditions that would enable the acquirers to dispose of the land if they believed that to be in their own best interests. After all, the land that they acquire under this legislation is not theirs by virtue of the fact that they have a deep, spiritual attachment to the land. It is theirs by way of a form of compensation. If that is the case, then that compensation ought to be theirs to do with what they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would expect, and certainly hope, that they would have access to very good professional advice and that they would not rush into disposing of land or, indeed, any other possessions without making sure that they were aware of the consequences. Obviously, those monitoring the legislation and those within ATSIC will be taking a close look at how land which is purchased is used in practice. But that is no excuse for saying that, therefore, it needs to be purchased in the name of a corporation; it ought to be inalienable title; and those living on the land should not be able to directly control it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably one of the best ways people can improve their individual well-being is to have their own home. That is why home ownership is at such a high level in this country. Most people recognise that if they have that personal, tangible possession they are well on the way to achieving a degree of income and personal security for themselves and their families. It is a matter for the Aboriginal community to make their own decisions in that regard. No-one is saying that they ought to be forced to own land individually, but it ought to be an option available to them. I suspect that in many instances they would prefer that. People do not share their wives and children. People like their own space. People are more than happy to share communal resources and to interact with their friends and relatives, but that does not mean that they should not be able to own their own possessions. Therefore, I think it is very important that there should be individual acquisition, ownership and responsibility. That is a major amendment that we would like to see made to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters which I think are of particular concern to us. Certainly the composition of the board should be such that there are persons with business or financial skills. We do not have to talk to too many people in the Aboriginal community to realise that they themselves acknowledge the necessity to responsibly handle their own investments. Quite often these days they are required to act as fund managers and to invest substantial sums of money, which have been made available by way of a royalty or otherwise. If people are responsible for a land fund which will have $45 million, or $21 million in the first instance, over a period of time, building up to very substantial sums of money, the very least we ought to have are people on that board with business or financial skills. We also ought to take account of the interests of the states and the state land management systems and, to that extent, have someone on the board who is cognisant of the interest of the states. I think that would make a very valuable difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upgrading of Aboriginal and pastoral properties to be given priority over the acquisition of land in areas where there are already substantial land holdings by Aboriginal people, again, ought to be a matter of commonsense. There is no point in people buying a second piece of land if they cannot maintain the first. If they are not able to make it productive it is simply not in their interests or anyone else's interests to, nonetheless, go ahead and acquire further land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those board members are trustees for the communities and individuals, as they should be, then their interest ought to be not just in the mere acquisition of the land but in ensuring that the land is used in the most productive manner. To do that, people need to ensure that the land is maintained, improved, upgraded, cared for and, if necessary, significant amounts of money should be spent in doing just that. At the end of the day, that is a much more productive use of resources than simply going off and buying more land. People are much better off to have a few improvements on a lesser amount of land&mdash;I can even recall that from my Monopoly days. People are better off to have two or three holdings with a couple of hotels on them than they are to have a whole range of properties where they are getting almost nominal rental. I think the same proposition can be properly applied here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moneys available to ATSIC for the purchase of land should be immediately transferred to the ILC because of the problems within ATSIC's land acquisition and management program. A very good suggestion that I know Senator Campbell has been pursuing diligently is the ability to place a caveat on the title so that the interests of third parties are protected. That system of land management has worked very successfully in state jurisdictions for very many years&mdash;certainly more years than I would like to recall in my time in the law. There is absolutely no reason why the principle could not be applied in this instance. It would be in the interests of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of very important ways in which this legislation can be improved. In the interests of the beneficiaries, I think we have a responsibility to do just that. In many ways the government has already pulled a con trick on the community by pretending that somehow a billion dollars will be made available for land purchase. The reality, of course, is that over a period of 10 years or so we will build up a fund, but the amounts of money that will be available for purchase will be relatively modest&mdash;certainly in the early years. Therefore, it is critically important that the exercise be treated in such a way that we are able to look back on it and say, `Well, that was a successful experiment. That did make a measurable difference.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is simply more money thrown at a festering problem, we can once again expect a community backlash in non-Aboriginal areas because, with the best will in the world, the taxpayer expects to see a return on the investment. In the same way, I think the Aboriginal community itself would like to think that at the end of any period we will be able to say, `This is the benefit that has been derived from that expenditure.' If it is simply the purchase of land without any concern for productivity or for the improvement of the beneficiaries, I do not think we will have a workable piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope very much that the government will reflect on the amendments that will be put forward and that it will operate in the spirit of much better will than we saw on the part of Mr Tickner, who, I think, in the first instance was prepared to reject all of our proposed amendments out of hand, certainly without consulting the Aboriginal community and without in any way having time to take advice from his department&mdash;in other words, playing politics to the hilt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply do not accept the proposition that anyone has a mortgage on compassion, a mortgage on commonsense or a mortgage on concern for disadvantaged sections of the community. Our credentials are impeccable. We have a long history of achievement in government and we are determined to ensure that when legislation is introduced it is in the best interests of those that it purports to assist and is not simply there as a weapon that one political party can use to beat the other around the head with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be looking very carefully to see whether the government is serious about improving this legislation and whether indeed it does consult widely. If it does, it will find that a number of our proposed amendments have very significant support in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land nourished them spiritually as well as materially. In the landscape and the life upon it they saw evidence of the epoch of creation. Down through the generations they passed on laws, customs, traditions and ceremonies reflecting an obligation to care for the land which went to the heart of their society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first European settlers declared that the land had belonged to no-one and the indigenous Australians were shunted aside, often with appalling brutality. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the despair and degradation, conflict and disease, and many of the problems which Aboriginal Australians face today are a consequence of this dispossession.</PARA>
<PARA>I am echoing the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during his address to the nation at the height of the native title debate last year, when he talked so eloquently about the dispossession of Australia's indigenous people. On the introduction of the Native Title Bill on 18 October last year, Mr Keating said that the bill would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . make provision for a land acquisition fund to address the land needs of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose dispossession from their land means they will be unlikely to benefit from the Mabo decision</PARA>
<PARA>And so it did. Now, exactly a year later, I stand in this place and condemn the government for bringing a bill into the Senate which repeals part 10 of the Native Title Act 1993 and replaces it with amendments to the ATSIC Act which are a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on the public record as saying that the bill is unacceptable in its current form, and I would like to reiterate that here and now and explain why. Firstly, the bill fails to live up to the government's promises. Where is the so-called `billion dollar fund' that the Prime Minister keeps talking about? It is a mirage. The fund will never actually leave the Commonwealth Public Account. Only the $45 million a year leaves the tight fists of the Minister for Finance to be available to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders for the purchase of land and the management of that land through the government appointed Indigenous Land Corporation. This represents $124 a year for every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander in Australia. It is a pittance and a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amount will not even come close to meeting the desperate land needs of dispossessed Aboriginal people across Australia. As the Prime Minister pointed out in a media statement on 30 June this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The native title legislation is fundamental to the process of addressing dispossession, and will benefit greatly those people who have been able to maintain a connection with their land sufficient to prove native title. Unfortunately, this will be a very small proportion of Aboriginal people, because the majority have been forced from their traditional lands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Land Fund Bill is to enable indigenous people to acquire land, and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>In a letter to me on the bill last week, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the major financial component of social justice measures arising from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>How dare the Prime Minister speak of a land fund to relieve the land needs of this country's indigenous people and then hand over only a pittance? Why does the Prime Minister not just admit what the government really did?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can such a small amount have been deliberately set to this enormous and valuable task? A few simple calculations tell us that all the government did was double the existing land acquisition funds available to ATSIC and add $3 million for the administrative costs of the ILC. There really is no billion dollar fund. The fund is just a clever sleight of hand, played out by shifting pieces of paper around within the Department of Finance, but the government never has to front up with the actual money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expends $1.49 billion on foreign aid each year. It provides a direct subsidy to mining and agriculture each year of over a billion dollars. The government is setting aside over $20 million a year on the athlete preparation strategy for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. I am sure that most people welcome this expenditure, and no-one would begrudge our fine athletes this valuable expenditure. However, it highlights the inadequacy of the money being provided by the government for the vast number of our indigenous people who have been dispossessed of their land. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, stated during the Finance and Public Administration Committee hearing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can always argue about these quantums, and we would always like to do more, but I think most people have taken the view that this is really a pretty generous response to what is obviously a very major need.</PARA>
<PARA>At least Senator Kernot had the prudence herself to call it a prudent response. I think it is a disgraceful response. It is obviously a very major need which the government is meeting with a totally inadequate amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government finds over $10 billion for the Australian Defence Force each year, or over eight per cent of entire government outlays. Yet the drain on the public account this year in real terms will be only $45 million, that is, 0.04 per cent of total government outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant problem which already faces ATSIC is  that, as the amount of land required to be managed increases, so the amount of funds available to buy land will reduce. It already costs ATSIC around $9 million out of its $21 million just to manage the land it has already bought. Advice we have received points to the fact that ATSIC considered spending over $13 million on management this year but decided it could not afford that amount. The proportion of the funds spent on land management will have to increase as more land is acquired, meaning a diminishing amount will be left to acquire land. It is a bill of diminishing returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, there is no mention of dispossession in the entire legislation. In my letter of reply to the Prime Minister last week, when he stated it was `the' fundamental amount of money they were going to give to this task, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill's operation will once again favour the least dispossessed indigenous people and the most dispossessed will once again be the most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA>It is easy to envisage a time in just a few short years when there is no money left for acquisition because it is all being spent on managing the often economically marginal land which Aboriginal people desire. In simple terms, the Greens (WA) are concerned that the fund will not be sufficient to meet the land ownership needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are concerned that the fund will not be self-sustaining. We believe that the fund is unlikely to provide any degree of historical justice for the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who will not gain anything from the recognition of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving an amendment which would place one per cent of total Commonwealth government revenues in the land fund per annum for 10 years. This follows the example of the one per cent clause that was in the WA constitution. In 1890, when the British handed self-government to Western Australia, there was a clause placed in the constitution to ensure that the new government of Western Australia fulfilled its obligations to protect Aboriginal people. Under the clause, one per cent of total government revenue had to be spent on the indigenous people of Western Australia. The clause disappeared mysteriously in 1904. One per cent of total revenue would see a government contribute about $1.12 billion per annum&mdash;a genuine billion dollar fund. But it is not simply the amount of the fund that exposes the Prime Minister's rhetoric as simply that&mdash;rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a great leap backwards for Aboriginal self-management. Under this bill, Aboriginal people are not respected enough to manage their own affairs. Despite a majority of the board of the ILC being indigenous people, the ILC is still a government bureaucracy and in no way can it be seen as an Aboriginal organisation. All members of the board are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that the ILC needs to be as independent of government as is possible and if it is to address the needs and concerns of Australia's indigenous people, then it must work closely with existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and consult fully when planning its programs. Consequently, we will be moving amendments which ensure that the Indigenous Land Corporation has the highest level of independence from government as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the formulation of national and regional land strategies. However, it does not set out principles or guidelines as to how the ILC will function or how it will distribute its acquisition and management funding. This gives a large amount of power to a central bureaucracy. The bill may satisfy the government's concerns about accountability to the Minister for Finance, but where is the accountability to the Aboriginal community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is a practical impossibility to create an organisation which accurately reflects the diversity of views, needs and desires of all Aboriginal people. In the light of this, the Greens (WA) believe that the ILC's land acquisition and management decisions should be based on the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people as expressed through regional strategies. These regional strategies must be derived from consultation with every Aboriginal community around Australia on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments seek to make the regional strategies have precedence over the national strategy. The national strategy would be constructed on the basis of the regional strategies and the regional strategies would be drawn up, as I said, after full consultation and negotiation with all Aboriginal groups in a given region. The Indigenous Land Corporation board could then base its land acquisition and management decisions on those strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill, the land fund is a trust account within the Commonwealth public account. As such, the fund is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth government. Investment of the money in the land fund is to be made by the Minister for Finance or his delegate within the Department of Finance or ATSIC. We see that the proposed structure of the land fund falls a long way short of the level of self-determination bestowed on the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory by the Fraser government in 1976 in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales parliament passed legislation in the mid 1980s which allowed the New South Wales Land Council to manage a fund which will eventually be worth over $500 million. The New South Wales model allows 7 1/2 per cent of all land tax collected to be available for investment and immediate funding over a 10-year period. It is a much better example both of self-determination and of a self-sustaining fund. It also has a rationale that is not based on what we can afford; it is based on a legitimate percentage of land tax collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that the Indigenous Land Corporation should own and control the land fund. We see it as totally unacceptable that the ILC should be allowed to place any terms and conditions on grants to Aboriginal people. This is the most dangerous clause in the bill because it can be used to manipulate indigenous people. Our amendments would remove the capacity of the ILC to place terms and conditions on the grants and limit its capacity to place terms and conditions on loans and guarantees to repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the land acquisition fund bill the government wants to stop any of the land bought through it from being claimed under the Northern Territory land rights act. As we heard during the hearings of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on this bill, this is to meet Paul Keating's commitment to Marshall Perron. But in order to not lose favour with the two Northern Territory land councils, the government is attempting to divert half the money available for land acquisition over the next three years through ATSIC away from the ILC and thus escape this commitment. The Greens (WA) see no reason why land acquired under this bill should not be claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. If this were the case, then there would be no need for a split of monies between the ILC and ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving amendments to remove the restriction on claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and alter the bill so that, as of the beginning of financial year 1995-96, all land fund monies should be made to the Indigenous Land Corporation and not ATSIC. We will also be moving an amendment to remove the sunset clause from the Northern Territory land rights act. It was the Hawke government which put in that sunset clause in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in 1987, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, in the Hawke government snuck subsection 50(2A) into the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, an outer limit was placed on the processing of claims under that act. There was not a murmur against the move by any of the then senators&mdash;not Labor, Liberal or Democrat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days it would appear that the parties in this place managed to match each other's policy positions on Aboriginal affairs. In fact, until then the Liberals could have rightly claimed a large stake in furthering the Aboriginal cause. As Chris Puplick, a former senator of this place, said in his recent book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Is The Party Over</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is . . . apparent that from at least 1962, through the 1967 referendum, the 1976 land rights legislation, the administration of Chaney and Baume, up until the ATSIC debate, the Liberal Party was rightly regarded as playing a major part in advancing the cause of the indigenous people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>But now at least in rhetoric, the ALP is way out in front. Perhaps this is an opportunity for the opposition to redraw its stand. The rhetoric of the ALP is certainly sounding pretty hollow at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key principles underlying the amendments we will be moving on this bill are: Australia's indigenous people should enjoy the highest level of self-determination possible; they should be treated as equals and enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else in this country; any land returned to them should be handed over free from precondition; and we should take this opportunity to work towards the restoration of a historical justice for our indigenous people. There are many other areas in respect of which we will be moving amendments and I will speak to those during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an extract from the Aboriginal tent embassy press release of today summarising the things we find abhorrent about this bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A meeting at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy discussed the indigenous land acquisition fund and found it to be a paternalistic and racist piece of legislation. It is to be controlled by the Minister for Finance and the Indigenous Land Corporation Board is appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginals question the motivation behind the Land Fund&mdash;That it is purely to appease the international community by appearing to provide one billion dollars compensation for the loss of the land by 95% of indigenous people unaffected by Native Title . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It ignores any Aboriginal Rights to self-government and self-determination and fails to meet the needs and aspirations of people in relation to land and compensation . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government still refuses to relinquish its power and oppression over Aboriginal People.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting also addressed the necessity for the Tent Embassy to remain, as a focus for Aboriginal Sovereign Claim and as a symbol of the living conditions endured by many Aboriginal people across the land. A central desert woman recently commented how `flash' the tent was: `My mob don't live in conditions as good as this.'</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Aboriginal tent embassy is a wonderful witness to the courage and survival of its people. I believe that that tent embassy should remain until all Aboriginal people&mdash;the indigenous people, the first people of this land&mdash;are living in conditions that are certainly far better than what we are seeing. However, it is not money but the principle of justice that we should be seeing at this time. Clarrie Isaacs, a well-known Ngungah, said to me recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can keep your money, we want our land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why don't you use the money in the land fund to compensate the gudya who lose there land when we take it back.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in a sense that is precisely what is happening here except that the non-Aboriginals who lose their land will be doing so voluntarily through a sale. That sale will be provided by the fund. All that it would take to put Clarrie's vision in place is one small compulsory acquisition clause. I wonder how comfortable we would feel if we knew that all there was was $45 million a year to pay all of non-Aboriginal Australia compensation for the loss of the land we should give back. Robert Bropho, who appeared before the committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $45 million is like a grain of sand against Ayres Rock compared with the $164 million that Mr Keating allocated to the farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government can legislate and hand back the reserves that belong to the Aboriginal people. Those were the last bits of land that were set aside in the early days for the Aboriginal people to use. That should be given back&mdash;all crown land. You do not need money; you legislate.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will be waiting forever and a day for land. With the little bit of money that has been allocated towards having this set up, a lot of people will be dying and going to the cemetery. The long continuous wait will go on forever and a day.</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot talk of reconciliation without the restoration of historical justice. On the government side, there appears to be an inverse proportion of political will to rhetoric. It has adopted the now familiar crash through or crash approach. What does this mean? Is the failure to consult not just Aboriginal people but also parliamentary colleagues the pure arrogance of executive power? Or is it that the government really does not care whether this bill passes or fails? Where is the commitment to Aboriginal people that Mr Keating talked about when, during his historic Redfern speech on 10 December 1992, he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 continues the legislation which was debated in this place almost 12 months ago. I wish to add my words to other words which have been spoken in this place and, by way of introduction, read from the overview which is contained in the explanatory memorandum in part A. The overview, in part, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is part of the Commonwealth's overall response to the High Court's historic Mabo decision and complements the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS>. As most indigenous Australians have been dispossessed of their lands, they have been prevented from meeting the criteria laid down in Mabo which requires a continuing connection with land or waters. This legislation represents a further significant step in reversing the process of dispossession which has been oncoming for over 200 years.</PARA>
<PARA>A little time ago, when this debate began, Senator Sandy Macdonald quoted some words from a poem which, in effect, said that we cannot compensate today for wrongs done long ago. Unfortunately, the wrongs which have been done were not simply done long ago but continue to the present day. There is a myth which seems to be common in the community that somehow or other the roots of this bill and the injustices perpetrated on the Aboriginal people go back 200 years and, therefore, we are not responsible. We often hear people saying that we cannot do anything about something which happened 206 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to place on the record my own experience of a little over 30 years of what has happened in my lifetime in my home state of Queensland; to say that the process of dispossession has been going on right up until the present day. It is not something which happened long ago; it is very much current. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a little history, at least going back to the late 1950s and early 1960s. I will tell honourable senators about a place called Mapoon in North Queensland, which was required by Comalco in order to mine bauxite. At the time, the Presbyterian Church was the administrator of that small community. The Presbyterian Church negotiated with the government and the company but consulted not at all with the Aboriginal people, who refused to shift from the small community at Mapoon. Early one morning in the early 1960s&mdash;I do not have the exact year&mdash;a boatload of police arrived at the community of Mapoon. The people were handcuffed at gun point; the houses, shop and church were burnt to the ground; and the people were scattered to the communities of Weipa South, New Mapoon and Thursday Island. I remember well the moderator of the Presbyterian Church and first moderator of the Uniting Church saying with great emotion that never again would he be part of a church which agreed to that kind of injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take honourable senators to 1975. In 1975 the Aurukun Associates Bill was passed through the Queensland parliament. It was a bill that granted even more land to the mining companies to add to what they had already acquired when they took over Mapoon and established the town of Weipa. The Aurukun Associates Bill, again without any consultation with Aboriginal people, granted further vast tracts of land to the mining company. This bill was challenged in the Supreme Court of Queensland by the Aboriginal people and they won their case there. The Queensland government took the issue to the High Court and again the Aboriginal people won. The Queensland government then appealed to the Privy Council, which was still possible in those days, and the Privy Council overturned the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the High Court of Australia. On a technical legality, it granted the appeal of the Queensland government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aborigines Act of 1971 had given absolute power to the director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to enter into a contract with anyone, including mining companies, with respect to Aboriginal reserve land. The director had no legal obligation to consult with Aborigines or to respect their wishes&mdash;and usually did not. In 1977, the Reverend Gordon Cootes and I, as a delegation from the Uniting Church, approached the director of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, Mr Pat Killoran, and sought from him an assurance that the Uniting Church would be able to continue its work at the communities of Aurukun and Mornington Island. He gave us an absolute assurance that that would happen. However, a few months later, in March 1978, the Queensland government delivered a letter to the Uniting Church, giving it three weeks to quit its ministration of those two communities. I will read again from the overview, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's specific objectives in establishing the Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation are to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a worthy objective. But I will give another little slice of Queensland history, coming closer to the present day, that again shows that this worthy objective, whether or not it is fulfilled by the bill, is at least needed. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a Mr John Koowarta of the Aurukun community sought funding from the Commonwealth government to purchase a pastoral lease at Archer River Bend. The Queensland government opposed his taking over of the pastoral lease and negotiated with Comalco to purchase the lease instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vendor, when he received an offer from Comalco, contacted the Uniting Church and said, `I want to sell to the Aboriginal community at Aurukun because they know this pastoral lease and they have done a good job when they've been working for me.' So he refused to sell to Comalco. The Premier at the time, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, wrote to the Prime Minister and said that he would not allow land rights by the backdoor. So the Racial Discrimination Act was applied, and the Queensland government challenged that act in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took some years before the act was tested. In the meantime, the government changed the pastoral lease to a national park lease. So even if Johnny Koowarta could have obtained justice, it would have been too late. In any case, after some years the Racial Discrimination Act was upheld and Johnny Koowarta's right to purchase the land was upheld. But by this time he had died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline for the Senate some other history which again underlines the fact that we are not talking about injustice 200 years ago. We are talking about injustice which has continued up to the present day. In 1982 the Uniting Church's Commission for World Mission and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, because of the conflict between Aboriginal people and mining companies at Aurukun, Mornington Island and Noonkanbah, commissioned a study into the contact between mining companies and Aboriginal people to help Aboriginal people understand the way in which mining companies were structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study was eventually published as a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aborigines and Mining Companies in North Australia</EMPHASIS>. However, in order to make it more accessible to Aboriginal people, the two church commissions had it published in a comic book form, with tapes in about seven Aboriginal languages and posters, et cetera. The Australian Mining Industry Council sued not the two church commissions but every Uniting Church moderator in every state of Australia, the Uniting Church president as well as every Catholic bishop in Australia. The churches caved in, I am sad to say, and agreed to destroy all the copies of the comic books, the tapes and the posters. This left a vacuum, which I believe allowed the Australian Mining Industry Council to mount a campaign against both the national Aboriginal land rights legislation, which had been promised by Bob Hawke, and also against land rights legislation in Western Australia. </PARA>

Recently in Victoria a group was formed which calls itself `Galatians 3'. I will not go into the reasons behind its choosing that title. Recently this group, Galatians 3, had a conference in Melbourne. It had a number of very well-known speakers, such as Geoffrey Blainey; Dr Stephen Davis from Western Mining; Max Champion and Warren Clarnett, well-known members of the Uniting Church; Dr Ron Brunton and others. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conference there were no Aboriginal speakers. No invitation was given to anyone in the Uniting Church to attend in an official capacity. But some friends of mine from the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace attended the conference.

Winston made a point of telling me that he actually wanted me to incorporate a second reading speech, which I do not have yet. I want to pay tribute to the enormous effort that Winston and Thea put into particularly drafting some of the amendments and assisting us in putting them into some sort of order that would be available, first, for the debate in the House of Representatives and then for the committee stage here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate got off to a very bad start when the coalition put together what I thought was a very positive and constructive approach to a land fund bill. We looked at the legislation the government finally presented to us in June to see whether it matched the rhetoric of the government back in December and found very quickly, as Senator Chamarette and a range of other senators have found, that the bill is indeed a deception of all Australian people, particularly of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, because it fails in a number of regards to match the government's rhetoric during the Mabo debate as to what it would do with the land fund. We set about quite constructively with a range of coalition members and senators who have a specific interest in these affairs, including the two former shadow ministers, Peter Nugent and Michael Wooldridge in the other place, to put together a very constructive package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the contribution of Michael Wooldridge, who has a passionate interest in Aboriginal affairs, at the second reading stage of the bill in the House of Representatives. I saw a very angry man who had put weeks of his life into designing a set of amendments which would constructively reform this flawed piece of legislation. His anger reflected his frustration at knowing that the coalition had put up to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) a range of what we thought were constructive amendments that would empower Aboriginal people and get away from the legacy of an all-powerful bureaucracy controlling much of Aboriginal affairs policy in this country in a paternalistic manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those amendments were rejected out of hand within some four or five minutes, clearly without any consultation with Aboriginal communities. The opposition understands that that out-of-hand rejection of our reforms of this bill was the work of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who basically said, `No, we are not going to deal with the opposition on this. We are not going to discuss their amendments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government finds itself in an interesting position now that the bill is in the Senate and finds a range of amendments which have broad support&mdash;some proposed by the opposition and a raft of amendments proposed by the Greens&mdash;and which all seek to empower Aboriginal people and create a land fund that earnestly seeks to redress some of the very significant problems suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to fall into the trap of traversing the many amendments that will be debated in this place over the coming days. I want to pick on some of the broad aspects of the bill that we think require reform and some of the positive aspects of the reforms proposed by the coalition. Last night, when Senator Cooney was addressing the second reading debate, I noticed that he read the preamble of the ATSIC Act&mdash;and he may well have read the preamble of the Native Title Act. He said, if I quote him correctly, `No-one has attempted to take it out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that one of the fundamental features of the bill before us tonight is that, contrary to what Mr Keating has told the Australian people about the coalition's views on the native title legislation, the first move to make significant changes to the Native Title Act, only 10 months after it was passed through this very chamber late at night, has been made by the government. By effectively abolishing clause 201, the government is abolishing the land fund as it was originally intended under the Native Title Act. The government is also taking a red pen right through the heart of the preamble. I remind the Senate that, in relation to the land fund, the preamble specifically said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>The Finance and Public Administration Committee heard evidence to suggest that the only reason that the land fund is being taken out of the Native Title Act and put into the ATSIC bill is to effectively avoid the direction that the preamble provides to the land fund; that is, to assist those Aboriginals who are unable to assert native title rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember Senator Cheryl Kernot describing the preamble as a splendid preamble which should be incorporated in the constitution. The effect of what this government is doing is to take a red pen and run it through the preamble to the Native Title Act&mdash;a preamble which was regarded as sacrosanct back in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has indicated that she will support this bill with virtually no amendment. So far, we have seen only a package of amendments from the Democrats that seek to change slightly the investment criteria of the fund, but we have seen no significant amendments to any other aspect of the bill. Senator Kernot is giving the bill the green flag and waving it through with virtually no amendments. She is complicit in ripping a knife through what she regarded as a splendid preamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is at the core of a number of the opposition's concerns about this legislation. The legislation in no way seeks to assist those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who are suffering the most disadvantage and who have been most dispossessed. A range of our amendments seeks to address that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the straw man that has been built up by the government, by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, by the Prime Minister, and again tonight by Senator Kernot in saying that this is all about land and that health, housing and education are separate identifiable problems that are in no way associated with land. It is a straw man because the coalition's proposals simply make it a requirement that these important social goals for all Australians&mdash;citizenship rights and birthrights of all Australians, which is not the case for many Australians or for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians&mdash;be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These goals should apply to all land that has been granted to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Senator Panizza reminded me earlier this evening that in Western Australia Aboriginal land made up a total land area equivalent to the combined land area of Victoria and Tasmania. That is a massive amount of land. Most Australians are aware that many Aboriginals suffer significant disadvantage, particularly in the area of health, housing and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has built up this straw man by saying, `The coalition says that unless it can be shown that they have demonstrable improvements in health, housing, education and economic viability, they will not be able to purchase the land.' We do not prescribe a check list of health, housing, education and economic viability before they can make an offer to purchase some land. That is not what is proposed. If the members of the government bothered to turn the cover page of the amendments, they would know that that is not what is proposed. I suggest that Senator Kernot knows that that is not what is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose the quite sensible proposition that some of these areas of disadvantage be taken into consideration when the Indigenous Land Corporation goes out and considers purchasing land. Where there is a choice in the matter, we are proposing that these important social goals for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;goals that all Australians would share&mdash;be taken into consideration when purchasing land. They certainly are not a prerequisite and they never have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have not taken the time to read the coalition's amendments have been building up this straw man and knocking it over. They say the coalition is creating a reason not to support the bill. I put on the record again that the coalition will be supporting this bill as long as it seeks to redress the disadvantage that most Australians know Aboriginal Australians suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette made some very important points about the paternalistic nature of this fund. It is indeed a structure that ensures that the Indigenous Land Corporation maintains an interest and tight control over any land that it grants or any other activities for, as best we can determine, time immemorial. It ensures that virtually anything that goes on on that land requires the approval of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Unless the land granted to Aboriginals is given in good faith, unless they are allowed to develop it in their own way, to have a sense of ownership and to be able to determine for themselves how they use that land, the coalition believes that we are giving them something much less than all other Australians can enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most other Australians can enjoy the right of owning some property in an unencumbered state. This bill creates a mechanism to ensure that if an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person gains a grant of land from the Indigenous Land Corporation, then as a land holder that person will have an encumbrance against their title for the period that they enjoy that property right. That is less than what is enjoyed by other Australians. One of the purposes of the reforms that we seek to make to this bill is to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do enjoy the same rights that all other Australian citizens seek to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other sad and paternalistic approaches this bill takes is to ensure that land can be granted only to corporations. I noted an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, I think it was on 26 August, wherein Noel Pearson, the Chairman of the Cape York Land Council, referred to white structures being imposed on Aboriginal culture. And here we are in this bill imposing an Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Celtic corporate concept on Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been outlined by a number of my colleagues, we seek in our amendments to ensure that the ILC has the flexibility to ensure that land and assistance can be granted not only to a body corporate or a corporation but also to individuals, persons, partnerships and trusts, something that we consider is an important empowerment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians&mdash;again putting them on the same footing as Australians with European heritage and not discriminating against them by saying, `You can hold land only if you are a corporation.' We believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as individuals should have the freedom and the flexibility to hold that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also looked at the problems created by the foundation of two funds. Most Australians, if we stand around at a barbecue or a pub and have a beer and talk about Aboriginal affairs policy with them&mdash;and just about everyone has an opinion on it&mdash;will tell us that there are billions of dollars going into Aboriginal affairs, that it all seems to get sucked up by the bureaucracy in Canberra and that very little of it seems to get down to the cliff face or into the communities to solve the problems that these Aboriginal people suffer. We only need to travel to Kalgoorlie, or Roebourne, or Meekatharra, or Carnarvon, or Broome or Fitzroy Crossing to see the plight of many Aboriginal Australians who really do suffer in comparison to the majority of Australians who enjoy a good living standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average Australian standing around a backyard barbecue or leaning up against the bar at a pub having a beer will tell us that that is the problem. So what does the government do when it sets about redressing some of the disadvantages of Aboriginal people in granting them land? Instead of setting up one bureaucracy to deal with land, it establishes two. This bill clearly establishes the existing administrative and bureaucratic regime of the ATSIC land organisation and then creates a new one called the Indigenous Land Corporation. So for the next three years we have two&mdash;not one&mdash;land administration regimes in Canberra for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, with all of the cost of the administrative and bureaucratic burden that will be met from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every dollar and every cent that will go into the additional expenditure required to run the two bureaucracies will be another dollar and another cent that will not go towards helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to purchase land, to get land management advice or to upgrade existing properties. It is money which will, in the quite proper perception of the average Australian leaning up against the bar, be sucked up by the Canberra bureaucracy and not help one Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters that I wanted to deal with. One of them was raised in the Finance and Public Administration Committee's consideration of this bill. It was  a matter raised by a Northern Territory minister&mdash;I think it was Mr Hatton&mdash;who said that he believed that business principles should apply to all of the decisions of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Mr Dillon, the bureaucrat from the Attorney-General's Department who was left to deal with the committee's hearing during the afternoon, defended the fact that a range of the corporation's activities would not require business principles to apply by saying that, in some cultural and education considerations, business principles should not be required to apply. Again, that is a quite dangerous approach to take when what we are really seeking to do is to assist many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to overcome disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even without a requirement, and even if the corporation is undertaking a non-profit operation or an educational activity, there is nothing to say that we should not apply sound business principles. There are many sound business principles that apply to non-profit organisations and voluntary organisations and those principles should apply. Unless they do apply, the Indigenous Land Corporation will come under the same cloud that many of the operations of ATSIC have come under over the years&mdash;the doubt many people have about the credibility of ATSIC when it comes to handling money and a range of other accountability problems that have been raised from time to time about that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation process in relation to this bill is something that has also been of serious concern to the coalition. We took evidence on the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in relation to that lack of consultation. I sought specific details from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet as to the consultations it made. It is quite clear from the list that it provided to us that the consultations were effectively with the inner sanctum of the Prime Minister, the minister for Aboriginal affairs, and his advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and this Prime Minister seek to consult with those Aboriginal groups which reflect the views of the government and which quite often receive financial benefit from that government. They exclude those who do not agree with their views. Sprinkled through this bill is the same consultation processes. So when it comes to regional strategies there is only one group that is required to be consulted&mdash;the ATSIC regional councillors&mdash;ignoring all the other people who have an interest in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the whole process of the formulation of this bill was flawed. We believe that consultations were not wide enough. We believe that the bill does require reform. We look forward to the committee stage debate of this bill where, we believe, a number of the Green amendments and a number of the coalition amendments will improve this bill. We hope that the government will put an end to its dogmatic and dog in the manger approach to not accepting any of our amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctrine was terra nullius. It was a doctrine that held that prior to European settlement nobody owned the land in this country. It was a doctrine that meant that because Aborigines did not mount a full-scale armed struggle against white settlement they therefore had no property rights to lose. It was a doctrine that said that this land was settled, not invaded, and therefore the existing inhabitants at the time and their descendants had no legitimate claim to having been deprived of their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people today recognise that this doctrine was flawed. In fact, it was really an excuse to legitimise the dispossession of land from its traditional owners and, more importantly, to legitimise that dispossession without compensation being duly paid. Thus the Mabo decision in 1992 was certainly historic. It overturned terra nullius and forced us as a nation, as a people, as a government, to come to terms with the issue of traditional ownership and dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also meant that finally we have had to recognise what the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been saying for so long and what has been largely ignored for so long&mdash;that is, land is of fundamental importance to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to their history, to their culture and to their existence. This relationship with the land was so eloquently expressed by Mick Dodson, of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To fully understand why land rights are so important to indigenous peoples, you have to move out of the paradigm that sees land as purely a commodity to be exploited . . . For us, land has a spiritual, cultural, political and economic value. It supports our identity, our spirit, our social relations, our integrity and our survival. Land is the source of our physical and spiritual sustenance. Removed from our land we are literally removed from ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a mark of our time that non-Aboriginal Australians today are increasingly recognising and appreciating the importance of the relationship that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill is the next stage in the process which began with that historic Mabo decision in 1992. Just as was the case with the Native Title Act, the land fund bill has been brought to fruition after an extensive and exhaustive process of consultation. This extensive consultation has been undertaken by the government not just because it is integral to good legislation but also because it is an inherent part of the overall process of reconciliation. The government did not come to the table with a fait accompli. There was a real determination to consult, to consult widely and to arrive at a consensus position. The various Aboriginal communities, the farmers, the miners, the state governments, the major groups and those who wished to be involved were involved in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame, therefore, that consensus of that nature, such broad-based community support, is not enough for the opposition. The opposition's definition of consensus is really to appease a few reactionary state premiers and other rednecks who have never accepted the Mabo decision. On this most important issue, an issue which goes to our nation's integrity, the opposition has clearly failed. It has abandoned the bipartisan approach that existed in the parliament just prior to the last election. Moreover, its leaders walked away from that bipartisan approach simply to shore up support with the reactionary elements of the coalition parties. Sadly, the decent members of the opposition, those who have in the past taken a reasonable and responsible approach to Aboriginal affairs, have been muzzled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what, then, is the approach of the opposition to the land fund bill? How does it respond to this bill, which is specifically about land, which aims to provide justice and which is directed to those who have been dispossessed but are unable to pursue a successful Mabo-style claim under the Native Title Act? The opposition tries to shift the entire focus of this bill on to other issues. Rather than deal with the actual purpose of the bill, the opposition seeks to negate its fundamental importance by introducing a range of other issues, particularly Aboriginal health, education and housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises the importance of these issues and recognises that things must be done in these areas, but the land fund bill should not be emasculated by trying to broaden its scope, thus undermining its essential purpose. Members of the opposition, indeed all senators, should take note of the editorial in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land fund then is a matter of justice, not welfare. Aborigines are entitled to welfare because of the continuing social and economic disadvantage they experience. They are entitled to the land fund as just compensation for past dispossession and dispersal from their land.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> saying this&mdash;no great friend of the Labor government. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To demand, as the Opposition does, that land purchased under the new fund be used to improve Aboriginal welfare is to confuse these two principles. It is also to deny that Aborigines regard their acquisition of land as a good thing in itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. It was fascinating to listen to Senator Forshaw's contribution because, quite clearly, he has very little understanding of what the bill will do and no understanding whatsoever of the coalition amendments. It would have been quite advantageous if he had bothered to spend a little time prior to his contribution tonight reading the amendments so as to understand their basic thrust. If he did so, he might have realised that the coalition's amendments will benefit Aboriginal Australians, who demand that some of these amendments be agreed to. Be that as it may, as is quite often typical in a situation such as this, the Labor Party is so blinkered by its ideological bent that it cannot take anything outside the four dots into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the federal government thought that its Native Title Act did not go far enough in killing off states' rights in terms of the Aboriginal land rights issue, then this bill will go the rest of the way to finishing off the job. From the 1982 Koowarta case in Queensland to the Mabo case some 10 years later, the issue of Aboriginal affairs, particularly land ownership, has seen a very steady erosion of the states' rights to legislate on land management, which is rightfully their area under the provision of the Australian constitution. Unfortunately, that is an issue that is consistently forgotten by this Labor government. I hope that, sooner or later, the government will recall that the states do have such control over this issue. Ron Castan QC, part-time commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There seems no limit to the kind of laws that may be passed by the Federal Parliament to benefit Aboriginal people. Any federal laws relating to Aborigines will prevail against any conflicting state laws.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment, which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 25 May 1992, is as relevant today as it was then. This legislation makes a lot of promises to Aboriginal people. It will give them the right to claim land in cases where they are unable to demonstrate an ongoing connection with the land and it will provide them with money to acquire and maintain that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main features of this fund is that allegedly it will allow for the investment of fund money in order that the fund will become self-sustaining and that it will provide ongoing economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits to Aboriginal people. The initial funding, which is a substantial amount, will be $200 million in 1994-95 and $121 million indexed for nine years to a total allocation of $1.463 billion over a period of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) describes this as a measure of justice to indigenous Australians, but in the long run it may prove to be little more than a smoke and mirrors illusion with the possibility that responsibility for funding may eventually come crashing down on the state and territory governments. I have heard absolutely no guarantees to the contrary. The minister claims that it is part of the government's efforts to work towards establishing a new relationship between Australia's indigenous people and the wider community&mdash;a relationship in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is protected and valued and a relationship in which indigenous people participate fully in Australian economic life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Panizza said last night, what will throwing money around for land possibly achieve for indigenous people in the areas of health and general living conditions? As I said before, Senator Forshaw made it his business not to read the very substantial amendments that the coalition is putting up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will this bill alleviate the fact that Aborigines have a mortality rate four times greater than the total population; that Aborigines live 15 to 17 years less than the rest of the population; that the Aboriginal infant and peri-natal rates are three times the national rate; and that Aborigines are three times more likely to be hospitalised? Will this bill resolve that? The answer is no, it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will this bill resolve the fact that Aborigines remain 18 times more likely to end up in prison and that just 23 per cent of Aborigines between 15 and 24 attend an educational institution?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contributions that I have heard thus far from the Labor Party have not even attempted to focus on these major problems confronting the Aboriginal communities in Australia today. Quite simply, this bill does not focus on those problems. I do not see any benefits for these areas which could flow on from either the High Court's Mabo decision or this new legislation concerning the land fund or the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the government's policies and measures to address these problems? We have asked repeatedly throughout the Mabo debate and many other debates in this parliament over a number of years, and we ask again in this debate: where are the measures addressed to solve these problems? Why does the government commit $500 million over five years to the health of Australia's 270,000 Aborigines and $1.4 billion to land? That is an appalling contrast. How can this government honestly come into this parliament and go out into the Australian community with that sort of record? The funding for health pales into insignificance by comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, told the Senate that the coalition had expressed opposition to the bill, saying there were higher priorities in Aboriginal affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She said that the opposition should be swayed in the interests of justice and in the cause of righting historical wrongs in the hope that Australia could be delivered into the future without the scars and stigmas of the past.

It shows just scant regard for the major problems confronted by the Australian Aboriginal community today to say that, somehow, giving land will solve these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will never, ever be free from these scars. Like the traditional and ritualistic scarring of the Aboriginal people, we have these scars forever. Just throwing land and money at the Aboriginal people will not heal one single, solitary scar. The only way we can deliver ourselves is to offer indigenous communities better access to all services: health, education, justice, and better standards of living. Just simple things like giving them better shelter and better quality water would be a start. But does this government bother to look at those issues? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 October there were reports on Oombulgurri, a remote Aboriginal community in the Kimberleys, the northernmost region of Western Australia. Oombulgurri covers 500,000 hectares and was formerly an Anglican mission. It is claimed in that report that Oombulgurri is the most poorly resourced community in Western Australia and that the 250 residents live in Third World conditions&mdash;and that is no exaggeration. What is the government doing about it? Nothing! Houses are overflowing with sewage. The rate of infestation from scabies, threadworm, hookworm and trachoma is chronic. Other infections include: gastroenteritis; ear infection; chronic diarrhoea; chest infection; skin infection; and, of course, sexually transmitted diseases. What is the government doing about any of that? Nothing! It is throwing land and money at the problem. It is not resolving a single, major problem affecting Aboriginal communities today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Set in an environment of extreme heat and humidity, with flies galore, the spread of infection is easily facilitated by inadequate housing and hygiene facilities. Is that problem addressed in this bill? No, it is not. The one outdoor sink in Oombulgurri is used by all the residents to wash dishes, prepare food, wash children and do the laundry. Does this government honestly believe that that is an adequate environment in which Aboriginal communities can be expected and demanded to live? I think it is an appalling situation that this bill is before the parliament and none of these considerations are even given the slightest thought in legislative terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics for this community are even more alarming than the national rate. The incidence of diabetes is reported at 25 times the state's average, and life expectancy is at least 20 years below that of non-Aborigines. There are few men over 45 years. Most have died of alcohol-related illness or accidents. Most women over 30 are diabetic and have high blood pressure, and the oldest woman is 67 years of age. </PARA>

Last year the town's two liquor outlets sold 146,000 litres of cask wine, or 90 casks per day, to the town's less than 3,000-strong Aboriginal population. What is this government doing about the problem of alcoholism in Aboriginal  communities? Nothing. There are countless communities like this one and like Oombulgurri. These people would not experience a boom in their standards of living if they suddenly acquired the land they lived on. It is not going to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many times we have to stand in this place or go out among those communities and spell this out, because somehow or another we cannot get the message through to the Labor government that these are the major problems affecting Aboriginal communities.

They need to be taught in order that they can pass on their knowledge to their children as in the times of old. Not only that&mdash;they want to be taught. They want to have these facilities. Is this government delivering them? No, it is not. They need to be able to identify important health issues, including alcoholism, and then to solve the problem. This requires money and a collaborative approach with the states and territories, not one which simply rips the reins from the hands of the state or territory governments. That is what we are seeing repeatedly put into place by this government&mdash;overriding effects over the Aboriginal communities, the states and the territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the July-August edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> of this year, John Hirst, a historian from La Trobe University, described land rights as one of the five fallacies about Aboriginal policy. In his essay, he described land rights as a cure-all and argued that the 20 years experience of land rights in the Northern Territory demonstrated that traditional land ownership did not guarantee that Aborigines could become self-supporting. He attributed the failings to the fact that the land which is guaranteed and/or acquired is usually non-productive and that it is in too remote a location for government assisted projects to be of any real benefit. He described land grants as islands of despair. I think, quite frankly, that is very apt. He said that Canberra can regulate life but it certainly cannot create it. That is equally true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hirst said that it is not so much prejudice that is burdening indigenous people but the flawed assumptions upon which the federal government bases its policies for the indigenous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving land is a populist approach based upon the flawed assumption that land rights is a cure-all. It may go part way to assisting outback Aborigines, but it does not, on the whole, solve the kinds of problems that I have outlined. How ironic it would be if the vast amounts of money being thrown into this fund were to perpetuate the problems in the areas of health and general welfare. It is, therefore, imperative that funding for grants of land is accompanied by a guarantee that indigenous community living standards will be significantly improved. The coalition wants demonstrable benefits, and that is the basis for one of our major amendments. All we ask the government to do is demonstrate that it is prepared to undertake that course of action. Sadly, from the contributions that we have heard so far, that is not going to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to see accountability. It is a real concern that the ILC in its present form lacks the accountability which would ordinarily be required of any department with a large budget. Currently, there is no requirement for the ILC to develop strategies which stand up to scrutiny, although its powers are quite extensive. They include land purchase and transfer, making land grants and guaranteeing loans for the management of land, developing national and regional land strategies and, more generally, making contracts, investing money, accepting gifts, grants and requests and entering into partnerships and joint ventures. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the effect the legislation will have on the pre-existing mechanisms of most of the states and territories for the provision of land for Aboriginal people. As with much of the government's legislation in recent times, this bill sets the scene for unnecessary competition between state and federal land funds. Such an approach lacks coordination and becomes self-defeating in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want grants to be limited to corporations. They should include individuals and trusts, because the consultation process with many of the Aboriginal communities has been simply and utterly inadequate.

Under section 41 of the Western Australian Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is able to grant an indigenous community freehold title to a tract of land on the grounds of Aboriginal advancement. It is not a requirement that traditional usage or native title be proven.

It is difficult for non-Aboriginal Australians to fully appreciate the importance of land and the feeling of dispossession suffered by Aboriginal people. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that dispossession from the land had far-reaching and serious effects on all aspects of Aboriginal people's lives. The commission's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are issues underlying the alienation of Aboriginal people and their continuing conflict with the law which cannot be solved by police and Aboriginal people alone. The key is to be found in the hearts and minds of all Australians. It lies in the recognition of the Aboriginal people as a distinct people, the indigenous people of Australia who were cruelly dispossessed of their land and until recent times denied respect as human beings and the opportunity to re-establish themselves on an equal basis.</PARA>
<PARA>About Aboriginal people who have been removed from their traditional land, the report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding this break from specific traditional attachments to land that some Aboriginal groups in the more remote areas of Australia have been able to maintain, Aboriginal people in the settled areas of Australia have continued to maintain the core elements of their spiritual association with land. This association is an assertion of their Aboriginality. Their loss requires redress that is, in essence, the same, even though the form of redress may vary considerably.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders regard the ownership of land as being fundamental to their wellbeing. The land provides a religious, legal, social and economic code for them. Land defines the identity of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;their spirit, social relations, integrity and survival all come from the land. When they are removed from the land, they are removed from themselves. To quote Galarrwuy Yunupingu:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, Mr Downer. The Liberal and National parties do not see the purchase of land for Aboriginal people as a priority or indeed as appropriate. They resent the implicit recognition of a different culture with different priorities. That is a genuinely held view and they are consistent.

It now says, `Pass our amendments and we will support the legislation.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, I think, best described the opposition's approach in a headline to its story `Fund tack smacks of insincerity'.

<PARA>At first glance the amendments seem innocuous enough, but ATSIC describes those Liberal amendments as `tearing away at the integrity of the bill and the negotiation process which created it'. The Liberal amendments would create pressure for Aboriginal communities to force their needs into artificial criteria and to suppress references to their own cultural criteria. It would thus perpetuate the non-recognition in Australian law of the intrinsic value of indigenous culture in its own right and require the indigenous people themselves to subordinate that culture to the criteria imposed by the bill. It is unconvincing and insincere to attempt to say, as those opposite have said, that if we make this bill about something else&mdash;that is, if we make this bill about fundamental human rights of all Australians to health, housing and education&mdash;they will vote for it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund is to be established as part of the Commonwealth public account, ensuring the maximum level of security and accountability for the fund. The allocation of moneys to the fund was determined in the knowledge that by remaining in the public account there was not a direct effect on the deficit. Critics of the bill have suggested a more entrepreneurial approach to the management of the fund. A submission to that effect was made by J.P. Morgan in conjunction with the Northern Land Council. Higher yields may well be available from investments requiring greater risk.

Morgan, whose capital stable fund posted a negative return of 5.8 per cent for the year&mdash;a sobering downside to the entrepreneurial approach to investment of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens in particular have sought to ridicule the amount of funds made available to the ILC. The point that must be made is that the allocation represents a doubling of current funding. An annual allocation is established in perpetuity and it is managed by Aboriginal people. The availability of $45 million per year for purchases is not to be ridiculed as insignificant, particularly if the integrity of the fund is protected from the opposition's amendments. Aboriginal representatives have accepted the funding as a significant and appropriate allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, when dealing with this bill, received some criticism of the consultation process associated with this legislation. It was a theme taken up by the opposition in its minority report on the bill, arguing that the passage of the bill be delayed until further consultation had occurred. I had this terrible feeling of deja vu. I for one am a little tired of being lectured by those opposite on consultation. It is clearly another smokescreen for their basic opposition to the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund proposal was included in the Native Title Act that dominated parliamentary proceedings last year. During and since that time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has consulted with Aboriginal organisations in framing this bill. ATSIC has conducted its own extensive consultations. A broad consensus among Aboriginal groups was reached in June and the bill has been available for months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition seeks to gain support for its position from a Mr Dickey Cox, who appeared as a witness before the finance and public administration committee and who complained of a lack of consultation. It is worth noting not only that he had correspondence with his local MP on this issue in May and received a copy of the bill from the Prime Minister's office, but also that, to my knowledge, Mr Cox has appeared before three parliamentary committees since December last year. Each of those committees was dealing with native title and land fund legislation. Clearly, Mr Cox has had some opportunity to be consulted on these issues. He has offered no substantive objections to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Liberal Party to raise consultation as an issue in this debate is the height of hypocrisy. The government's consultation process is on the record. The consultations involved in developing the Liberal Party's amendments, publicly revealed only as the legislation was introduced into the parliament, remain a mystery. Those amendments, developed in isolation, remain devoid of Aboriginal support. That the Liberal Party in WA introduced its Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 into parliament without any consultation whatsoever should also be remembered when assessing the Liberal's criticism of consultation processes in the area of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An argument has been raised by the New South Wales Land Council primarily regarding the purpose of the bill. Concern has been expressed that the absence of the preamble to the Native Title Act in this legislation has some profound implications. I see this issue has now been taken up by the Liberal Party. It is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister made it clear that the whole purpose of this legislation is to address land acquisition for those dispossessed and unable to benefit from the native title legislation. The two pieces of legislation are constituent parts of a total response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the legislation does not set out detailed criteria for determining who should benefit from land acquisition. It makes no attempt to determine priorities between dispossessed indigenous people or to determine who might benefit most from land acquisition. That role is quite properly given to the directors of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the majority of whom must be Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition comes at this issue from yet a different angle. It is keen for a strict separation to be kept between native title and land acquisition. It fears the land acquisition fund being used to purchase pastoral leases that may then be converted into native title under section 47 of the Native Title Act. The parliament particularly provided in that section an opportunity to redress prior extinguishment on pastoral leases provided that the applicant would still need to show the existence of any connection with the land or waters concerned that may be required by the common law concept of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no good reason for a lease purchased with ILC funds to be treated any differently from leases purchased with funds from other sources. The Liberal Party's objections are a reflection of its ideological opposition to native title and the public funding of Aboriginal purchase of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a delightful irony in the Liberal Party's approach on this issue. It dismisses the government's attempts to recognise that native title rights may not involve full proprietorial ownership of land and insists that purchases from the fund and native title must be completely divorced. This is from the party which legislated in Western Australia to replace native title rights with rights to traditional usage. The Liberals, of all people, should acknowledge that native title may not provide exclusive proprietorial ownership and that purchase of land might be required to fully restore Aboriginal connection with the land. That is what this bill provides for, without in any way diminishing the commitment to providing land for those already dispossessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this bill represents a genuine attempt by the government to partly redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people from their land. If enacted it will, together with the native title legislation and the social justice package, mark a tremendous commitment to addressing the wrongs perpetrated against Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does have widespread support among Aboriginal people and is the result of extensive negotiations with Aboriginal representatives. The government's consultation and negotiation process in forming this bill compares favourably with the consultation process of the bill's critics. I urge the Senate to support the bill. </PARA>

I make my remarks in the context of having been a member at the time of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which looked at this bill. First, I would like to refer to the remarks made by Senator Coates yesterday when he rose to speak on this bill. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ellison&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Campbell or Senator Troeth read the draft of this minority report before they signed it. I do not believe they could have.</PARA>
<PARA>I beg to inform Senator Coates that of course we read the report. I would not be signing a report that I had not read. The remarks contained in that report, as those made by coalition senators maintaining a dissenting report, are those that I wish to comment on. I take exception to the remark by Senator Coates that I had not read the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During those committee hearings we had an opportunity to hear those people representing Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who, as they said at the time, had no input into consultation. Considering the point of view put by those witnesses who were called on the day, I could then make the comment that I was annoyed, angry or puzzled, to quote the remarks of Senator Coates, that the government had not taken into account the views of those witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to Senator Chris Evans that if he felt that Mr Cox was the only Aboriginal who had not been consulted on the provisions of this bill, then indeed he is one person that the government should have consulted with in the sense that the government should have had wider consultation with the Aboriginal community than it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If consultation had taken place to the extent spoken about by the government, why did those witnesses not know about it? We are talking here about one of the most far-reaching changes ever made to land ownership in this country. It is a piece of legislation designed to affect a small section of the population only. If the government had consulted as widely as Senator Coates and Senator Chris Evans would have us believe, then I would have thought that the Swan Valley Noongah Community Group and the Kimberley Aboriginal Association would have heard about some of the details of the proposed legislation. Obviously they have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out on page 20 of the dissenting report that even after Mr Cox from the Kimberley Aboriginal Association had registered his interest in the outcome, no further effort was made by the government to contact him, other than to send him a copy of the bill on 9 June after its introduction. We are not talking here about millions and millions of people on the Australian continent. We are talking about a comparatively small number of organisations and individuals. This was also pointed out by the Barunga community. The coalition does not concede that sufficient consultation has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period of time involved, it would surely have been possible for the government and its advisers to have informed the peak Aboriginal groups of the exact ramifications of this legislation. This information would have filtered through the groups to people living in outback Australia. Also, the government has not delineated how urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are to be involved in these decisions. Were these people consulted? Are they included in the list of groups mentioned on page 7 of the committee report? It would be interesting to know the range of the `wide ranging consultation process'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of this legislation on which I wish to comment is the amount of expertise that should be required of board members. This bill does not require that any members of the board have business or financial experience. The board of the Indigenous Land Corporation has the responsibility of spending $45 million per annum on property purchase, development and management. The members of the board are to be appointed by the minister as he sees fit. Obviously, a board charged with these responsibilities should have a range of experience and background. It is the view of the coalition that, as the board should be accountable, it will be much better served if individuals with business and investment skills as well as the background of cultural and environmental matters are given the opportunity to be on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To move to a wider appreciation of the board's responsibilities, it is essential that there be adequate accountability for the full value of money spent. Does the land fund bill provide for this? The coalition believes that it does not. Therefore, we will be moving amendments, none of which will restrict the operation of the Indigenous Land Corporation. National and regional strategies must be subject to scrutiny, parliament should be able to inform itself of the activity of these bodies, review should be carried out annually and not from time to time as laid down in the legislation, and grants given for a purpose should be used for that purpose. Also, the Indigenous Land Corporation should have the statutory power to ensure that this is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my 15 months in the Senate, I have attended estimates committee hearings which have shown time and time again that, in spite of the seemingly large amount of money allocated to funding for ATSIC programs, only a small proportion of funds seems to have reached the most disadvantaged people. Aboriginal health statistics for the last 10 years, and indeed the then Senator Richardson's comments after his visit to the Northern Territory in his capacity as health minister, should indicate that, in spite of comparatively lavish funding for programs over recent years, no substantial improvements have been made in Aboriginal health. Why is it going to be so different for the land fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel sure that all the assurances that have been given in other legislation that conditions will improve have been given here. But what will be the result? None of the initiatives so far put forward by this government have substantially improved living conditions for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. How is the legislation at present before us going to achieve such a transformation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set up another land fund when one already exists under the ATSIC legislation will surely compound the problem. If Aboriginal people have not found living conditions to be improved under existing legislation, why would they expect life to be any better with a second bureaucracy ready to use most of the money allocated to the land fund? Surely the staff and executives at present within ATSIC who are responsible for land matters would be available to the Indigenous Land Corporation. What we are looking at here is unnecessary administrative duplication. This waste, when all available money should be used to improve the appalling living conditions of many Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw mentioned in his remarks the attitude taken by Mr Downer when he visited the Northern Territory. I point out to Senator Forshaw that former Senator Richardson, when the Minister for Health, emerged from his tour of the Northern Territory to say, `Something must be done.' As we saw during the remaining part of the former Senator Richardson's ministry, nothing was done. Indeed, the money allocated in the next budget did not enable anything more to be done to improve Aboriginal health services. The coalition has real concerns about this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>As a Tasmanian representing a state, I would like to point out what is likely to happen when the Australian Labor Party centralises power in Canberra. We all know that there are many in the Labor Party who have that commitment of centralising power in Canberra, weakening the power of the states and increasing the power of local government. That idea has been around since Gough Whitlam, but I wonder how some of the local government areas feel when they see the way they have been treated in this era. I cite Tasmania, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter that was sent to me by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)&mdash;and to all Tasmanian senators, I guess&mdash;points out with much pride that there has been an increase of 2.12 per cent over the 1993-94 entitlement of untied grants to local government throughout Australia. It pointed out that this is the fourth year that these grants have been increased by at least the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we see that in Tasmania&mdash;and it is even admitted in this letter&mdash;the total funding of untied grants is 1.73 per cent, compared with the overall average of 2.12 per cent. This might not seem a lot, but when we relate it to the local areas, we see that it has certainly had quite an effect on the overall balance of funding in some municipalities. Three of the major ones that were hit were the city of Launceston, the city of Clarence and the city of Glenorchy. In the case of the city of Launceston, in real terms it received a reduction of $216,000; the city of Clarence, in real terms, suffered a loss of $158,000; and Glenorchy lost $102,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three areas, as my colleagues from Tasmania Senator Murphy and Senator Sherry would know, contain areas that are battling with chronic unemployment as a result of the `recession we had to have'&mdash;places such as George Town, Gagebrook, Clarendon Vale, Claremont and Chigwell. When I checked with the Clarence Council today to see what effect it has had, I found that it is considering cutting some of its programs. The ratepayers are still recovering from the recession and most local governments have regard to their ratepayers and are trying to keep their rates down. I think most councils in Tasmania have made every effort, because of the recession and because of the inflation rate being reduced, to keep their rate increases to an absolute minimum. But it makes it very difficult when there are funding cuts from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting used to this in Tasmania. Over the last 11 years since this Labor Party came to power, funding cuts in real terms to local government and state government programs in Tasmania are approaching $400 million. For a small state of some half a million people with such a large area and such a large infrastructure to control, it is very significant. It really makes me wild that we are cutting back what seem to be small amounts of money. In the case of Clarence, for instance, $158,000 is 1 1/2 per cent of its rates. In the case of Glenorchy, it is about one per cent. When that is measured out to the families that are struggling to survive, it amounts on an individual basis to quite an amount of money. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to this document, as it is not possible to deal with all the matters contained in it in the time available. In particular, page 7 of the document refers to Acton Peninsula and the West Basin and the consultations that took place during 1993 and 1994 on the future of Acton Peninsula and the West Basin with a view, as the document says, `to developing a master plan, urban design guidelines and a comprehensive development plan.' The authority says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the land is a key site in the central national area, the NCPA has argued that a major national use would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>The document then points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land is Territory Land, managed by the ACT Government on behalf of the Commonwealth. Because it is in a Designated Area, it is subject to NCPA detailed planning control.</PARA>
<PARA>It refers also to consultations that have taken place with the community on the future of this particular site. It is interesting to note that the ACT government, contrary to the views of just about everybody, has gone ahead and placed a hospice on this site.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next paragraph in the annual report refers to the National Museum of Australia, which, of course, after today no longer exists even though the name may still be around because the legislation is still in existence. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the review of Acton Peninsula and West Basin, the NCPA undertook preliminary investigations into the possible siting of the National Museum of Australia on the peninsula, consistent with its view that the peninsula should accommodate a major national use.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that this site should be used for a major national purpose; I disagree that it is an appropriate site for the National Museum of Australia. It certainly is not a place to put the odd building willy-nilly, as seems to be happening at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 2 of the annual report the authority suggests&mdash;in quite colloquial language which makes light of matters on which many Australian jobs depend&mdash;that the reason the basic chemicals industry had made fewer anti-dumping complaints in 1993-94 than in previous years was that the past protection of the industry by the authority had been so successful. I can offer an alternative explanation which, sadly, strikes me as much more likely: it could be that the basic chemicals industry has given up making anti-dumping claims because it was finding the process a waste of time and money. It could be that the basic chemicals industry has given up producing some of the items which dumped imports were hurting them in. I understand that is the case with at least one product. The authority goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . anti-dumping policy seems to have become less contentious. There was less shouting in 1993-94 than in earlier years about the `facts' that while Australia took months, other countries took only days to impose provisional anti-dumping measures; that an industry had to be on its knees before the Authority would recommend action; that action would be taken only if dumping were the sole cause of the industry's woes; and so on. All these `facts' were, of course, figments of the shouters' imaginations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a remarkable attitude for a public authority to take in answer to legitimate criticism of its services by the constituency which it is supposed to be serving. Again, I am afraid, the far more likely explanation for the lack of shouting about anti-dumping policy in 1993-94 is that the authority's constituency&mdash;the men and women of Australia who make things and try to sell them&mdash;has given up. They have given up because of the genuine problems in getting relief from dumping in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at the cases quoted in the attachment to the report. In the case of CDs from Taiwan, the authority concluded that dumping was taking place, but refused to take action because the industry was still making profits. This is unacceptable. It is not for the authority to decide what is an appropriate level of profits for an industry. Without the dumping the industry could have been more profitable. According to this reasoning, any company making profits or expanding in Australia automatically forfeits its right to protection from dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar argument appears to have been made in the case of home brewing kits. In the case of textile yarns, the authority reached the bizarre conclusion that the product was being dumped and that the Australian company was being damaged, but refused to take action because it was not sure that the dumping was causing the damage. I would have liked to hear a bureaucrat explaining to a businessman why dumped imports that were taking his market and cutting into his margins were not causing damage to his company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of formulated trifluralin, the authority took no action against subsidised imports because the importer had switched to importing the major product input and making up the product in Australia. In other words, the foreign `dumper' was let off on a technicality while the Australian industry continues to suffer. Again, in the case of insect screening, the dumping of an inferior quality Chinese good was found not to have caused material injury. Again it is hard to imagine how it would not have caused injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 September 1994 there was a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly </EMPHASIS>that the government was considering a review of anti-dumping regulations with the intention of softening them. The same article says that ICI has warned that multimillion dollar investment proposals for its manufacturing site at Altona in Melbourne would not be accepted by its British parent if there were doubts about protection against dumped products. Amcor, it was said, has warned that investment in white paper manufacturing would go out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We call on the government to go ahead and review anti-dumping legislation in Australia, but with the intention of providing the businessmen and women of Australia with real protection against unfair trading practices. In particular, the government should look at making it less difficult for companies to prove that dumping has caused them material injury. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I looked briefly at the report of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and noted with some alarm that many of the aspects of safety that the Senate expressed concern about in relation to the Civil Aviation Authority seemed to also exist within the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The problem with the lack of urgency that people attach to the implications of safety is that, if there is not enough attention paid to aircraft safety, there is a strong possibility of them falling out of the sky. In the case of maritime safety, the implications are more likely to be accidents, slackness in addressing bilge water problems or a serious oil spill which would impact on the local economy but more importantly impact on the ecosystems in such a way that we might have permanent problems in our huge coastal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a huge problem for Australia. The Maritime Safety Authority boasted that during the year it had an operating profit of $1.1 million. In the report it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a particularly pleasing result given that 1993-94 was the first year in which there was no government contribution . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The government has removed its contribution. Not only that, but the government paid itself a dividend of $3.065 million. According to the figures, the Maritime Safety Authority is not employing enough people to provide the services that we feel are necessary. It is hardly going to do the trick to provide even the same number of people, considering the amount of concern there has been expressed in things like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of Shame</EMPHASIS> report and in the oil pollution of sea legislation which actually assured everybody that we would be paying more attention to shipping safety and not less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some figures in the report that relate to inspections. There were a total of 2,157 foreign ships inspected. Some 39 per cent of eligible ships were inspected in the year. One can only wonder how we can judge productivity. If this means that we have had to inspect more ships because there is a recognition that we have a higher number of single-voyage permits and an increasing age in the ships that are using our coast and travelling into and out of Australia, how does one judge productivity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have an increasing number of inspections taking place and possibly an increasing number of ships needing inspection, what does that say about the nature of the inspections that can take place with either the same or, I would argue, perhaps a decreasing number of people available to perform those inspections? Yet according to this report, during the year staff numbers declined from 533 to 440. That is a reduction of 17.4 per cent. So fewer people are available to perform the inspections. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In looking at the quality of international shipping the need for Australia to detain a significant number of sub-standard ships during 1993-94 confirms that improvement in quality has been disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA>Do we judge this report on whether or not there is safer shipping?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports states that there have been 252 reports of marine oil pollution. We are not looking at a diminishing problem; we are possibly looking at a greater problem. As I mentioned before, the actual age of shipping around Australia is increasing, so the possibility of a major oil spill and a breakup of the shipping that exists becomes greater. In order for us to have a better idea of the possible problems posed by the shipping using our coasts, it would seem that we have to be available to make more detailed inspections and not less detailed inspections.

<PARA>For all of those people who find a lot of pleasure in reading annual reports, I recommend the 1993-94 annual report of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as quite good reading. I received it only today, but I did have a quick look through it. I note with interest that the federal government has had a review of the DPP and its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interested me in the annual report were the case reports put forward to give some indication of the range of cases dealt with by the DPP. They range from fisheries offences to drugs. There was a large number of cases of Commonwealth employees defrauding the Commonwealth. The thing that struck me was all these good Australian names such as Chun and Bipati, and Ladocki and Sundar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Operation Rustic was mentioned, which involved people such as Postiglione, Kapeliotis, Mari and Dufek. Then there were names such as Sinsamboon and Pukdeekul. There seems to be an awful lot of drugs being brought into this country by people from outside of Australia. I note that in Operation Aladdin in Victoria there were six Japanese people sentenced for importing 12 kilograms of heroin. They received sentences ranging from 15 years to 25 years imprisonment, which I presume everybody agrees with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting case mentioned in the report is one that I have brought up more than once in this place and in estimates&mdash;the Iranian Embassy. Let me refresh the memories of honourable senators. In April 1992, a group of demonstrators attacked the embassy of Iran, causing considerable damage. It was all there for everybody to see on SBS television. Not only did the demonstrators cause a lot of damage, but also they reportedly stole about $US60,000&mdash;or somebody did, because it went missing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government, which is very good at handing out money, then funded legal aid to the tune of $644,000 to defend these people. On top of that, the Australian government, in its generous mood, compensated the Iranian Embassy for nearly $500,000 for damage that was done. The government believed that the security arrangements that were supposed to have been provided by the Australian Federal Police were not sufficiently good enough. So we had over $1 million of taxpayers' money handed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with some dismay in this annual report the sentences received by the 11 defendants, who were obviously well defended with our taxpayers' dollars. Three of them convicted received custodial sentences and the remainder received suspended sentences. Two defendants are appealing against the sentences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mention of the quite generous $60,000 compensation to the Iranians. There is no mention of anybody being charged with stealing it. There is no mention of anybody even looking for it. It is a fair example of just how generous the government can be in some areas with taxpayers' funds. In this particular case, it is unfortunate that the people who caused so much damage and embarrassment to the government&mdash;and also obviously stole $US60,000&mdash;received such light sentences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then talks about all of these other cases. There are a few recognisable names such as Bond, Fairlie from Tasmania and a few others. It is good reading. I just thought I would raise that matter again tonight, because it struck me as somewhat significant that in the drug related cases, quite rightly, quite heavy sentences were received, whereas these demonstrators, who did so much damage to the Iranian Embassy, and on whom Australia spent so much money defending, received sentences that were virtually mandatory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address tonight the issue of smoking, the biggest public health problem in Australia today, and in particular the government's rejection of a recommendation, as presented in the documents to the Senate this evening, by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to place transdermal nicotine patches on the PBS list. Quite clearly, this is a stupid, callous and short-sighted decision which reeks of hypocrisy on the part of the government and one which sadly will cost thousands of lives and waste millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transdermal patches are essentially a nicotine replacement therapy to help alleviate the withdrawal symptoms of those who want to give up smoking. They take the form of patches placed upon the skin and the nicotine is absorbed across the skin. There is no doubt that they are effective. The PBAC itself has recommended listing on the basis of efficacy and there are several studies, including some in Australia, which support this. There is no question about them being effective. Estimates indicate that they are probably going to improve the chances of someone giving up smoking by between five and 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present a 10-week course costs around $300. That is about $5 a day, which is about the same as a packet of cigarettes. By itself, it is quite a sizeable amount if you happen to be a low income earner. An agreement with the pricing committee saw the manufacturer actually slash the approved price for the proposed four-week course of treatment, the proposal being that the patient would then be expected to fund the rest of the course from the savings made by not having to purchase cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some debate about how these should best be used, and the government's rejection indicated that it was not happy with the proposed method. The company itself supports the product with a free anti-smoking kit, tapes, diary and brochures to support people going through a tough time. It supported the idea of a PBS listing as a restricted once only script available through GPs, who are then meant to counsel patients and to go through the important things such as triggers that start people smoking again, to make sure that those who are genuinely motivated to give up smoking and who could benefit from the patches, therefore, would be able to wheen themselves off nicotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some alternatives such as support groups, but there really is a need for professional input from the medical profession because, although side effects are fairly minor, they do occur in patients with blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems. The PBAC, for those who are not familiar with it, is a committee appointed by the government made up mainly of medical and related experts who process applications largely from drug companies seeking to have their products listed under the PBS. It meets four times a year and operates under guidelines requiring that it takes into account that the medication is effective and is cost efficient. The recommendations are usually sent to a pricing committee and then referred either to the health minister where the cost is less than $10 million or to the cabinet if above $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only previous rejection of a PBAC recommendation that I am aware of was by the previous minister, Graham Richardson, who refused to list the migraine drug sumitriptan. This process is being curtailed here, apart from the blocking presumably by Minister Lawrence, by not having been submitted to cabinet as far as I can determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBAC said that the patches were clearly effective in a significant number of patients, that they were cost effective, that they were safe and that, therefore, they should be listed on the PBS, preferably in a restricted manner to allow one course to be started to initiate patients in this therapy. On that basis, the government's own appointed experts&mdash;let us make it very clear&mdash;have said, `List these products; it is worth while financially, it is worth while medically.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what then is the government's position? A statement has been issued and tabled in the Senate this evening&mdash;with no minister taking responsibility, I might add, but presumably with at least the blessing of Minister Lawrence&mdash;rejecting the listing on the ground of a $100 million alleged cost and also the claim that this is a state matter. According to the PBAC documents, there is apparently an agreement that these smoking cessation programs are a state matter. What other drugs are state matters? Is there any evidence of the various states purchasing these patches? The answer is a very resounding no, there is no evidence of this at all. This is buck-passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claim of $100 million is a grossly inflated figure. There are about 3 1/2 million smokers in Australia and it is estimated that about a quarter actively attempt to quit in any one year. Seventy-five per cent of those quitters actually go cold turkey and the remaining 25 per cent seek some support&mdash;counselling, hypnosis, medication or other products, such as the patches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the government's figure to be even vaguely accurate, every single would-be quitter in every year would have to seek a prescription for the patches. That clearly does not, and clearly never will, happen. Importantly, I point out that the patches have been available to war veterans for some time but the demand for them has been so low that the conditions for their use had to be watered down to encourage the war veterans to use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the government's estimates are grossly inflated. The industry estimates that the figures would be at a maximum of around 300,000 people per year. Even on this basis, in this extreme case, the actual cost is about a fifth of the government's estimate; that is, $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at how this stance, this refusal to help people give up smoking, matches up with the government's past rhetoric on anti-smoking measures. All previous health ministers, as well as the current minister, Dr Lawrence, have spoken often, and rightly, of the evils of smoking and the need in both economic and human terms to encourage people to quit. On 10 August this year Dr Lawrence spoke about figures that showed that teenage smoking was on the rise after 10 years of decline. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These disturbing statistics pose a serious threat to the hard-won gains in reducing tobacco consumption which have been fought for in this country. I urge all levels of government, the media, the health sector and the community to support the Commonwealth's action to counteract these concerning trends and to preserve the health of our young people.</PARA>
<PARA>Talk about hypocrisy! What has changed since August? Why does Minister Lawrence urge everybody else to combat smoking and then sit at best silent, if not responsible for this stupid and callous decision? She has not put her name to this statement, but neither has she spoken out against the decision, if it were made by somebody else and taken out of her hands. Indeed, she has claimed that when she gave up smoking she went cold turkey, implying that if she did it anybody else could. It is a clear case of the Keating government hypocrisy being exposed to all the groups that Dr Lawrence urged to help in the war against smoking, despite some pathetic attempt to hide behind a vague statement with nobody's name attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind this chamber how bad the problem is. Smoking kills 20,000 patients every year. It costs $9 billion a year. It causes cancer, heart disease, bronchitis and a whole host of other medical conditions. It shortens the life span of its direct victims and makes their reduced term more difficult to endure with shortness of breath and loss of limbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very clear relationship also between smoking and the social situation. The lowest paid and lowest educated groups in the community are the heaviest smokers. These are the people who could benefit from these patches and they are also the people who cannot afford the patches. These are the people who are suffering from this government's decision. The smoking rate in Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is almost 50 per cent compared with 20-odd per cent among non-Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A million Australians have died this century through smoking related illness. In 1991, Australians smoked 34 billion cigarettes and inhaled 343,000 kilograms of tar. There are 43 known cancer producing chemicals in cigarettes. Passive smoking&mdash;just inhaling other people's smoke&mdash;kills 10 people a week in New South Wales alone. It causes over a third of cancer deaths and undoubtedly affects the lifespan of people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom made a special study of 70,000 staff, and found that smoking cost that organisation alone $16 1/2 million in sick leave. If that were translated to the national work force, the figure would be $1.5 billion. Today's smokers in Australia will lose 125 million years of normal activity because of smoking related illness and premature death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt about the enormity of this problem and there can be no doubt about the hypocrisy of the government. When it suits it, the government pays lip service to attacking the problem but when it comes to the crunch of being involved in spending a small amount of money, it passes the buck. Sadly, the worst affected are those on low incomes and Aboriginals, those very people that the ALP claims, falsely of course, to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is short-term cost cutting, but there is a long-term cost. Sadly, the cost is not only financial but is a cost in lives and in suffering. I plead with the government to reverse this decision and, for once, to practise long-term preventive medicine and invest in the long-term health of the people of Australia&mdash;to fulfil the responsibility entrusted to it by the people of Australia. To do otherwise is simply gross hypocrisy. To do otherwise is simply to abandon any pretence of caring for the health of Australians. There is no doubt about the size of this problem. There is no doubt that this solution is not the answer to the whole problem, but it is a partial solution that potentially will save thousands of lives. </PARA>

For four years we have had developing a terrible drought that is devastating rural Australia. Our Prime Minister, Mr Keating, tried to ignore the development of this drought for most of that four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in northern Queensland in July, Mr Keating was there with me. He visited Cairns and Townsville, and that was fine, but I challenged him to go outback&mdash;to go to Roma and Longreach to see the real effects of this drought. This of course he refused to do. Eventually, he went out to Dubbo for a day and he went out to south-west Queensland. He came back and delivered a $165 million package to be spent in the next four years in countering the effects of the drought. I would like to point out to the Senate the gross inadequacy of this package and in particular the fact that in New South Wales&mdash;my state&mdash;96 per cent of farmers who are affected by this drought get absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see the reaction of some of the bush members of the ALP. We have members like Eric Fitzgibbon, who has finally blown the whistle on this government and has said what the government is failing to do for the voters in his electorate. Last week the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) lamely defended the federal government's policy. They said that if people were not eligible for the drought relief funds&mdash;and indeed all farmers on the northern coastal area of New South Wales are in that position&mdash;there was already the Farmhand fund. The Farmhand fund raised $12 million and I believed that it finally shamed this government into trying to do something about the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welcome though that money is, charity is no substitute for proper public policy. It is quite interesting that now Eric Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, has blown the whistle on the government on this issue.

But where are the voices of Harry Woods in Page and Neville Newell in Richmond? We do not hear them speaking out in a similar forthright manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Eric Fitzgibbon points out, it is the federal government's responsibility to help with drought assistance, particularly in this extreme situation when this terrible drought is devastating so many farmers. By relying on the Farmhand appeal money, the government is just substituting charity for proper public policy. When will the government help? We on the north coast are in a terrible situation in an area that is not considered to be experiencing extreme drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the effects of the drought are obvious. The cattle breeding herds of the North Coast near Casino, near Grafton and in the Hunter will soon be wiped out if they do not get any further help to help maintain this very valuable domestic and export beef industry. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture has estimated that 150,000 cattle in the Upper Hunter will have to be sold or shot in the coming months. Stock are now dying from starvation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bleak picture of drought also has a very human dimension. How does the minister tell a farmer who has no food and income and who has borrowed tens of thousands of dollars to keep stock alive that 23 months of continuous drought is not enough to qualify for federal help? This has happened in Scone and in Merriwa in the Hunter electorate. One farmer up there thought that he had assistance and was then told that the area was not eligible for this government package. That man was considering suicide because of the despair of having been offered help and then Social Security saying he was not eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the North Coast the acute drought is having a special effect because this is normally a high rainfall area. The effect on the area is far greater than in the inland, which is used to sparse rainfalls. Minister Collins said he had to draw the line somewhere for the assistance package. The Senate should note tonight that this line is far too inflexible and far too mean, as it leaves out so many farmers deserving of help in this the worst drought this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is refreshing to see the New South Wales coalition government, having promised over $20 million in August, now coming up with an additional package of $65 million that is comprehensive and will aid a wide range of farmers. They will not have to follow these very stringent guidelines that the federal government has laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fahey government has appointed a drought relief coordinator to see that the money and services are effectively delivered. The local council rates are to be relieved from farmers and rural businesses in the drought declared areas. A decision has been made that interest subsidies are available to non-farm businesses suffering trading difficulties and there is a budget of $5 million like the Queensland scheme. Today Senator Schacht declined to match such spending. This was pointed out by Senator Macdonald today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of the New South Wales government for ongoing assistance when the drought eventually breaks is also there. When Senator Macdonald and I were up north of Kyogle the week before last a number of the farmers said to us, `After the drought ends, that's when a lot of our problems will start because we've got to re-stock and get ready for the next cycle. A lot of the people in the city will forget us because they'll think that the problem will be over.' It is refreshing to see that the New South Wales government has recognised this and is putting funding into post-drought money at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further $10 million is being added to the rural adjustment scheme to match the federal money. The private vehicle conveyance of school children subsidies will be doubled at a cost of $7.5 million. More than $1 million has been put aside for the humane treatment of drought affected stock. Other initiatives include bore deepening grants to the north-west of New South Wales, where the aquifer under the cotton growing areas has now been pumped dry. The running of special free fodder and water trains to cart into drought areas has been made available on a similar basis to bring fodder from areas such as Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the free carriage of charitable goods by rail in New South Wales. The government also proposes an increase in agistment grazing of drought stock on crown land and state recreation areas. There will be relief for drought affected families with school expenses, including $4 million on tripling the number of boarding scholarships at New South Wales agricultural high schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very comprehensive program when we consider the difficulties of farming families and the regions of New South Wales farming areas that it covers. It is in stark contrast to the mean-minded approach of the federal government. It is welcomed that some government members are now acknowledging this publicly. Let us hope that they have some influence in their party room in getting the government to change its mean-minded policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition government in New South Wales does not have the budget resources of the federal government. Despite this, it is moving to help in a comprehensive way. The federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, must rethink his package and his commitment to alleviating suffering in rural Australia. Let us see whether he can do a little better by providing assistance to the 96 per cent of farmers who are getting no help. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1971" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) While a formal Government response has unfortunately not been tabled to date, the ATO has been active in addressing the Committee's recommendations. A formal Government response will be tabled in the 1994 Spring Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) &amp; (4) No. The ATO does collect statistics of the amount of gifts claimed in the income tax return of individual taxpayers. However, the ATO does not collect separate statistics of gifts to particular organisations claimed under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act (ITAA), nor does it collect details of trust distributions to non-taxable entities such as charitable institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a system of self-assessment, the ATO relies on statements made by taxpayers in their returns for the purpose of making an assessment. As such, taxation returns seek only limited information about income and deductions, with further details sought if a taxpayer is selected for audit. In relation to deductions claimed for donations to charitable organisations, the tax return seeks only a total figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To amend ATO systems to maintain details, for example, of the amounts claimed as deductions each year for donations made to each of the charitable organisations listed in section 78 of the ITAA would be a substantial and expensive exercise for very little benefit. Such a change would have a significant impact on ATO processing with the very likely possibility of increasing turnaround time for assessments, particularly in the case of the many taxpayers who claim donations to a number of charitable organisations each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an issue of how donations or contributions are claimed by entities other than individuals. Donations can be claimed either as a gift or as a legitimate business expense. For example, large donations made by the corporate sector can be claimed as a promotional or advertising expense under section 51(1), as opposed to section 78 of the ITAA. To try to record the specifics of these claims would add further complexity and expense. Further, to the extent that information was not provided electronically, there would be a massive workload involved in keying the data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) One of the ATO's Victorian Branch Offices has, in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act), provided a list of organisations which have been approved under section 78 of the ITAA in that State.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each Branch of the ATO does keep a register that lists all organisations that have been granted tax deductible gift status by that Branch for the purposes of the ITAA. The largest category of organisations approved for this purpose is public benevolent institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO has recently taken steps to ensure that future requests for information contained in the Registers will be treated consistently.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) During a courtesy call on Lieutenant General Grey on 24 June 1994, Major General Delhome mentioned briefly an interest in possible expansion of combined activities between Australia and France to include headquarters-level exercises at some future stage. General Delhome also invited an Australian delegation to attend celebrations in New Caledonia in May 1995 to mark the end of World War II in the Pacific. He also flagged a proposal for a cultural exchange involving school children of French and Australian military families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General Delhome has subsequently written to Lieutenant General Grey, with a specific invitation for an Australian Army officer to visit New Caledonia in October 1994 as an observer to the annual French military exercise, and has further raised proposals for cultural exchanges involving Australian and French school children.</PARA>

There may be some scope for a modest increase in activity, noting the positive development in recent years of French policies on New Caledonia and nuclear testing.
