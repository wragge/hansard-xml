I am also aware that I am stepping into large shoes. Senator Sibraa has made a reputation for himself as a very effective and competent chairman of this Senate. He has presided over it with fairness and dignity. He has also represented us in the various fora in which the President has to represent us as the Senate and as a parliament in a very distinguished way.

This is not simply the product of the current disposition of numbers, which we are all having to adjust to fairly rapidly, as a result of circumstances. It is also a result of the fact that the community is placing very heavy demands on the process of review. It is demanding that it be accessible, more efficient, more practical and more down to earth. I look forward to honourable senators' support and cooperation in that incremental process of reform that hopes to build upon the good traditions that we had with good, innovative, practical ideas which make this a truly sensible and proper house of reform.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Government in the Senate)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, let me be the first to congratulate you on behalf of the government on your election, uncontested, to this very high office. We are very confident that you will honourably fulfil the finest traditions of impartiality, commonsense and efficiency in your occupancy of that chair. Indeed, if we had not been so confident of that, we would not have supported you to occupy it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You came into this place in 1987 after a very long background and set of experiences in education, the trade union movement and party administration. You quickly made your mark in this place as a very effective parliamentarian. I think in particular of your role quite recently as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities, but also of a number of other committee tasks that you have performed with great efficiency and effectiveness over the years, as well as performance in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say on behalf of my colleagues that you have also been a very effective party politician. It is quite fair to say that one of the reasons that we in government have had such a calm and orderly time over the last few years&mdash;in spectacular contrast to experiences in some other places&mdash;is a function of the way in which you and others in this place have soothed and smoothed the way and created an environment in which the government can effectively govern with the minimum of distractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now you are moving into a position that will have your talents very much more on public display than I guess they have been over the last few years. We have every confidence that you will perform these functions with very great competence indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I saw you described in one newspaper article not so long ago as bespectacled and cherubic. We can all see the bespectacled bit; the cherubic side of your nature is yet to be enjoyed by more than a small handful of your colleagues. But we have every confidence that, notwithstanding the way in which your cherubic nature will be tested from time to time by the rigours and cacophony of this place, you will do the job admirably. I wish you well in it on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the occasion, as you said also, Mr President, for us to farewell our colleague Kerry Sibraa, whose last appearance in the chamber this now is. Kerry Sibraa has had, I believe, a quite outstanding career in this place since he first entered it in 1975&mdash;19 years ago. He has had almost complete continuity of service. There was a slight hiccup not so many years ago and on occasions he has found himself in the death seat, as it has been described in the political process. But each time Kerry, being the highly professional, highly competent and highly esteemed politician that he is, has overcome those difficulties and bounced back&mdash;and forward. He has had a very successful parliamentary and political career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The culmination of that career has been his tenure as President of this Senate since 1987, involving re-election on three occasions to that post, which I believe is a measure of the confidence with which he has been regarded by all of us in this place, cutting completely across party lines, and a measure of the very great skills and competence he has brought to his occupancy of the chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an easy thing to manage a house like this. We have not got quite the same reputation for rowdiness or impossibility in terms of discipline as, unfortunately, is enjoyed by the other place, but it is not an easy chamber to manage, particularly when there is not the automatic support of the majority of senators for actions that on occasions the presiding officer might be minded to take in order to re-establish order and discipline. I have no doubt that if that had ever been put to the test very squarely and directly Kerry Sibraa would have had that support but, nonetheless, it does create an environment of very great difficulty for any presiding officer in this place. That ought to be acknowledged. The role that Kerry played with such effectiveness ought to be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry's role behind the scenes as an administrator, in conjunction with his colleague the Speaker, is also one that I think ought to be acknowledged on an occasion like this. The movement of the parliament from the old building to the new one in 1988 was a huge managerial exercise. Kerry and the Speaker shared between them the administrative responsibility for this place&mdash;and did for that move. They did it superbly well. We ought to congratulate Kerry again for that achievement and for the many other management tasks, many of them of great sensitivity and difficulty, that he performed admirably over that long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry, you have been a very hospitable President, as I think every one of us in this place can attest. You have used admirably the resources available to you for that purpose. We have enjoyed the very spirited and convivial way in which you carried out your duties in that respect. You carried them out so well on a number of occasions that you were faced with the difficulty that all of us have had from time to time of, after a very pleasant evening, having to deal with a quite complex and difficult situation in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I will go to my grave remembering just a couple of occasions when Kerry Sibraa had forgotten to switch off the button and he had been plaintively heard to be saying, `Harry, Harry, what do I do now?' It was a perfectly understandable and human response to a situation of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry Sibraa, might I also say, has been a very effective ambassador in his job as President of this Senate. It is a job that has constantly involved playing that particular role, both here and overseas. He has not resisted the role of being a travelling ambassador for his country. Indeed, as I recall, he is the author of that now immortal expression that the most musical sound on this planet is the rattle of the first class drinks trolley on a Qantas Boeing as it climbs off over Botany Bay. That is a statement that has done him considerable honour around the world as people have nostalged and empathised with him, not least in some of the darkest hours we have been stuck in this particular chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry Sibraa's ambassadorial skills have produced, among other things, Australia's role as host of the CPA conference in 1988, which was a huge success and in which he played a crucial role as joint chairman and, of course, the very successful IPU conference just last year, which is regarded world wide as by far the most successful event of its kind ever held. Kerry Sibraa, as President of the Senate, deserves an enormous amount of respect for the role that he played in bringing that off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will be going to other things. It has been announced already, but subject to executive council formal approval&mdash;which I do not think will be denied&mdash;that Senator Sibraa will very shortly be taking up the post of Australian High Commissioner to Zimbabwe with accreditation also to six other countries: Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and Angola. That reflects the esteem that I and his professional colleagues have for him for that ambassadorial role that he has played, and in particular the role that he has played in relation to Australia's relations with Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a set of relationships that Kerry Sibraa has been developing personally with great effectiveness and assiduousness over quite a long period and he is very well known around Africa&mdash;as indeed he is in many other parts of the world&mdash;and very highly regarded. He has been the leader of Australian delegations to several South African development coordination conferences. He was invited by the Commonwealth to participate as an observer in Zambia and more recently by Eritrea, as indeed have some of his other parliamentary colleagues. He is very much a specialist in that area and I think in his occupancy of that position he will do Australia proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that I speak not only on behalf of Kerry Sibraa's party colleagues when I congratulate him on a job splendidly well done and wish him well for the future; I am sure I speak also on behalf of all the other members of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to say a brief word about Brian Archer, who is also retiring from this place, as honourable senator's will have heard in the initial announcements today. Brian has been one of the longest serving members of the Senate. He was first elected to the Senate for Tasmania in 1975 and has served continuously since then. He came from a background of real estate and farming and his experiences in those professions or occupations always served him admirably in the kind of substantive contributions he was able to make to debate on a wide range of subjects, in particular economic, in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Archer was very active in committee work, having served on a wide range of committees; he chaired the Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce, Estimates Committee H, and the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. He served in the shadow ministry from 1985 to 1987 as shadow minister for science and shadow minister of state. He will be remembered, certainly by me in this place, as a formidable, effective and articulate advocate for Tasmania. The combination of Senator Archer and Shirley Walters was formidable. He was never as noisy or quite as aggressive as Shirley, but there was never any doubt about where his loyalties lay or about his capacity to communicate effective advocacy for his state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very pleasant man personally to deal with, notwithstanding any of the ideological differences, and they were legion, that one might have had with him so far as people on our side of the chamber were concerned. He was a comparatively quiet, and certainly very hardworking, member of this Senate and made a substantial contribution to this place over the many long years he was here. He will be missed. I for one, on behalf of the government, wish him well in his retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on behalf of the opposition, I congratulate you on your election. I take the opportunity to assure you of our support and respect, as we have supported and respected all previous holders of your high office. You mentioned that the precedent that has been set is that of a high standard and referred to Senator Sibraa, but I can take you back to before Senator Sibraa as well. I am pleased to hear that you intend to do your best to meet that standard because we would expect that of you as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I heard you say that you endorse the process of reform that is taking place in this chamber. We also support reform, although we are concerned that in many ways the government's definition of reform seems to be to further restrict the opportunities of the opposition. We hope that your endorsement is not of that sentiment. We wish you well in this new adventure that you have before you as President of this chamber and, as I said, we congratulate you and offer you our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to take the opportunity to place on record some comments in relation to my friend Kerry Sibraa, who has retired as President and is about to retire as a senator. It is fair to say that he was not only respected in the office he held but also extremely well liked. He was regarded highly on this side of the chamber, and I think he can retire with the satisfaction of knowing that he held and served the office with distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we all reflect on different highlights of his period in office. I think one of the highlights certainly was the time that he sat Senator Cook down. We would have liked to have seen that occur a little more&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he sat Senator Collins down once too, which could have occurred on more occasions. He was certainly reasonably impartial in his office, and we appreciated that and want to put that appreciation on record. In some ways it is a pity that, because of the factional deal that was made after the last election, he has to retire to provide the vacancy for the Labor Party to keep moving people up its ranks. But so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator Sibraa's appointment, which we note, I know of his knowledge and interest in foreign affairs. I served under him when he was chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gareth Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You didn't learn much.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I learnt considerably from him. I do not travel as often as Senator Sibraa but I recall a couple of trips to Africa that I have made with him. On one instance he demonstrated his diplomatic skills when we were in Ethiopia. Senator Alston and I had arranged a meeting with a very high official of the Ethiopian interim government&mdash;I think the vice president&mdash;and, because of some difficulty with planes, had to drop Senator Sibraa in at the last moment to take our place. What he said to us certainly was not diplomatic, but the way in which he handled the meeting I gather was exemplary, and we appreciate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry, we wish you well in your appointment in Africa. I am sure that you will serve the interests of Australia well. You demonstrated here when you were President how you can put into practice diplomatic skills in furthering the international relations of not only this country but of this parliament as well, and I am sure you will continue that in your new appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention my friend and former parliamentary colleague Senator Archer who, as has been reported, retired yesterday from the Senate. Brian was never one to sing his own praises. I found one newspaper article about him which was headed `The quite achiever is life of Brian'. In many ways I think that summarises him. In that interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In politics there are workers and people that just talk about work. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You don't see my name in the paper every day but if you do I'm not talking about silly things.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is a message for us all in that. When I look back at his record in this place, which was some 18 years as a senator for Tasmania, I look at the work that he did on numerous committees. I remember serving with him when he was chairman of the Select Committee on South West Tasmania, which was quite a difficult task. He had four years as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Publications and seven years on the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce&mdash;he was chairman of that committee for two years. That gives a small indication of the type of productive work that he did throughout that long period of community service in this place. He served as a shadow minister from 1985 to 1987&mdash;he was the shadow special minister of state and shadow spokesman on science. Science was, and still is, one of his great interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also an innovator in his former business of real estate. He was the first estate agent in Australia to establish a franchise system. Again we see it in agriculture, one of his great loves and formerly his work. He is particularly interested in the genetics of flowers and livestock and putting his views into practice&mdash;planting experimental crops and developing one of Australia's best herds of Limousin French beef cattle. He is a great supporter of Tasmanian industry, Mr President, as you would no doubt know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before entering parliament he was chairman of the Australian Clothing Export Council and a member of the Timber Industry Advisory Committee. His strong interest in foreign affairs was also well known and I thought Senator Gareth Evans might have made mention of Senator Archer's constant prodding and poking on a more sensible economic relationship with Taiwan. Some of the changes and improvements in that relationship that have occurred in recent times I think can be attributed to the pressure that was constantly applied by Senator Archer&mdash;pressure in Australia's interests and, in some instances, finally taken up by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But his work for constituents was really the highlight when I think of the work that he did for individuals in the fishing industry and in horticulture. When Tasmanian industry was having trade problems it was Senator Archer who was in there doing something for it&mdash;productive work that benefited individual Australians and particularly benefited business life in Tasmania. So he retires with a lifetime of community service behind him. He was a credit to his state; he was a credit to the Senate; and we certainly wish him well in a well earned retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Democrats I welcome everybody back to this parliamentary session and congratulate you, Senator Beahan, on your election to the role of President. One of the better things that happen in this place is that we all get to serve on Senate committees. Away from the party politicking of this place we get to know our colleagues as people. I had the opportunity to be a member of a small subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of which you were the chairman. We trekked around northern Queensland, the Torres Strait Islands and north-west Western Australia together. In coming to know you, I always found you to be a firm but impartial chairman with just a hint of a twinkle in the eye about everybody else's agendas that were running. But notwithstanding some views you expressed&mdash;around a campfire, I think&mdash;about the role of minority parties, I expect you to bring those same qualities of firmness and impartiality to your role as President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, too, you will bring a little more of the arts and a little less of the football culture that we have all grown up with since I have been in this place. Mr President, we offer you our support and wish you well, especially with vexatious points of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time allowed for this valedictory speech it is impossible to do justice to Kerry Sibraa's distinguished parliamentary career. It is also impossible to do justice to the equally distinguished way in which he carried out his duties as President of the Senate. Kerry Sibraa has stamped his own style on the Senate presidency, a style which we think has maintained and enhanced the dignity of the position. He has been fair, judicious and discerning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry Sibraa has also been a calming influence. When the temperatures rose in this place, he always&mdash;well, nearly always&mdash;kept his cool. Unlike others, he did not fall off his bike&mdash;he came close to doing so only once that I can think of since I have been here. That influence and that ability to keep his cool while all around him were losing theirs have been crucial to the good conduct of the Senate. As we all know, on many occasions he used his singular sense of humour to great effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I know how difficult it is to be an umpire. This all awaits you out there in the middle of the pitch: keeping an eye on Senator Kemp at silly mid-on; turning down Senator Bishop's constant appeals; pouncing on those underarm deliveries from Senator Ian Macdonald; stopping the sledging from getting out of hand; and, even more difficult, getting the captains on this side to take orders&mdash;all the time waiting patiently for the twelfth man or woman to bring out the drinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an easy task, but Senator Sibraa carried it out with grace and humour. When he became President of the Senate in 1987 the then leader of the Australian Democrats, Janine Haines, told Senator Sibraa that his predecessor, Senator Doug McClelland, would be a very hard act to follow. She warned Senator Sibraa that he would win the support of senators only if he emulated Doug McClelland's good humour, impartiality and firmness. I think that is good advice for you as well, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Democrats have had our disagreements with Senator Sibraa&mdash;small ones I think. But I think we can all well and truly say that he has met the criteria of good humour, impartiality and firmness. On behalf of the Democrats I say to you, Kerry, that you can be justifiably proud of your seven years as Senate President. We thank you for your even-handedness, for your willingness to assist and advise on procedural matters and for being, above all, an accessible and approachable president. We wish you all the best for the future, one for which you are personally eminently qualified. </PARA>

We look forward, Mr President, to your doing the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry served on many committees; they are too numerous to mention. He also served as whip.

I am sure all honourable senators agree that the ex-President has been liked and respected in this place and will be missed sadly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate you, Mr President, on assuming your office. Senator Margetts and I have every confidence that you will fulfil your role in a worthy and competent manner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know you very well in the capacity of a fellow Western Australian, but I cannot let this moment pass without mentioning that there seems to have been a slight takeover by Western Australia of the roles of President and Deputy President. Maybe there is an appropriateness in the featuring of Western Australia in this way so that, even with our isolation on the other side of the continent, we do get represented. I know that you will fulfil your role with impartiality and do justice to the dignity of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The roles of both President and Deputy President are designed to serve the parliamentary process and not the political parties. So I cannot but express disappointment and regret that the appointment of President has not followed a more realistic electoral process in that the opposition has failed to supply an alternative nomination. This means that, on two occasions now, the Liberal Party has failed to nominate a candidate whom it knew well had the support of the Greens (WA). I speak here of Senator Margaret Reid. I think the day will come when women will gain the recognition they deserve and fulfil the positions of President and Deputy President. I think we should put on record that, if we are to ensure that we are truly democratic, we need to have a gender balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Greens (WA) support the roles of the President and the Deputy President as positions which serve the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) senators would have been happy to do that and to support individuals who have demonstrated their merit for the office, and to use gender balance as an indication of the health of the Senate. It is high time that both major parties fulfilled their responsibilities to the Senate by providing worthy individuals for the roles of President and Deputy President for selection by the Senate, not by political parties. A country which espouses democracy deserves to give the parliamentary process the respect that allows that democracy to flourish. The Greens (WA) wish you well, Mr President, in the honourable new office that you hold. </PARA>

I have known him for a long time as I knew him before then. He showed his mettle and showed that he was a truly impartial, clear-sighted observer when in 1975 he described my expulsion from the ALP as having been executed by a kangaroo court, namely, the federal executive of the ALP. This person was a young official of the Labor Party and it took courage and far-sightedness for Kerry Sibraa to make those observations. </PARA>

Senator Sibraa has experience in Africa and in foreign affairs, and on merit he is an admirable person to represent us in such a position.

<TITLE>Taxation: Leaded Petrol</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="17" SPEAKER="Hill Sen R.M." NAMEID="BH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. To the background of the government's lie at the last election that there would be no new taxes, I refer to today's tax increase on leaded petrol and I ask the minister: how does the government justify a tax hike that particularly hurts low income earners? Is this the reward that the government gives to the true believers? What calculations has the government in fact done on the effect of this new tax slug on low income earners, regional Australia and small business?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="17" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The increase in fuel excise, which takes place with the routine inflation adjustment, is an important part of the government's deficit reduction program. It will help preserve the low inflation, low interest rate environment that we obviously have at the moment that is so essential if the recovery is to be sustained. At the moment we are in the middle of a splendid recovery and the maintenance of it is obviously the key to reducing unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPI impact of today's increase is estimated to be 0.09 per cent. So, even after the fuel excise increases, Australia will still have the third lowest petrol prices in the western world, with prices being lower in real terms than they were a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The different tax rates for leaded petrol and unleaded petrol create an incentive for many motorists to switch and so help reduce the amount of lead in the atmosphere. Many pre-1986 cars can use unleaded petrol without modification. As we know, lead emissions are creating major health problems. It has been estimated that over half a million Australian children have blood lead levels which may result in intellectual development being impaired. So that impact is addressed in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the impact on low income earners about which I am specifically asked, nothing could assist low income earners more&mdash;as I hope even the opposition can acknowledge&mdash;than a sustainable recovery and that deficit reduction package of which I spoke at the outset is crucial to sustaining the recovery. The children of poor people are also affected by excess lead in the atmosphere, as I have said, perhaps differentially adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, lower income earners would have benefited from the income tax cuts announced in the budget and/or the income tax rebate for low income earners and/or the increase in unemployment and job training benefits, all of which were part of the budget which we are now financing. Any CPI increase resulting from the increases in fuel excise will be reflected in increased pensions and other social security benefits. In addition, low income earners have also benefited from past budget measures, along with the government's rejection in the budget of the regressive impact of a broad-based indirect tax system such as the GST.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Small Business. I refer to the announcement last week of the winner of the Australia Prize, which recognises outstanding achievement in science and technology. Is the minister able to provide the Senate with any information about the recipient of the prize, who I understand is an American ecologist, and can the minister explain why the Australia Prize was awarded to an overseas scientist?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="17" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as a colleague for many years I use this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the position of President of the Senate. I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Senator Crichton-Browne, who proved himself a professional amongst amateurs in gaining numbers on that side, for helping with the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Prize is an international prize which was established to recognise excellence in a specified science and technology discipline and this year it was awarded in the field of sustainable land management. Last week on Australia Day I was pleased to announce that Professor Gene Likens, who is director of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies at Millbrook, New York, had won this year's prize.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Likens has been a pioneer in his field. In 1963 he co-initiated at Hubbard Brook in New Hampshire what has become a 30-year study of forest ecology. It was a revolutionary whole ecosystems study which has brought new scientific rigour to the relatively new field of ecological science. The Hubbard Brook study has attracted young ecologists from around the world and a number of young Australian researchers have been privileged to learn ecological science with Professor Likens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Professor Likens is a very worthy recipient of the Australia Prize. But at the same time I am aware of some criticism. It is said that we should not have awarded the prize to a non-Australian.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Defence has completed negotiations for an agency agreement with unions covering defence civilian staff. This agreement has been certified by the Industrial Relations Commission to take effect from Friday, 28 January 1994. The two-year agreement, which provides for a two per cent increase payable upon certification and a further two per cent payable in December 1994, covers a wide range of productivity and efficiency measures being initiated within the context of the force structure review, the commercial support program, the defence regional support review, the defence logistics redevelopment project, the civilianisation of military positions, the devolution of personnel and financial administration and the introduction of defence quality management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement provides for a streamlined process whereby more flexible hours may be introduced in defence workplaces. Further improvements in existing industrial relations practices will be pursued through joint reviews. The agreement contains a no extra claims clause aimed at protecting the department from claims by the unions which would lead to a significant increase in labour costs during the life of this agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the pay increases should be exceeded in each year by estimated savings from defence's extensive program of micro-economic reform. These will be over and above the savings previously programmed to arise from these initiatives. The drive to improve productivity across defence places equal demands on ADF personnel and civilian staff. In many cases it would be impossible to distinguish the difference in the contribution being made to improve productivity between the military and civilian elements in defence. Hence ADF productivity reforms have been developed along similar lines to the civilian agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force has applied to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal for a pay increase similar to that contained in the civilian agreement. The matter is expected to be heard by the tribunal on 4 February this year. The defence agreement is a notable achievement, particularly given the size and complexity of the defence department and the fact that there were 18 unions involved in this agreement. It will be the first agency bargaining agreement to be certified by and for the Australian Public Service.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the review of investigations and reporting procedures is more complex because it involves not only public health issues but legal ones as well. Consequently, that part of the review will take a little longer to finalise. Our current policy of adherence to universal infection control, with HIV testing as a decision to be made on clinical need between individual doctors and their patients, does not at this stage appear to need changing. There is certainly no recommendation to that effect, and I doubt very much that I will get such a recommendation. While we will not change that basis, obviously all practitioners will need to be made more aware of the dangers that this episode has so graphically highlighted.</PARA>

As Senator Kernot has said, there have been public reports about an alleged shortfall in the funding of defined benefits in the superannuation fund for the employees of McDonnell &amp; East. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission&mdash;ISC&mdash;is aware of the circumstances of that particular fund. The provisions of the current legislation are limiting as to what measures the ISC can take, but it is following its usual approach of seeking to protect the interests of the fund members.

This was judged by the Treasurer to be in the public interest. There are no legislative provisions in the Commonwealth legislation now for any shortfall in the funding of defined benefit funds to be made good. The question of any obligation that might arise to fund members may be a matter to be resolved by an administrator, whom I understand has been appointed by the controlling company, North Quay Ltd, or in legal processes. New Commonwealth legislation for the prudential supervision of superannuation is intended to give more protection to fund members and greater powers to assist members' interests, which should generally assist cases such as the McDonnell &amp; East case.

I take it from Senator Evans's response that he has no intention of finding out, firstly, why these false returns were submitted to the ASC and, secondly, why they were not corrected until, on my initiative, the ASC demanded corrections. Judging from his response, Senator Evans feels that the Prime Minister is not responsible for a company that he half owns&mdash;that he has no responsibility whatsoever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Michael Baume this day, relating to the Prime Minister's investment in a piggery.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be aware of the fact that Senator Gareth Evans gave no response whatsoever, apart from an attempt to blackguard me, which is typical and advances the issue nowhere. The question I asked related to a very serious matter. The serious matter is that companies half owned by the Prime Minister of this country have been found, as a result of an inquiry, to have filed returns very late&mdash;illegally late&mdash;with the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies have also filed returns which were false in material particulars. They massively overstated the value of the assets in the companies and they massively understated the volume of financial losses incurred by those companies in trading. The fact that these accounts also misstated in a serious way various liabilities and various assets in those accounts simply compounds the problem. These annual accounts were supposed to have been audited at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does the ASC no credit that it appears not to have noticed that these accounts should have been audited and that it allowed unaudited accounts to remain on its register as the appropriate accounts when they were ultimately filed years late by the Prime Minister's half-owned companies. The substance of those changes is just enormous. When, as a result of my pressure, the ASC required the Prime Minister's half-owned companies to have audited accounts, the ASC and its creditors found out for the first time&mdash;creditors like the Commonwealth Bank, which is owed $17 million and whose credit committee recommended that $4.5 million of that be written off as irrecoverable&mdash;that they were falsely advised by these accounts that basically these companies had some kind of financial health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, when they were audited, five of the seven companies in the group&mdash;and Senator Gareth Evans will no doubt regard this as unsubstantiated muckraking because it does not suit him&mdash;were found by the auditors to have a substantial, and in some cases very substantial, surplus of liabilities over their assets. They were technically insolvent. They could only remain in business&mdash;and they were audited on the basis that they were continuing in business, otherwise the assets would have been worth a lot less&mdash;with the continued support of which bank? The Commonwealth Bank; the bank that the Treasurer himself was responsible for. I remind the Senate that the Prime Minister bought his interest in this company while he was Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditor's report said that these companies could continue in existence and continue to trade only with the support of their bank and also with the support of their ultimate shareholders. Who are the ultimate shareholders? On the one hand there is a Mr Constantinidis and on the other a Mr Keating. Where are the ultimate shareholders shown to have any kind of formal `responsibility' for these debts? It certainly does not appear in the Prime Minister's declaration of interests. That is why these reports&mdash;these false, late, misleading reports&mdash;were the central issue that I have been raising for two years. There is no doubt, as Senator Evans said, that there were some other peripheral matters that I raised in passing. I will be only too happy to debate them at some time, but the minister lacks the stomach to face up to the false declarations. These declarations were found to be false and have now been corrected only because of pressure from the Australian Securities Commission as a result of the pressure I put on it. It is only because of those corrections that we now know what the situation is. The Prime Minister was content to see those false declarations remain on the books of the Australian Securities Commission because he was not responsible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the withdrawal at the President's request. I do so unqualifiedly, because he has requested me to do it unqualifiedly. Senator Baume's allegations, however, have been demonstrably and consistently wrong on all sorts of key issues, particularly on every occasion where there is some element involved of alleged misuse of public office or some taking advantage of a position of public trust to secure an advantage which might not be given to people in similar commercial circumstances. Senator Baume is nodding his head because that is exactly the nub of his allegation again today, because he is now making the issue the role of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I was seeking to say in question time was that the whole community could be entirely forgiven for treating Senator Baume's allegations&mdash;or issues that he raised again&mdash;with complete contempt, given the record that he has already established. Let me remind the Senate quickly of that record. He claimed in the One Nation statement in February 1992 that Mr Keating lifted the FIRB threshold to $50 million so that the piggery in which he had an interest could enter a joint venture with a Danish company without the need for FIRB approval. However, that claim is wrong. The joint venture was approved by the FIRB under the original guidelines months before the change announced in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume and other opposition senators have alleged that the Australia Quarantine and Inspection Service was told to expedite its consideration of requests by Danish interests for live pigs and live pig products to be imported into Australia. The insinuation was that Mr Keating had brought pressure on AQIS, misusing his office in the process, because of his personal financial interests. That again is wrong. The company in which Mr Keating has an interest has developed its pigs in Australia. It has never had any interest in importing pig or pig products from Denmark. By definition, Brown and Hatton was involved in the joint venture with Danpork because of the ban on importation. So Mr Keating would hardly derive any benefit from a relaxation of the quarantine restrictions. AQIS officers moreover told the Senate estimates committee hearing that they had never been approached by the Danpork-Brown and Hatton joint venture, nor would one expect them to have been under any circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume has consistently and deliberately misinterpreted the accounts of Brown and Hatton and other companies. On 12 November last year he claimed that Mr Keating's investment had risen in value inexplicably from $430,000 to $4.2 million within six weeks. He said that Mr Keating appeared to have been allowed to buy shares at an extraordinarily favourable price. Senator Lewis later suggested under parliamentary privilege that that was a bribe. But the audit accounts, which those opposite are so willing to talk about today, were a demonstration that the value of Mr Keating's investment has not risen at all. On the contrary, it has almost certainly fallen. In January this year&mdash;</PARA>

Whether it is the former member for Adelaide or whether it is the former member for Hinkler, they obviously have to be called to account and will be pursued actively, I would say, by honourable senators on this side of the chamber in the estimates with regard to their participation. It is also important to note the role of Mr Lindsay in the Townsville region. He should therefore necessarily be called to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Bishop just raised a few minutes ago the important area of Mr Cunningham's involvement and where he has actively courted and sought the funding in this particular issue. I would like to remind the Senate of questions that I placed at the estimates some time ago about the role of Mr Cunningham when he was out of the federal parliament for one term during which time the government, as part of the mates' deal, appointed Mr Cunningham as the administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean. During that period Mr Cunningham enjoyed the office of privilege as the administrator&mdash;I think his salary was in the order of $70,000 or $80,000 per annum&mdash;with extensive travel rights and entitlements for his family. The information that was made available then to the Senate was important and called into question his continuing role. </PARA>

Mr Cunningham, when he was out in the position that he occupied on the Cocos Islands, was important. The question now of the former member for Adelaide and the former member for Hinkler and their supposed involvement in the regional development portfolio needs to be actively monitored and pursued by this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I extend my congratulations to you on your election to the high office of President of the Senate. I am confident that you will provide the dignity and impartiality applying to this office. The hallmark of your predecessor, Senator Sibraa, apart from his presidency, was his stoic work in relation to the international arena, particularly the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. It is therefore fitting that Senator Sibraa has been given the diplomatic post in Zimbabwe with wide responsibility for a number of countries in Africa. I ask that he extend his enthusiasm to perhaps the smallest country in Africa, Zambia, where my daughter has a personal interest. I believe that Senator Sibraa will carry out his diplomatic tasks with distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>

Many of the party successes in Tasmania have been attributed to Senator Archer. They are due to his foresight in planning strategies. My colleague Senator Hill has actually outlined a lot of his parliamentary contributions to the Senate. Rather than traverse those remarks, I will concentrate on his community interests, which spread widely along the north-west coast and won him great respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years the seat of Braddon has been the heartland of liberalism in Tasmania at both state and federal levels. I would like to remind the Senate that this success is in no small part due to the work of Brian Archer. It will not be easy for the Senate selection committee to replace a man of the capabilities and sincerity of Senator Archer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for science from 1985 to 1987, Senator Archer travelled widely within Australia and brought the Canberra scene much closer to scientists across Australia. At the end of his tenure he was certainly well known within the science community across this country for his very close interest and pragmatic approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his professional capacity he was widely respected by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. He was a member of the federal executive of the Real Estate Institute for a number of years. In fact, he was president of that institute in Tasmania on four occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another interest, he actually pioneered the Limousin breed of cattle in Australia and was the Tasmanian delegate to the Australian Limousin Breeders Association between 1972 and 1986. His interests were not confined to cattle because he was a pioneer in the sheep industry. Here he also rose to distinction as a notable and very successful prolific sheep breeder. In fact, he was an executive member of the prolific sheep breeders between 1981 and 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to wish Brian Archer a long and happy retirement. I wish his wife all the best because it was Dorothy who so strongly supported him on so many occasions. The words of a rough fisherman when addressing our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on one occasion perhaps should be my parting remarks. He said that the worth of a politician is in the quality of his representation. That quality was certainly the hallmark of Brian Archer's parliamentary career. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to refer to two colleagues, the first being Senator Sibraa. I first worked with Senator Sibraa in 1971 and was a work mate of his for many years. I then joined him in the Senate from 1981 until now. I can honestly say that we have never exchanged a harsh word, even under often difficult circumstances when we have had to represent different points of view in a whole range of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that characterises Kerry Sibraa is his complete professionalism in all his duties. He pays great attention to detail. In the days when we were assessing electoral results or whatever else was happening, we both approached problems carefully and in a rather conservative way. The other characteristic that Kerry Sibraa has brought into the parliament is that of looking after the little people in both the Labor Party and the cities and country towns of this country, and also in representing the people of New South Wales. Once again, it has been his attention to detail in looking after and representing people that has been very effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate to go overseas with Senator Sibraa to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences. It has already been said how well known and how well respected he was&mdash;indeed, he was synonymous with Australia for a long period at CPA meetings. I believe that all his life's work now prepares him for the next phase of his career, or even the next career that he is going to follow. I wish him well in that career. I think he is ideally suited, with all the experience that we have all described today, to be a successful ambassador for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a person of a similar type in Brian Archer, because Brian Archer has done something very similar for the Liberal Party. I first joined what was the current industry committee under a slightly different name, in 1981 when Brian Archer was its chair. Former senator Ruth Coleman was also a chair of that committee for a period, but we have had continuity on that committee. One of the characteristics that Brian Archer contributed to that committee was a very practical approach to all the problems that come before it. That rather sums up Brian Archer's character, which is to approach things with great dignity and skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we received a fishing report. I think Brian might have felt that, having disposed of a report in the last days of the last week of December, he might well now give away his need to represent the fishing industry. I cannot say that he will now eat fish because I do not think he has ever been able to eat fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has also been a representative of a whole range of other industries&mdash;the clothing industry, agriculture, sheep and horticulture&mdash;that have been referred to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the distinction of working with Senator Sibraa. I will not claim him to be a friend because I would not wish to taint his future career or his relationship with his colleagues, but perhaps I can modestly describe him as a close acquaintance. I always found him to be impeccably fair in the discharge of his duties and responsibilities, both in the chair and outside it. I believe he enhanced his reputation as a most distinguished President by his thoroughly impartial manner in the way in which he dealt with not only his colleagues but also all other senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the conduct of the Senate is the public face of the President, as you no doubt know, Mr President, there are many obligations, duties and responsibilities outside the chamber which daily cause you to be in personal contact with senators. Much of this goes unobserved and unnoticed, as senators from both sides&mdash;very often from our side&mdash;complain to the President about the conduct of events and matters affecting them in the parliament.

It is a very responsible task that you have taken upon yourself. You have discovered in the last hour or so that it is a very difficult job from time to time. I am certain that you will get the cooperation of the majority of senators in this place to ensure that this chamber works well and does its job on behalf of the people whom we are elected to represent in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is unfortunate that our colleague from Western Australia, Senator Chamarette, introduced a bit of a sour note into the congratulations to you this afternoon. I take it as being a sour note in her complaining and blaming everybody else for the fact that there was not a woman candidate for the position of the high office that you occupy. I suggest that, if the good senator felt so strongly about that, she had it within her hands to put forward a person of that gender for that position. She chose not to and she should not blame everybody else in this place for not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I ask you to dismiss the rather sanctimonious advice that the good senator gave to you in talking about the representation from our state of Western Australia. She has not been elected to this place; she is a replacement senator for a previously elected senator who resigned. Her personal vote was a matter of a few hundred. I do not think that she is really in a position to be offering advice as to what the views of the citizenship of Western Australia are on matters. At least with the other main parties in this chamber, we see and hear from constituents and lobby groups which have expounded a range of views&mdash;not all of which we agree to from time to time, but we necessarily see them and we are able to make decisions, balance them, take them further within our respective parties and arrive at decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that I too had to introduce a sour note into  the congratulations this afternoon, but I felt that those matters should be on the record. I believe it is the first occasion&mdash;and I have not had time to check the record&mdash;that a member or a senator from Western Australia has gained either of the high offices of presiding officer of the Commonwealth parliament. That being the case, double congratulations are due to you, Mr President, on what you have achieved here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to pass on my congratulations to the retiring President, Senator Sibraa, and wish him well in his new and equally challenging position as a diplomatic representative of this country.

Many of the people who have spoken know of his work much better and much more so than I do, but I certainly join with them in wishing him well in his future career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Archer has also been mentioned in the debate. I, as chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Publications, will be losing my deputy. That was one of the positions that Brian cherished. He boasted to me some time last year that he was the longest serving member of that committee. Certainly, when any advice was needed on the committee he was able to refer back in his memory to previous decisions of the committee. You, Mr President, as a member of the committee will vouch for what I am saying. Brian will be missed on that committee, as, indeed, he will be missed from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which Senator Childs spoke about earlier. </PARA>

I think that all four senators who have been mentioned&mdash;Mr President, Mr Archer, Senator Sibraa, and Senator Bolkus&mdash;have taken on additional challenges.

I spoke far too quickly, which is one of my problems. Brian decided that he would take this new tyro under his wing and offer his support and advice. I knew that when I got up to speak in the chamber, within a minute or so I could turn around and see Brian in the chamber. For just over 12 months, every time I spoke Brian was there.

But I am sure you, Mr President, and I would certainly remember our trip to Korea and to the Philippines and that Dr Klugman did not like travelling by aeroplane. As deputy leader of that delegation, I ended up having to lead the delegation in northern Samar and Davao. We travelled in a clapped out old aeroplane and you might recall that we had to go up and stand beside the pilot so that he could leave the airstrip at Manila. Subsequently, we found our way through a rainstorm into northern Samar. When we left northern Samar, I think there was one metre left at the end of the runway before we took off in the plane.

The openness with which you addressed yourself there and the bipartisan way in which we all conducted ourselves was a lesson to all delegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you follow in the footsteps of two other presidents whom I have served with in this place&mdash;Senator Douglas McClelland and Senator Sibraa. They have given a great lead by way of fairness and justice to all concerned on all sides of the chamber. They have set a precedent which I am sure you will follow. I think their example explains the relatively better behaviour of this chamber compared with the other place. I wish Senator Sibraa well in his new diplomatic career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about Brian Archer. It was typical of Brian that he elected to leave this place without any fanfare. Brian retires from the Senate after years of service to Tasmania and to the people of Australia. He has had a very distinguished parliamentary career which has been recorded by my colleagues on both sides in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first became a senator, the Senate in the old Parliament House was a little different from what it is today. At that stage the person who was put beside me&mdash;now the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, Senator Hill&mdash;was doing a lot of overseas travel. I well recall that at that time he had a passion for plant variety rights, which I had never heard of. He was most disturbed that I did not have the same passion to leap to my feet to speak about it. However, those days were very different from what happens today. Little assistance was given to newcomers, who were expected to learn by experience. As Senator Patterson indicated, Brian went out of his way to give freely of his knowledge and guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard about Brian's interest in fishing, but science was one of his most compelling interests. He had an abiding enthusiasm for science and scientists. He believed that scientists in Australia were neglected compared with those in other countries, and that this was to the long-term detriment of Australia. His interest was in both pure and applied science. He was a great proponent of increased expenditure on research in both the private and public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that on one occasion Brian was agitating for an increase of a few hundred thousand dollars in a particular area of interest. He would badger anyone who had his particular interests, and I was one of those people. I unearthed an article from a magazine which highlighted projected expenditure for research of some billions of dollars&mdash;billions, not millions, of dollars&mdash;in Korea. I sent him a copy of the article with a note attached saying, `Brian, I think you should just put up the white flag now'. He was delighted as it highlighted his very worthy cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one of Brian's compelling interests&mdash;this was mentioned by Senator Hill&mdash;is Taiwan. Through its representatives in Australia, he encouraged parliamentarians&mdash;of which I was one&mdash;to visit Taiwan. As a result of his efforts, many have. As was indicated, I think by Senator Hill, there is no doubt that Senator Archer's lobbying helped diminish his perception of what he felt was unfair treatment of a country with which we had so much trade. A development of great satisfaction to Brian which occurred not too long before he retired was the introduction of direct flights between Taipei and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Brian is a person of great principle who admired greatly those he perceived as having integrity and honesty. He was absolutely unforgiving of those he believed had acted in any way dishonourably. Knowing this, I might say that I was honoured that Brian saw fit to let me know in advance of his intention to resign. </PARA>

Similarly well appreciated is Brian Archer's capacity as an advocate on a personal level for individual constituents, particularly those with problems in trade, transport, small business, primary industry and, as has been mentioned often, especially the fishing industry. In fact, during the debate on the future of Australia's prawn fisheries I was quickly introduced to Brian's comprehensive knowledge of that area. </PARA>

From personal experience I know that that helpfulness extended across party lines, and I for one appreciated that. His interest in and dedication to certain issues was also pursued across party lines. He demonstrated this when he crossed the floor to vote against his party on the issue of tobacco advertising, demonstrating not only his courage on certain issues but also his breadth of interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many others have reminded us, Brian Archer's range of interests was fascinatingly wide. An area of interest which illustrates his capacity for innovative thought and practical benefits for all Australians is the use of aircraft for firefighting. It was more than 10 years ago that Brian Archer asked sensible questions about using aircraft to dump water on bushfires. This matter was raised in the news media very recently. Almost a decade ago Brian Archer joined people such as Norm Sanders and Colin Mason in expressing an interest in this subject. Senator John Coulter has pursued that interest in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Archer will be well remembered for his persistence in following many issues. I particularly remember that, late one night, Brian Archer revealed to the world that the proposed new user-pays charges to be levied upon primary producers for the conduct of the national residue survey would be applied in a disproportionately unfair manner. I am sure it is not unfair to remind Minister Cook that at that time, as the minister representing the minister for primary industries, he was unable to satisfy Senator Archer with an explanation as to why onions would cost considerably more to survey than potatoes, carrots or any other vegetables for that matter. The minister tried several times to brush off Senator Archer's concerns, but he was confronted with evermore basic, plain and unequivocal demonstrations by Senator Archer that the straightforward, commonsense of his argument should prevail.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been impressed by Senator Sibraa's fairness and, at the same time, his firmness when dealing with issues in this place. I think he has had a very practical approach to his role as President of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about Senator Archer. I once said to ex-Senator Peter Baume that, when I came to this place, I had a fairly jaundiced view of the opposition, which is not unexpected from a militant trade union official. I set out to dislike everybody on the other side of the chamber. I found that some people on the other side of the chamber made it very easy for me to continue to dislike them. But there were those who made it a bit more difficult because they were really decent people whose views differed from mine.

I was appointed to the committee that he served as deputy chairman and had previously served as chairman, that committee being the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, as it was called at that time. Like Senator Patterson and Senator Parer who spoke before me, I must say that Senator Archer's role in this place seemed to be to look after new members as they came into this chamber and to make sure that, firstly, they did not get lost; secondly, they knew exactly what was on the agenda of whatever meeting they were going to; and, thirdly, they were shepherded through those early stages of being on a committee. He did it with a sense of fairness which has been acknowledged by Senator Burns and Senator Childs, particularly in relation to the industry, science and technology committee. I do not know whether or not it is something to do with Tasmanian senators, but the other committee I happened to serve on was chaired by Senator Watson and I think he has those same qualities of fairness that Senator Archer had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past 18 months of serving on the committee with Senator Archer, I have come to appreciate the efforts that he put into committee work and certainly the guidance that he gave me, as my senior coalition colleague on that committee. His advice has been invaluable. Certainly on that committee I came to know the extent of his knowledge, particularly of the fishing industry which we seemed to spend a long time on, as Senator Burns well knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember Senator Archer particularly for one thing that he said probably on the first or second occasion that I attended a committee meeting. I remember walking with him to the committee hearing when there were a couple of decisions to be made in relation to an inquiry into tariff structure or some imposition of tariffs. Brian said to me, `There is one thing that you have to learn here, young fella. The important thing is that, whatever the politics are, we have to make sure that the result we get is the right result, that it is a good result and that it is good for everybody. It is important that we get it right'. </PARA>

I hope that I have learnt from him and that I will be able to put some of his good attributes into practice as I continue on that committee. I certainly thank him for his help and wish both Brian and his wife, Dorothy, who was wonderful company whenever we went anywhere together, all the best in their retirement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to add a couple of things that I think he has done exceptionally well. One is the joint functions that we have had in the private dining room, which have been conducted with the Speaker. I am quite sure that all those who attended those functions would agree with me that the previous President, Kerry Sibraa, always spoke for only a short time, was always right to the point and was not quite as longwinded as some of the Speakers from the House of Representatives were over time. Honourable senators in this chamber will know who I am talking about when I say that. Senator Sibraa's work for the CPA, which I had a bit to do with on the executive, was excellent, as was his hosting of the IPU conference, which has already been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area I would like to cover was mentioned by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot)&mdash;that of rugby league. One of the highlights of the previous President was the fact that he brought such a popular sport into this parliament by way of the rugby league friendship committee and the way in which he extended hospitality to all those people who wanted to participate in that committee, which fostered goodwill between the people of this place and one of the premier codes of football in Australia. Senator Gareth Evans has already mentioned Kerry Sibraa's hospitality, which I also acknowledge. It was fantastic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry Sibraa has always been a political foe of mine. He was the President of Senate and, in that capacity, he was a friend.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has already been made of Brian Archer and the fishing industry. I commend him for the work he did.

He was a top committee person and we owe him a lot for what he did. As a Limousin breeder he did a lot for that breed in the country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to be associated with the comments made about Senator Archer. I got to know him through his very great interest in foreign policy, especially in respect of relations between Australia and Taiwan. It is fitting&mdash;following on from Senator Brownhill's observations&mdash;that I should have come into the chamber having chaired a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which met with the President and Vice-President of the Taiwanese parliament. Ten or 12 years ago people would not have believed that possible. In no small measure it is due to the work of Senator Archer. His formation of the Australia-Taiwan parliamentary friendship group and his continual interest and energetic advocacy of improved political ties between the two countries have meant that over recent years the linkages have grown and prospered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those observations, I would like to say a few words about my friend Kerry Sibraa. Like Senator Richardson earlier today, I can best put this in a personal context. In the latter part of 1975, not long after the defeat of the Whitlam government, I was approached by the then assistant general secretary of the New South Wales ALP, Graham Richardson, and asked whether I was interested in going to work for a new senator&mdash;Senator Sibraa&mdash;whose political interests were much the same as my own. He had been elected at that double dissolution general election. His particular interests were foreign affairs, defence policy and industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After thinking it through for a week or two I put aside an invitation to write a doctoral thesis and went to work for Kerry.

Unfortunately, I cannot put them all on the public record, but when the inevitable round of farewells start for Kerry I am sure a few of us will tell stories in a very good natured way. I learnt a great deal. I learnt a great deal about the history of the ALP from someone who knew it intimately through his work in the trade union movement and through his work in the ALP at state and national levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have remarked on Kerry's interest in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, his interest in the politics of Africa and his capacity to act as the patron for a number of community organisations. But perhaps one thing that is not really understood about him is that Kerry is also a formidable electoral campaigner. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the Electoral Act. He was obliged to acquire that knowledge in that he ran on a number of occasions from the death seat&mdash;I think he coined that expression&mdash;being the final Senate seat in New South Wales. It now has a national application and applies across the board not only in the Labor Party but in all political parties. That death seat contest for the Senate is always a very tough one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 Kerry was elected by only 2,054 of the literally millions of votes that were cast. So he acquired a very great working knowledge of the Electoral Act, election processes and how best to campaign for the Senate. In 1977 he was defeated and was out of the parliament for a short time before he came back to replace Senator James McClelland, who retired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many stories that I cannot tell, but one I am pleased to be able to tell concerns Edward Gough Whitlam. It gives some idea of the working relationship in the office at that time. Kerry was always able to personalise political events. He told a story of the period of the ALP federal executive in the late 1960s shortly before Mr Whitlam brought Labor back to power. Kerry was responsible for organising the logistics of the ALP federal executive meeting one particular morning. Gough was always the first to arrive and he was there about an hour before the executive was due to arrive, just reading the daily papers. I think Senator Jones has heard this story over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leader of the ALP was looking at the international news and noted that there had been three or four new countries admitted to the United Nations as the result of successful independence movements. He looked up and said to Kerry, `My God, comrade, they are creating countries faster than I can visit them'. I do not know whether that remark had an undue impact upon the person who later, in 1987, would become President of the Senate, but certainly Kerry's interest in foreign policy and in visiting countries which had or had not been admitted to the United Nations is something approaching legend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is a great political campaigner; there is no question about that. I learnt a lot about campaigning in rural and provincial areas of New South Wales and beyond. I learnt a very great deal about scrutineering and about the history of the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Brownhill mentioned, when Kerry assumed the presidency of the Senate he assumed the position of patron of the all party parliamentary rugby league group. Along with recent Speakers of the House of Representatives, particularly Speaker Martin, he quickly set about making sure that there was a national involvement, and that MHRs and senators from all parties from all states and territories of the Commonwealth were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the approach taken by rugby league in recent times in making the code more of a national code&mdash;along with soccer, Australian football and, to a lesser extent, rugby union&mdash;reflects the interest of people in this parliament. It ensures that teams compete in the competition not only from the east coast&mdash;Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT&mdash;but also from Perth and other parts of the country. The game has been taken consistently to Adelaide and Darwin, and the code has become truly national. That was the attitude that the President took during that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is a very personable individual, as people have made clear. He has friendships right across the parliament. I know that stems from the late John Armstrong who, when he was first elected in 1975, said never to make the mistake of thinking that all one's friends were on one side of the political equation. Senator Sibraa came to this parliament with that view and it served him well. It has also meant that he is widely liked and regarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, in conclusion, I will miss your predecessor in a personal sense.

I remember very well when I first came to this place advice that I was given by Brian&mdash;a lot of which I think I have taken. Around the traps in Tasmania, Brian was always a true friend to all of us. In particular, both he and his wife Dorothy would always make their house available if one were in the area.

If one set out on a day's campaigning, one had to make sure one was on time&mdash;he would keep one going all day. I enjoyed the few campaigns on which I worked with Brian because he always had a good sense of humour and always worked us very hard.

Brian did a great job of chairing the backbench primary industry committee, and his leadership made its work very worthwhile. We are all indebted to him for his leadership in that area.

As Senator Loosley said, Kerry had a great knowledge of campaigning. Kerry visited Queensland to talk to a number of candidates about their campaign. At that time he carried with him an impressive pamphlet which featured a very young, fresh faced Kerry Sibraa. If I searched through my archives at home and went through all the pamphlets that I have kept over a number of years, I would probably find that pamphlet. Kerry spent some time discussing campaigns and methods with candidates. That resulted in his becoming a senator and later Senate President. Certainly the advice that he gave to those candidates in Queensland was of great help to them at that time.</PARA>

There were 43 new coalition members who came into the parliament after the 1975 election, many of them on very skinny margins and from seats that had been held by the Labor Party for many years before. So we were called oncers. The oncers get together at an annual dinner. Some of us are still in the parliament. Very few oncers have had an unbroken line. I believe I am right in saying that with Brian Archer's departure the only two persons elected in 1975 on our side of politics who have had an unbroken period of parliamentary service are John Moore and Ray Braithwaite. Although 1975 is not that long ago, it shows what infinitesimal specks we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Archer was a terrific senator and a great Australian. As Senator Calvert and others have said, he was a great Tasmanian. He represented his party so ably for so long, and if we look through the parliamentary handbook we can see the range of committee and other services that Brian provided to the parliament, and therefore to his constituents and to Australia. It is a very impressive record indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a quiet achiever. He did not make a lot of waves. He was always very firm, always very principled and always very disciplined in what he said. Above all, one of the things that endeared him to so many of us on our side of politics was that he was always true to his basic Liberal principles. That is a great monument to him. He was universally liked and respected in all walks of life and from all sides of politics. He brought to this place a lot of wisdom and a lot of expertise, particularly in the areas of agriculture, rural industries and fisheries. He had a very broad depth of knowledge of agricultural and secondary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we will not lose all of that in his retirement. I hope that he will find occasion to continue to benefit his nation through using that long accumulated expertise, wisdom and judgment. We will miss him here.

I hope that Brian and Dorothy will, in this next phase of their lives, find many more years of happiness and fruitful activity ahead of them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I would also like to make a comment on your role in the office that you have assumed. I join with my colleagues in extending to you my congratulations. I am one of those who believe that the offices of Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate are two of the great offices in this country. It is important to those of us who treasure the parliamentary system that the Presiding Officers set a standard. We all take responsibility for what occurs in this parliament, nonetheless my relatively short experience here has shown that the Presiding Officers do a great deal to set the tone for the conduct of this chamber. The authority that the Presiding Officers are able to wield is important in ensuring that parliament performs as it should perform. Television has given a particular eminence to your office. The TV cameras frequently focus on Presiding Officers each day that parliament sits, and in the to and fro of parliamentary debates their voices are often heard. In a fairly short period of time the Presiding Officers become public figures, and I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a concern about the culture which surrounds this parliament. I believe that it is a culture which needs to be changed so that the Presiding Officers of this parliament are not only seen to be acting in an independent manner but are independent. That is a message with which not all my colleagues would agree. However, it is my belief that to the extent we increase the authority and standing of the office of President of the Senate we will also increase the authority and standing of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no great complaint about the performance of the former President. I thought he was a little tough on me with a few of his rulings, but given the culture that surrounds this parliament and past practices, Kerry Sibraa was a good President, and I think each and every one of my colleagues would agree with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that you, Mr President, will further elevate the high office to which you have been elected. A few years ago&mdash;I would urge you, Mr President, to do the same if you have not done so already&mdash;I read a transcript of the conference that the Presiding Officers and clerks have every year. The transcripts are particularly interesting. I first started to read them when Mr Leo Mcleay was the Speaker in the other place&mdash;although his was an example which I do not think will be followed in the future. When reading of the experience of Presiding Officers from around Australia, it occurred to me what the potential of your office was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presiding Officers from the New South Wales Parliament have been prepared to make rulings on length of answers, and quite comfortably prepared to make rulings on relevance without any particular guidance. Time and time again we have heard from the other place how difficult it is for a Speaker to rule on matters of relevance. Indeed, the current Speaker seems to find it difficult. However, Presiding Officers around the country are ruling on relevance each and every parliamentary sitting day. Speaker Rozzoli in the New South Wales Parliament, as I understand it, is very comfortable about ruling on relevance. A former Labor Speaker from Tasmania, whose paper was given at one of these conferences, said that he was also very comfortable about ruling on such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Presiding Officers see themselves in an independent role, when they are able to rule fearlessly on such matters as relevance, they have passed two of the tests they need to pass in order to lift the standard of debate in this parliament, particular at question time. I realise, Mr President, that today was your first day in office but I was a little worried when you said that you found it difficult to rule on the relevance of an issue. I would urge you to look at what other Presiding Officers in this country are doing in that respect. I learned from a former clerk in the other place, a Mr Browning, that where standing orders are silent, the powers of a Presiding Officer are virtually unlimited. In that sense, standing orders are a restriction rather than guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that during your time in office you will help lift the standards of this parliament by the fearlessness with which you make your rulings, and by your willingness to stand up for the Senate when it is attacked. When the Senate was attacked by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) I feel that the former President did not stand up for this chamber. I believe that that is another of the duties of a President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I wish you well. I will certainly do my best to work with you. I hope that you will help establish something which I think is important: not only the independence of your office but also that your office is seen to be independent. A former Speaker from our party, Mr Snedden, decided that in order to buttress the independence of his office he would not attend party meetings, nor would he take part in tactical party discussions. I think that is a good precedent for a Presiding Officer to follow, and one which you may give thought to following. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the office of President of the Senate is one that will always be sought after. In the past it has been sought after for both good and bad reasons, but in the future I hope it will be sought after because it is one of the pre-eminent offices in this country and that it will be seen in that light. I believe that the office of the President of the Senate should be the highest office to which an individual in this parliament should seek to aspire. Once attained I have difficulty with the concept of an incumbent negotiating with the government for another job, particularly when it occurs over a period of time. Once that happens it places further pressure on the perception of the independence of the office. Mr President, I wish you well and I hope that in the months and years to come you will be seen to have added to the grandeur of what is already a very important office. </PARA>

It certainly helped me and those others who attended that particular day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other person I wish to pay tribute to comes from a different perspective from you, Mr President. Brian Archer sat on the same side of this chamber as I do. After I was sworn in, Brian was one of the first senators to come to me and say, `There are a few things I think I can probably help you with'. He took me through a number of aspects. Some of those were of very close interest to me&mdash;rural matters and the wool industry in particular. As Senator Calvert and others have mentioned, Brian was then the chairman of our rural committee. At that particular time the reserve price in the wool market had collapsed. There was much heartburning among all members of parliament about how that was going to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the wool debate I want to repeat, not verbatim but as I remember it, some advice that Brian Archer gave us that year. I think it is advice we could all heed with regard to the wool market; it applies to all market situations. He said, `Let the market work and it will gradually improve because confidence will return to all aspects of the industry'. Then he went on to say that it was very important in dealing with this particular problem to look at all aspects of the industry; from the production side, through transport to the final consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those were very wise words, from which we could all learn a lot, particularly when we see what is occurring now. He is absolutely right. The market is gradually improving. Confidence has returned to most, if not all, sectors of the industry. The price now, on a clean indicator basis, has moved up over 500c; and more wool is being moved from the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to what he said related to the fact that we must let the market work. What happened in the wool industry, particularly in those later years from 1987 during which changes were made to the act and to the reserve price scheme, was that the market was interfered with and the producers were given the wrong signals. Through the process various people lost confidence in the whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that what Brian Archer said then is coming true. I wanted to place on the public record that advice, because sometimes we, and people in industry organisations and bureaucracies, tend to think we can do it better than the market can. The case that I make proves that in the final analysis, if we try to defy the market, it will catch up with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Archer will be very sadly missed because of his straightforward thinking and the way he handled various issues. He has a great knowledge of fishing&mdash;which others have talked about&mdash;and the cattle industry. He has an interest in science and a whole host of things; and he addressed things in a very straightforward, sensible, often very simple way&mdash;I mean simple in the context that it could be understood. I hope that from time to time we will see him back here&mdash;or even catch up with him in Tasmania. I would like to put those comments on the record. I reiterate, Mr President, what I said at the start of my comments; that I wish you well in your position, and I look forward to working with you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to discuss this matter today, the day when the petrol tax price rises come into effect&mdash;the tax price rises that, according to Labor, we were never going to have. As Labor members opposite will recall, during March last year many of them went scurrying around the country and around every marginal electorate they could get to saying, `We are not going to increase taxes. Don't vote for a Hewson Liberal government because if you vote for a Hewson Liberal government taxes will go up and things will cost you more'. What do we find straight after the election&mdash;one long litany and saga of broken promises. This is yet another one which has come to fruition today. This broken promise is one of particular importance because the last election was primarily fought on the issue of broadening the tax base. The great scare campaign run by Labor was, `If you broaden the tax base, everything will go up; this will hit low income earners more than anyone else'. That was the argument run by Labor against the Liberal and National parties at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator Sherry says that it is true. He accepts then that broadening the tax base&mdash;that is the proposition he is putting&mdash;can negatively impact on low income earners. What he is not saying to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that the package the coalition was looking at took off a lot of taxes as well. Yet the proposal that this government puts forward, and has in fact implemented, is simply to increase tax without taking off any other taxes. That is the difference. The lie and the deceit of Labor's campaign were to say that a GST would put everything up without mentioning the decreases that were coming about because of taxes that we were taking off. That was the great deceit that people opposite either participated in or were so intellectually bereft of any political skills that they got sucked into not knowing what was happening, not knowing what their party was campaigning and not seeing the deceit that was being foisted upon the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a deceitful campaign in which Labor said, `Don't vote for these people; they are going to put up taxes', without mentioning that we were bringing other taxes down. The Labor Party went further than that and said, `Vote for us; we are not going to put them up'. And here it is putting up taxes. This will have a disastrous impact on low income earners. The simple reason is that, firstly, low income earners spend a greater proportion of their income on petrol than do high income earners. It necessarily follows from that fact that this is going to impact on low income earners&mdash;the battlers, the people who Labor says it is meant to represent, yet for 10 years has failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another practical reason why this will impact more heavily on low income earners than on middle and high income earners. Low income earners necessarily have older cars and necessarily, therefore, have the bulk of cars that cannot take unleaded petrol. This price rise is not just a straight price rise; it is a price rise to increase the incentive, according to Labor, to people to buy unleaded petrol&mdash;that is, unleaded petrol is going up by more. That means that low income earners, who necessarily have the cars that cannot take unleaded petrol, will be the ones who have to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Mrs Kelly to run around the country saying, `This is an environmental move; this is going to encourage people to use unleaded petrol'. That may be the case for people who have the opportunity&mdash;for people who obviously now have cars that use unleaded petrol, the high income earners, the people who have bought new cars. For them it is a bit of a windfall to be paying less, in a proportional sense, than people who buy leaded petrol. But the low income earners, those who do not have cars that take unleaded petrol or that cannot take unleaded petrol&mdash;and there are plenty of cars in that category&mdash;have to pay more. As yet Labor has offered no satisfactory explanation for this other than that lead in the environment is causing difficulty with health. We do not dispute that; of course that is true. But to pretend that this slight differential in price is going to make a difference to purchasing patterns when, in order to actually effect that difference, somebody has to go and buy a different sort of car, is simply ludicrous. The government has no understanding of how a market works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously if people have the choice, they may well make the change to use the cheaper petrol. But the case that we are arguing is for the people that do not have the choice&mdash;the millions who do not have a job and who are relying on unemployment benefits and who cannot simply change to another car. What about those people who have a low income job and cannot, at this point, change to another sort of car?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the dinner break I was making the point that the coalition believes it is important to discuss today the absolutely disastrous impact on low income earners of Labor's broken election promises which culminate today in yet another petrol tax increase. I made the point that basically Labor deceived the electorate at the last election. It went around saying, `Don't vote for the coalition people; they will give you a GST, an increase in tax', without mentioning the decreases in tax that my party was proposing at the same time. It also marched around the country saying, `Look, we are not going to put up taxes; vote for us', yet here is another example of yet another broken promise from a government with a litany of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another tax increase, and we say it will affect low income earners the most. Unlike the Fightback package, this measure provides no compensation for low income earners. The point was made that low income earners, as opposed to high income earners, will be doubly affected by this increase. Firstly, lower income earners spend a larger proportion of their income on petrol&mdash;that is obvious; and, secondly, lower income earners are least likely to have a new car that can take unleaded petrol. So it follows that they are the most likely people to be driving vehicles that take only leaded petrol and therefore they will have to pay much more for their petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has tried to say, `Look, this is an environmental move; it will discourage people from driving cars that won't take unleaded petrol'. The disincentive means nothing to those who cannot afford to make the choice. It is nothing more than another tax and another penalty. Those who can afford to make the choice of whether to buy a new car&mdash;and I think all new cars take unleaded petrol&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. High income earners now buy cars that take unleaded petrol, so the only people to be affected by this increase are middle income earners who perhaps have a chance to swap over. The argument is that this is a real incentive for middle income earners, but we say that 2c a litre is perhaps not a big enough incentive. We are not the only ones to say that; plenty of other people say that as well. We particularly say that low income earners do not have the choice as they do not have the resources to change over. We want to know what the government says in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This not only affects low income earners, but it particularly affects low income earners in rural areas. As my colleague Senator Tierney pointed out, the Service Station Association of New South Wales said yesterday that retail prices in some parts of Sydney are obviously much lower than those in rural areas and that price discounting in the metropolitan area will soften the blow for metropolitan residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no such discounting is happening in rural Australia, which is currently desperately affected. Thousands and thousands of farmers are not enjoying the incomes they used to enjoy. They are very much in what we might call the low income category with no chance to get the benefit of discounting. There are lots of old cars out in the country. We do not see brand spanking new cars purchased in rural Australia. Additionally, these people will not have the opportunity to benefit from price discounting as perhaps metropolitan people will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this price rise was announced, Mr Bruce Lunn, secretary-general of the Australian Automobile Association, also warned that people who drove cars that took only leaded petrol would obviously pay more. That is the point we are making. It affects the people who cannot afford to make the change. It is all very well for those people who can afford to make the change. That is fine. But what the government does not seem to understand is that thousands and thousands of people&mdash;low income earners, young people&mdash;cannot afford to make that choice. How many young people have a brand spanking new car that takes unleaded petrol as their first car? There are not many at all. They will be affected by this 2c a litre increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the effect on the business community. We cannot afford to say, `So what, that is the business community&mdash;it can afford it'. It does not afford it; it passes on the increase, and honourable senators opposite and I, as consumers, will pay for that through every product we purchase. Every business that uses petrol will pass on that increase; the price will be marked up. As a product goes through the production chain there is a cascading effect. So in the end the price of a lot of goods and services will go up because petrol prices go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday John Anderson, one of my colleagues from the National Party of Australia, indicated that he thought this would have a devastating effect. He actually calculated that it would cost Australia's commodity based export industries at least $65 million a year. It is all very well to laugh these things off and say, `Oh well, it is only 2c a litre', but lots of litres of petrol are used. The price keeps adding up all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Road Transport Forum said that the government had conducted a very slick PR campaign. It does not believe that the price increase in leaded fuel will deter people from using leaded petrol at all. It went on to say that in fact people did not seem to know that diesel fuel costs would also rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce executive director, Mr Bob Davison, made the point that, according to the information he had, a 1c or 2c differential would not make much difference. He said there would have to be something like a 10c price gap to make a difference in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that this measure will affect low income earners much more than anyone else as they do not have the opportunity or the money to make the change to a car which uses unleaded petrol. It is a relative benefit to high income earners who drive new cars which use unleaded petrol, but it is only a relative benefit because they also are paying more. It will allegedly make a difference to middle income earners. However, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce tells us that it will not make a difference anyway, that this is just some form of dressing allegedly to help the environment, when in reality it is only a revenue raising matter. It will not make that much of a substantive difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of my colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, Alexander Downer, repeated what every Australian knows&mdash;that the petrol bowser is just a substation of the Australian Taxation Office. This is a revenue raising measure described as being something to help the environment. In some small way it may make a contribution, but only in a very small way. In any event it will have a disastrous impact on low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, says that the increase is calculated to be 40c a week. I do not know what sort of car Mrs Kelly drives, how far she drives or how many litres of petrol her car takes. No doubt, as she lives in Canberra, she probably does not drive very far at all. She is a minister, so I wonder how long it is since she has driven her own car. Plenty of cars take 60 litres. If we calculate 2c a litre, then filling up a car just once each week&mdash;plenty of people do not live in close-knit suburban Canberra and need to fill their cars more than once a week&mdash;will cost $1.20 a week. Therefore this will cost Australians at least $50, probably something closer to $55 a year. Low income earners in particular will be devastated by this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take much longer. I understand the government wants an agreement on one speaker a side and we do not want to take up any more time than we absolutely have to. When I look across the chamber I see the specious and somewhat sickening smiles of people who openly stand up in this place and say, `You people are political ignorants; you don't know how to win an election'. What revolts me about that is that those people are basically smirking and saying, `The way to win an election is for a major party to lie to the Australian people, to deceive the Australian people as to the course of action it will take'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite sit over there and are actually proud of that. They are proud that they have deceived Australians. They think it is smart because they have another term of government and they can do what they like in that term of government, including putting up taxes. Those people opposite either participated knowingly in that deceit or are so stupid that they could not see what was happening. They were so politically unaware as to what was being said that they did not see the deceit that their leaders were foisting on the Australian public. I think that is what is particularly galling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but not least, I think it is interesting to note that during the election a letter that Gordon Bilney&mdash;who is from my state&mdash;wrote to his constituents said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet in the end, elections are about more than `policies and promises'. For, too often, those `policies and promises' have a way of changing, after a government gets in. Maybe you've noticed.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the election Mr Bilney has had plenty of opportunity to notice how much policies and promises change because this government has the worst record for broken promises. This increase in petrol tax, this broadening of the tax base, is just another example. By doing this, it is doing the things that it said in the election were so dreadful&mdash;that is, broadening the tax base and putting a greater burden on low income earners. Now, all of a sudden, it is okay. I think it stinks, and the government deserves to be condemned, especially for what it does to low income earners, particularly low income earners in rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a copy of what the then Treasurer said to the Australian people in the election. The government said that over the last decade Commonwealth taxation had averaged approximately 24 per cent of gross domestic product, that under a progressive taxation system the average tax rate rises as incomes rise and that, in a recession as people's incomes are reduced, the average tax rate falls. There is a cyclical effect on government revenues from taxes on consumer durables. I include tax from petrol in that. The government's commitment not to increase the overall taxation burden did not mean it would hold tax revenues at their recession-induced lows. It did not mean that. Over the four years of the government's medium-term fiscal strategy, the Commonwealth's total taxation revenues will remain below 24 per cent of gross domestic product. I can remember not just the then Treasurer's commitment on this issue but that of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that we would not be increasing the total level of taxation revenues in this country above 24 per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that Senator Vanstone listen to this because she put forward the notion. She agreed with the need to reduce lead in the atmosphere, and she agreed with the notion of reducing lead in petrol. I think everyone in this chamber agrees with that premise. If we agree with that premise, we then have to look at the practical difficulties of moving from refineries that refine leaded petrol to refineries that refine and produce unleaded petrol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil refineries approached the government. They said publicly at the round table discussion that was convened by Ros Kelly that they needed a smooth phase-out period, that they needed a predictable phase-out period, because they needed to make investments in the range of $300 million to $500 million to update their oil refineries to cope with producing unleaded petrol. They argued for that very strongly. They wanted a smooth phase-out period. They argued that it is a matter of fact that, because of the recession&mdash;I am sure the opposition will argue and make comments about why we have a recession&mdash;the conversion of automobiles from leaded to unleaded was occurring too slowly and that, because of that, there were two options. They would be involved in $300 million to $500 million of investment that they should not otherwise incur or, alternatively, we would have to start importing petroleum products that contained no lead at a cost of $200 million or $300 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was because of that technical reason that the government had to look at ways to ensure that the anticipated time frame for phasing out cars using leaded petrol to unleaded petrol had to be maintained. There is really only one way to do that: create a financial incentive for the users of leaded vehicles to move to unleaded vehicles and to look at ways of pre-1986 vehicles using unleaded petrol. We had to maintain that timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience overseas has shown that we can encourage this conversion rate in a fairly predictable way by having a price differential on petrol. That is the reason why we have adopted this policy&mdash;a policy that we all agree with. We all agree that it is desirable, and we all agreed some years ago to phase lead out of petrol because of the well-known health risks. The problem is that it has not been occurring quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This technical issue that was advanced by the oil industry is unfortunately not an issue that I have seen debated very much in the media or, indeed, by those opposite. It is a very important issue; it is a very critical issue. One interesting fact is that the usage of petroleum products is about 55 per cent leaded and 45 per cent unleaded. As the years go by, the proportion of leaded product used will decline quite dramatically. The interesting thing is that, if consumers were paying the real cost of producing leaded petrol, they would in fact be paying much more than the differential that is proposed by the government. I do not have the figures in front of me, but the differential would in fact become 10c to 15c to 20c because, as time goes on and the amount of leaded petrol produced by refineries becomes less and less, it becomes much more expensive to produce. So we are entering a period where, if there was not a cross-subsidy of leaded petroleum users, the costs of leaded petrol in fact will skyrocket beyond much more than the government is proposing. </PARA>

Unfortunately, the opposition does not have one. It has pursued a continual negative approach since the election.

Certainly there will be a market rate that is different around Australia. I certainly know about that in Tasmania. If honourable senators think petrol is expensive on the mainland then they should come to Tasmania and have a look at the price: it is the most expensive petrol in Australia. But the government cannot have a different policy on pricing between country and city dwellers. It cannot do that constitutionally, let alone practically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence from overseas suggests that a price differential will speed up the phase out of leaded petrol considerably. That is the basis of the government's policy. The cost of this measure is a small price to pay for the welfare of Australians. Taxes are not imposed simply to raise revenue. There are other reasons for having taxation, aside from the obvious need to raise government revenue. There are tax measures that can be introduced that have a positive environmental effect and positive health considerations. This is one of those issues where the health consideration outweighs other considerations. There is the need to ensure that we have a consistent phase out of leaded petrol because of the investment requests and considerations of the oil companies. I do not always subscribe to the requests of the oil companies, but I do not want to see the oil companies having to be involved in unnecessarily changing over their machinery used in oil production at a cost of $300 million to $500 million. It would be an absurd policy to impose on the oil refineries.</PARA>

It is based on sound, medical and health grounds which we all agree on, except that the opposition, as usual, does not have a positive suggestion but purely a negative approach. They say that they agree that we have to get rid of lead from petrol. I pose the question through you, Mr Deputy President: how would those opposite go about it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the matter of public importance tonight, I want to deal with three issues: firstly, the environmental aspects of this price difference between leaded and unleaded petrol; secondly, to look at the reasons which lie behind today's petrol price increase and to ask of both the government and the opposition what contribution they have made to that increase; and, thirdly, to suggest ways in which the impact&mdash;I do want Senator Sherry to hear this&mdash;on low income earners may be overcome particularly in relation to that differential between city and country drivers. The case for a price differential, as a number of honourable senators have mentioned, favouring unleaded petrol is beyond doubt on public health grounds. Study after study has attested to the fact that lead emissions from petrol are directly related to neurological problems and to lowered IQ in children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, children living in the inner city areas are most at risk. Children growing up in Sydney have been the worst affected because of the high population densities in the inner city of Sydney and because the lead limit in Sydney is higher than the lead limit in Melbourne, the other city of comparable size. Last year RMIT published a study into lead exposure in Australia. It said that it was easy to be complacent about lead exposure when it was thought that the adverse health effects were associated with a blood level of 25 micrograms per decilitre of blood or higher. If we take that measure, only about 2 per cent of Australian children have levels that high. However, the report goes on to say that the situation is now different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the National Health and Medical Research Council adopted a specific goal, to achieve for all Australians a blood level of below 10 micrograms per decilitre. The National Health and Medical Research Council stated that there is a particular urgency in reaching this level in children aged 1 to 4 years because of the adverse effects of lead exposure on intellectual development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RMIT report found that a staggering 44 per cent of Australian children aged between nought and four years have blood lead levels above 10 micrograms. This is appalling. Nearly half of Australian children under the age of four years have blood lead levels above the NHMRC goal. The report also said that adverse health effects occur at very low levels, so that even a level of 10 micrograms may not be safe. As the lowering of lead in petrol has been strongly linked overseas to a reduction in blood lead levels, the report called for a lowering of the lead limit in petrol to 0.15 grams per litre. For some time many European countries have set a limit of 0.15 grams per litre of lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also called for more accurate costing on lowering the lead limit to 0.026 grams per litre. This is the lead limit in petrol in the United States where it was adopted as far back as 1986. The report said that even if the costs of achieving this United States lead level are high in Australia, it may be considered justifiable on social justice or human rights grounds. After all, we are talking about the right of 44 per cent of Australian children living now to develop their full human and intellectual potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have pushed hard for the US standard to be adopted in Australia. However, last year the government negotiated for a lead limit of only 0.2 grams per litre. This still leaves many children at risk. Unfortunately, the introduction of a price differential was very badly handled by the government. What should have been a positive public health measure ended up as, and being seen as, a revenue grab by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, a price differential of 1c per litre has been introduced. Every study indicates, and the industry knows, that this is simply not enough to encourage a switch by consumers to unleaded petrol. The differential should have been more distinct and should have been introduced in one go in order to cause the maximum effect on consumer behaviour. The incremental nature of the price rise means that consumers are less likely to notice the rise and therefore less likely to look for alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A well-funded and effective community education campaign will be needed to ensure that people make the necessary move to unleaded petrol, and thereby lower the risk of lead poisoning to Australia's young children. In the past few days the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, has launched such a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave my concern with environmental health, I also point out that the Australian Democrats were able to negotiate with the government late last year for a lead abatement package, a subsidy for the production of ethanol, so that an ethanol and petroleum mix&mdash;known popularly as gasohol&mdash;could be introduced so that people using leaded petrol could switch to unleaded petrol and thus achieve the goal that we all have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment Australia is facing a very attractive proposition in the record wheat harvest. However, the problem is what to do with our wheat, particularly that which we cannot sell. I compliment those who run the refinery at Manildra which has been able to increase production and use some of that wheat harvest to produce ethanol, which is non-pollutant and avoids the use of leaded petrol. That also creates jobs in value adding to primary industry, which is an objective of all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to address the reasons for the impact of today's petrol price increase. One central factor should not be forgotten. The petrol tax increase would not have been necessary if the Liberal-National Party coalition had not supported the government in introducing cuts in income tax. There is no doubt that the petrol tax rises were introduced because of the fiscal necessity to pay for the income tax cuts. The coalition must bear its share of the blame for increased petrol prices currently being borne by all Australians, including low income earners and particularly those in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission is currently conducting an inquiry on petrol pricing mechanisms and is due to report in July this year. The Democrats will certainly be pushing for a significant reduction in this unfair burden on rural people. Having said this, however, let us not forget the role of the government in foisting this tax on low income earners. Combining this with the government's record on further reducing the adequacy of our social welfare safety net, it seems that the Australian Labor Party has little interest in assisting those at the bottom of the heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address the very real and quite unfair differences in petrol prices between the country and the city. This would tie in with another need to encourage development in regional areas and reduce the infrastructure burden in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest three ways of looking at this differential: first, improved subsidising of petrol freight costs; secondly, compensation of costs through tax and the social security system; and, thirdly, direct petrol pricing matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address the petroleum product freight subsidisation scheme which has been around in a number of forms since 1965. It subsidises the freight cost of petrol to remote areas. Currently it only subsidises those freight costs which are greater than 13.5c per litre, which helps virtually no-one. The PSA figures reveal that about 200 locations in Australia attract the subsidy. It currently costs the government some $3 million a year. At one stage in 1981-82 this differential was only 0.44c per litre and the cost that year was $147.5 million. If 5c were lopped off the differential, paralleling the 5c per litre unleaded petrol excise increase, a rough estimate is that the cost to the budget would be in the order of $20 million to $25 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second method is an increase in the zone rebate for income tax and remote area allowance of DSS recipients. Zone rebates are currently $57, $338 and $1,173, depending on the degree of remoteness, plus a greater amount for other rebates, such as dependent spouse, et cetera. These amounts were increased by 25 per cent in the 1992-93 budget. In 1990-91, 364,000 taxpayers were eligible for one of these rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remote area allowance uses the same zones, with the exception that the people in zone B are not eligible, and is $15 each a fortnight for couples or $17.50 for individuals, with an extra $7 per child. Currently 44,000 people are in receipt of this. Very roughly, the areas covered are most of Western Australia and South Australia; all of the Northern Territory; parts of Queensland north of Mackay and west of Emerald; only the far west of New South Wales and Tasmania; and none of Victoria or the ACT. Zone B people are not eligible for remote area allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the people in New South Wales and Queensland, except for Cloncurry-Mt Isa and north of Mossman, would not be eligible for the remote area allowance. Rough costings provided by the library indicate that each 10 per cent increase in the base zone rebates would cost around $10 million. Increasing the remote area allowance by $1 a fortnight would cost $1 million to $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in which we would see some possibility is in the pricing mechanisms and controls. With the Industry Commission inquiry under way it might be difficult to get any agreement to change anything before its report comes down. However, we should still put forward our position. I refer to the area of wholesale petrol prices. There are varying views about the role that current wholesale pricing mechanisms have in keeping rural petrol costs too high and city prices too low. Under the Trade Practices Act oil companies cannot set retail prices at service stations. However, the area pricing mechanism used at refineries now sets different wholesale prices for dealers, depending upon the region in which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lately, we have received requests for rural organisations to support terminal gate pricing. Basically, this would mean a universal price for each customer buying from a specific terminal. Some people suggest that this should be extended to inland storage depots rather than simply coastal refineries. The oil companies do not like terminal gate pricing, and they say it would not be possible to maintain the integrity of the price. I am afraid that the same could be said about the current system. Surely no-one would want to say that the integrity of the price is being maintained at the current time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not seeking parity of pricing between metropolitan and rural regions. There will always be a difference in transport costs. But the price difference is over and above the transport costs; it is up to 20 cents a litre. People in rural areas are paying the price for the discounting occurring in the cities. The question is: why is the petrol price difference in rural Australia greater than the transport cost of the petrol? We need to introduce the terminal gate system, which reduces the price so that the difference is only that of the transport cost. That will provide a stimulus for rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that the Kelty report should have tackled. And that leads me to ask: what was the use of the Kelty report? All it suggested was an increase in fuel tax. It did not even bother to investigate a system of price reduction. Kelty, probably under government instructions, came up with no more of an idea than a simple increase in tax; that is how he was going to stimulate business and create expansion in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>

As someone who was outside the parliament at the time, it seemed to me that there was a very real sense in the community of vulnerability; a feeling that people's livelihoods were really on the line at that election. It seemed that the country had gone into a deep depression: the labour markets had collapsed; industries and small businesses had toppled over one after the other.

Opinion polls are useful tools from time to time, particularly as we draw closer to an election.

Every argument that the coalition has put in the chamber this evening could have been put to the electorate of Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some experience of that division because it was my privilege to be John Kerin's campaign director when Gough Whitlam retired from parliament in the early part of 1978. I remember the Werriwa by-election vividly. In September of 1978, Labor was still in the political doldrums nationally as a consequence of the debacle of 1975 and as reinforced by the heavy electoral defeat of December 1977. There had not been much good news on the federal political landscape. For example, in the Cunningham by-election of 1977, Labor did not poll well. There was a movement to Labor of about one per cent when Stewart West replaced the late Rex Connor, but by any criterion Cunningham had not been a particularly successful by-election contest. All that changed when Werriwa came along. </PARA>

I remember the campaign and the issues; I remember Mr Kerin starting at 5 a.m. and going right through to midnight. We took it very seriously. We proceeded to put an enormous hole in the Fraser government for the first time since Mr Fraser was appointed to office by Sir John Kerr on 11 November. People wrote about it as such and it was interpreted as such. The political conclusion was drawn that Labor was on the way back. And so it proved to be in the ensuing 1980 election when Bill Hayden made enormous inroads and laid the foundations for Labor to be returned to power in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>

In terms of commitment, the government consistently honours its undertakings. We saw that at the end of last year on industrial relations, Mabo and APEC; and the economy is coming good.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I do hope you will look kindly on me during this debate, unlike Senator Panizza. The simple fact is that in terms of making judgments on whether or not the Labor government keeps its commitments, we had a by-election last Saturday in Werriwa. The coalition could have made these issues of some relevance to the electorate if there was any foundation to the suggestion that is inherent in Senator Vanstone's proposition; but there is not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy, in terms of the commitments given by the Labor government in the lead-up to the general election, during the election and subsequently, is growing strongly; as is employment. We are coming off a low inflation base; a base of low interest rates. Governments of different persuasions have endeavoured to achieve that for more than two decades. This has been accomplished exactly as we as a government said that it would be achieved. It is an excellent performance by any criteria devised and employed, and by any comparison within the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We kept our commitments on Mabo and native title&mdash;and I am very proud of that. We did not walk away from them.

Every commitment we gave we honoured; right through to enterprise bargaining. We were absolutely determined to see the industrial relations system taking another step forward with Minister Brereton. We kept the commitments. Again, all we had was absolute opposition and negativism. No constructive alternative was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We kept our commitments on APEC. The Seattle leaders forum took APEC a step further. The Jakarta leaders forum will take it another step forward. We have kept our commitments on health. A restructuring is going on within the health portfolio at the moment that will mean a better delivery of health services for Australians, regardless of where they live and regardless of income. It is being achieved in a generally cooperative framework, exactly as we said we would do. These are commitments that have been maintained and honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from Senator McGauran, who followed Senator Woodley, the tired old rhetoric, `Ignore the issues and the government, just bash the Democrats'. At one stage he says that Senator Woodley's speech has served to totally discredit him. Five minutes later he is calling upon Senator Sherry to read the same speech closely. The honourable senator cannot have it both ways, even by the logic of the National Party. A document cannot totally discredit someone&mdash;and I would be interested in Senator Kemp's sophistry on this point&mdash;and five minutes later be worthy of the government's close and enduring scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard that the Werriwa by-election was a test of whether commitments had been honoured. The government passed it with flying colours. It will be very interesting to see what happens to the Fahey government in New South Wales in a very short time in the North Shore by-election, and how the question of commitments will be judged by the people of the North Shore. In terms of the political health of the government, as a consequence of the March election it has seldom been better. The political health opposite is another story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the economic health of the nation is sound and growing better. Growth of four per cent, as the Prime Minister made clear, is now achievable. Not only is the Prime Minister citing a figure of four per cent, but also leading people in industry, such as Mr John Prescott of BHP, are saying four per cent is achievable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing this matter of public importance regarding Labor's broken election promises, I was particularly interested in the selective memories of Senator Sherry and Senator Loosley. I would refresh Senator Sherry's memory regarding the actual statements that were made about not raising taxes and not introducing further taxes. I refer him to some of these statements. At the Press Club on 19 August 1992, Mr Dawkins declared:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Mr Dawkins told parliament on 16 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise that this will be achieved without resort to any new taxes, let alone the imposition of a crushing tax on the necessities of everyday life and almost everything else consumed by Australians and their families.</PARA>
<PARA>How does that add up to a new petrol tax? He also assured parliament on 15 September that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can pay for our personal tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was indicated by my colleague Senator McGauran, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 19 November 1992 Mr Keating was categoric. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>What is this if not putting up tax? I am not surprised that Senator Loosley wished to hark back to the glories of the Cunningham by-election. He certainly did not have anything to relish in the results last Saturday in the Werriwa by-election where there was a swing against his party of 11 1/2 per cent on the primary vote. This can be compared with an average of a 4.7 per cent swing against the government in the last four by-elections. If those opposite call that passing the by-election with flying colours, I would be interested to see their version of a defeat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer Senator Loosley to Senator Evans's extremely interesting statements today during question time in reply to a question asked by Senator Hill. I will be dealing with some of these statements individually. Senator Evans said that the new tax is an important part of the deficit reduction strategy. He also said that the tax creates the incentive for people who drive cars which use leaded petrol to switch cars&mdash;that is, to move from using leaded petrol to unleaded petrol. For most of those people that is a fiscal impossibility. He also mentioned the health factor, which I will deal with in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with this question from the point of view of the claims that have been made by the government and the inherent contradictions in what it is proposing. For instance, the government has claimed that the lead level is too high and therefore we should make the tax on leaded petrol punitive to stop people from using so much of this fuel. The health and community services department in Victoria says that the lead in the blood of Victorian children has halved since 1979, and that nearly 100 per cent of Victorian children have lead levels in their blood below that required by safety measures. Not only that, it says that the main danger to children from lead is through eating lead-based paints in pre-1960 homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the chief health officer of that very same department, Dr Rouch, said that as little as 10 per cent of the lead in people's bodies comes through the air. So it seems unlikely that our children are in great danger through leaded petrol. The lead content of at least Victorian petrol has been cut over the years. Since 1979 the average blood lead level for a Victorian child has more than halved to 5.4 micrograms per 100 millilitres. Lead is not as much of a problem in country and rural areas, yet rural areas are going to be hardest hit by the fuel tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal next with Senator Evans's claim that by taxing leaded petrol, more owners will change to cars that use unleaded petrol. The contradiction in this is that taxing the fuel used by older vehicles will reduce their value. Therefore, it will be very much harder for the owners to trade them in on unleaded petrol vehicles. The cars used by struggling families will usually be older and therefore more likely to use leaded fuel. The market value of such cars will drop and fewer people will be able to trade up to a newer car. More than 50 per cent of Australia's cars on the road today are at least nine years old compared with only 35 per cent a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Loosley does not think this is a fundamental problem, I can assure him that for more than 50 per cent of car owners it is. How are they going to trade in a value depleted car that uses lead fuel on a new unleaded petrol model? It simply is not possible. Leaded petrol will remain at least 20 per cent of petrol purchased until the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fortnight ago I pulled into a service station in Warrnambool&mdash;a very good representative example of regional Australia. While I was parked in my unleaded fuel car, three cars pulled into the service station. Each of those cars used leaded fuel. I can assure Senator Loosley and Senator Sherry that if they took the trouble to move around in regional Australia, they would find far more leaded petrol cars than unleaded petrol cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stabilising the price of fuel and not taxing it further would make it much easier for consumers to save money and to switch to new cars. Rural Australians already pay more for fuel&mdash;in some places up to 15c more than those in the city.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A further increase in fuel costs is not going to encourage them to buy new cars. So I hope that that disposes of what was said by Senator Evans today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section of the population that drives leaded petrol cars is made up of older people who need their cars to get to medical appointments and to make their weekly shopping trips. They are unlikely, on pensionable incomes, to be able to drive newer cars. It is these groups who are least able to afford new cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third claim that has been made by the government is that it will use part of this tax increase to educate the public to use unleaded petrol where possible. The unleaded differential is supposed to bring in $100 million in a full year but something like only $4.5 million of this will be spent on education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the education that is proposed may encourage drivers of older cars to use unleaded petrol in leaded cars and to unwittingly damage their cars. No less an authority than the chief engineer of the RACV, Mr Ron de Forest, was quoted in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> as saying&mdash;and honourable senators will excuse my lack of mechanical knowledge:</PARA>

<PARA>So, people who are not aware of the finer points of using unleaded petrol in leaded engines may ultimately do great damage to their cars and end up having very expensive repairs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive director of the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, Mr Bob Davison, also estimated that cars which have engine modifications will be unable to withstand the impact of unleaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the claims which have been made by the recent Kelty regional report which saw value adding in food processing&mdash;particularly in some key regions of Victoria, such as Bendigo and the Goulburn Valley&mdash;as being very important in the future to strengthen the farm sector and help exploit Asian market opportunities. If the costs that are inherent in the fuel tax increase are passed on, not only will consumers in those areas pay an extra $2 to $3 for the average shopping trolley of consumables, but also every 1c increase in the fuel excise costs the farming sector $26.8 million and adds $23.3 million to the cost of the food processing sector, $6.9 million to the mining sector and $9 million to the forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, a fortnight ago I visited the shire of Deakin, centred on the town of Tongala in northern Victoria. That area in the Goulburn Valley was particularly pinpointed by the Kelty regional report as one that can see a glowing future in the area of food processing. How can that area progress if it is immediately hit by increased transport costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These industries have already been hit by the 3c increase in the budget and they face another 1c to 2c round of increases in August. Accounting for only the 5c increase in diesel and unleaded fuel excise this represents, it means increasing the cost burden on these industries by $330 million in just 12 months. The government feels that there will be only a 0.09 per cent inflationary effect from this price increase, but it does not examine the effect industry by industry or state by state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Transport Federation has estimated it will cost an extra five per cent to transport a raw product such as fruit, vegetables or other grocery type products to the manufacturer. It will cost a further five per cent to transport the manufactured product to the wholesaler, and possibly a further five per cent from the wholesaler to the retailer. This does not augur well for our export industries, particularly in the area of clean food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last claim I would like to deal with is the myth that fuel excise contributes to road maintenance. In 10 years of Labor government the fuel tax has increased from 6c a litre to 26.5c a litre. From 1981 to 1982, the coalition government spent 70 per cent of excise on road funding, but the Labor government has diluted the excise to such an extent that this year only 12.1 per cent of the excise collected will be spent on roads. The amount of excise forecast to be spent on roads in three years time will to fall to only 8.7 per cent&mdash;disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans mentioned in his answer to Senator Hill today that the petrol tax is an important part of the deficit reduction strategy. For `deficit reduction strategy' read `new tax', and a new tax that will have a disastrous impact on low income earners. These low income earners cannot afford yet another hike in their living expenses. They are dependent on older leaded fuel cars to get to work and to transport their families. This tax is yet another blow to struggling families in their efforts to maintain a reasonable standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a recent development, I draw the Senate's attention to the statement issued yesterday by the Assistant Treasurer, George Gear MP, which indicated that in the 1993 budget the government resolved to encourage the use of unleaded petrol. Accordingly, he has revoked the 1985 directive which indicated that leaded and unleaded petrol should be identically priced. By this stratagem, I would imagine that there is a further direction for the price to be increased without further reference to the Prices Surveillance Authority. In other words, it is setting this differential in concrete so that the government can move in this area without further reference to anyone. For those reasons, I consider that this petrol tax increase will have a disastrous impact on low income earners, and is yet another indication of Labor's broken election promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was trying to say that the coalition parties have a hide to claim to speak on behalf of low income earners. I will relate that very deliberately to the last election campaign, which is referred to in the matter of public importance. I believe it is perfectly proper to show the hypocrisy of the opposition in criticising the government in this situation when, in that very election campaign, the program of the opposition&mdash;the coalition's Fightback manifesto&mdash;promised the most massive shift of income from the poor to the rich ever proposed in this country. That promise was based additionally on a movement away from the traditional progressive taxation system that we have in this country to one which would have imposed additional tax on every low paid income earner in this country. I refer, in addition, to those other matters that were part of the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran and other opposition senators want to concentrate solely on the petrol issue. But I read this MPI in a broader way to say that this Labor government implements its election promises. I assert that the beginning of the matter is such that we have implemented our promises to the people of Australia as a result of that election campaign. I certainly draw attention to the fact that the opposition is fixated on that election campaign and on the disaster that that election campaign was to the Liberal and National parties. It has not stopped because, as Senator Loosley pointed out, that confusion about policy that is characteristic of this resolution was reflected in the very last election we had. I refer to the Werriwa by-election only a week ago in which the Liberal candidate not only referred to Macquarie Fields as a ghetto&mdash;in other words, the place where underprivileged people live&mdash;but also he was still running on the consumption tax. The Liberals had not told him that at least most of the party was not following that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leader of the opposition in waiting, Senator Bishop, has a different policy formulation. She would disadvantage those same underprivileged people, who are referred to in the matter that is before us, by abolishing the capital gains tax as we now know it. That will be her contribution when she is leader. My colleague Senator Sherry has already said that the Liberal and National parties cry crocodile tears when they come in here and talk about low income earners. In contrast to this, this government is implementing its election promises. It is doing it consistently and keeping to a program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol situation consists of two issues. On the one hand we are talking about the environmental aspects and, on the other hand, about another part of our economic policy, namely, that if we are to control the deficit&mdash;and this government is doing that&mdash;then it has to do the difficult things. The opposition's difficulty is that it can only oppose; it cannot acknowledge that the government has to make difficult environmental and economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is concerned with the lead levels in the environment, as is Australia's premier health advisory body, the National Health and Medical Research Council. The federal government is showing national leadership by developing and implementing a national lead abatement strategy in cooperation with the states and territories. A sum of $37 million has been allocated for this purpose over four years. A national education program begins today that will be coordinated by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency. Ninety per cent of the lead in the atmosphere comes from vehicle emissions. The national lead and petrol round table conference, held in July 1993, agreed on a package of measures. These included reducing faster and to a lower level the amount of lead in petrol than had been previously planned. The round table conference also recommended a price differential favouring unleaded petrol, which is in line with successful practices overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one million vehicles in Australia that could switch to unleaded petrol straight away without any engine modification. That is the particular area the government wishes to target. The differential is designed to encourage people to switch to unleaded petrol. Solutions are being sought for vehicles that cannot easily make that switch. The differential amounts to an extra 40c to 60c per week for a family car, while the tax rebate for low income earners announced in the last budget amounted to about $3 a week. That highlights the difference between the government and the opposition. We agonised over protecting those low income people and came up with that solution. The government wishes  to be fair, to achieve its environmental standards, and to make sure that the lower paid people are compensated. </PARA>

Contributions to a considerable part of this debate, especially by Senator Troeth but also by others, have perpetuated some of the myths that surround the issue of the fuel that is used in our cars in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Childs accurately said in his remarks that there are approximately a million cars in Australia that could switch from using leaded petrol to unleaded petrol without damage to their engines and without any alteration in their performances. Since 1 January 1986 new cars have been required to be capable of running on unleaded petrol. In many cases that has meant that manufacturers have fitted catalytic converters as well as slightly differently tuned engines. In other cases the vehicles have been designed from the very start to use the lower octane fuel and they have had engine head designs which have not required the lubrication that is provided by lead in petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What ought to be questioned immediately is the expression `a leaded fuel car'. There is no such thing as a leaded fuel car in Australia. There is not one motor vehicle in the whole of Australia that is a leaded fuel car. There may be a great number of vehicles that require the high octane that the additive lead brings to the fuel; there may be a considerable number of motor vehicles in Australia that require upper cylinder lubrication that is provided to the valve seats by the addition of lead. But lead is not the only additive that brings a higher octane rating to standard fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most useful and most convenient additive to provide a higher octane rating, such as is provided by lead, is in fact ethanol. That was recognised in the negotiations which the Democrats held with the government during the budget process. The Democrats negotiated a bounty of 18c a litre to be paid on the production of ethanol as fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiations that produced that bounty have spawned a considerable expansion in the ethanol producing industry in Australia. That must be recognised as a significant contribution to employment prospects in rural Australia. The harvest of Australia's largest single wheat crop has been recorded by the Manildra group just this season, and a considerable amount of that wheat will be used to produce the raw materials to produce ethanol fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ethanol fuel is mixed with unleaded petrol to provide a higher octane fuel which is suitable for use in pre-1986 cars and other cars which may require a higher octane fuel. That is the answer which has been ignored in this debate. It is the answer which should be immediately apparent to anybody who takes the trouble to find out why it is we are told that we need lead in fuel. We do not. We need a higher octane additive in some fuels for some vehicles. Ethanol has provided that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that the people who wish to contribute to debates such as this take in the basic technical knowledge that will give them that enlightenment. I am disappointed that this debate has been predicated upon the notion that there are vehicles which require leaded fuel. There are none. They require a higher octane fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer has been provided by the negotiations which were concluded by the Democrats, and I am proud to have been part of that. I just wish that those who criticise the situation that we have now where a differential has been provided in leaded fuel versus unleaded fuel would encourage people to switch to alternatives. My only disappointment is that on this very day it is difficult to find that alternative fuel throughout Australia. I will be trying to ensure that it is more readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remind ourselves of what Senator Childs rightly said: there are still a million cars which could switch to unleaded fuel without danger today. While that does not solve the problem completely, I think the best solution is provided by the addition of ethanol to the fuel. It is working. There are many service stations throughout New South Wales where the fuel is available, and the number of service stations is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The production of ethanol as an additive to fuel, as a gasohol combination, is increasing. I would encourage all honourable senators to make it their business to inform people that this is the best way of going about saving people from the additional expense of paying the differential between unleaded and leaded fuel and to encourage people to ask for it so as to increase demand throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supply is increasing markedly in New South Wales and I suggest it will not be long before it will be readily available in Queensland. As a matter of fact, at various times over the past 70 or 80 years this fuel has been available throughout Queensland. It has proved to be a very satisfactory additive, one which gives an alternative market to sugar producers as well. But not only sugar producers benefit; rural Australia in its entirety benefits because many crops can be used to produce this fuel. The most promising one at the moment is the waste woody weeds which are such a problem in western New South Wales. The cellulosis material from those weeds has been successfully proven to be capable of producing a very low cost ethanol and that, combined with the waste material from wheat starch processing, really does give a promising situation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I presented this report to the President just before Christmas and it has now been formally tabled. The report is more critical of policy and administration than is common in committee reports. I regretted the need to be so critical but the criticism was fully justified on the basis of the evidence available to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much regret that the government adopted the policy of performance pay. I should point out, however, that it was also strongly supported in this policy at the time by the opposition, which made it difficult for contrary views to gain currency. I hope that the government will now pay particular regard to this report and decide to abandon the scheme as the committee has recommended. If it does make such a decision, it will be greatly applauded, and I believe there will be immense relief throughout the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the committee found that there were fundamental conceptual problems with the system of performance pay adopted in the Australian Public Service and the scheme was never likely to achieve the objectives set for it. The prospects for success were further reduced by serious design faults and by faulty implementation, especially on the part of the central coordinating agencies&mdash;the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance and the Public Service Commission. It should be remembered that serious warnings were given in advance of precisely the types of problems which occurred. Two reports of the finance and public administration committee in 1990 stand up very well in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's conclusions in the present inquiry are summarised in chapter 7 of the report. Briefly, they are that the performance pay system is based on assumptions about motivation and the nature of work in organisations that are not valid or appropriate for much of the Australian Public Service. The system required a degree of precision in the measurement of individual contributions to organisational output which is not realistically attainable in many public sector agencies in either the short term or the long term. In the absence of that precision, the motivational effects sought from performance pay could not be achieved and, as a result, none of its objectives could be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as being unlikely to achieve its objectives, the performance pay system created a range of serious inequities and has been widely seen as divisive and destructive of team effort. Its link to staff appraisal detracted from the benefits potentially available from good appraisal systems in several ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of performance pay was also flawed. Appraisal systems were developed and implemented very hastily in most agencies. Typically, the appraisal systems were established in a matter of a few months and then immediately used to support the payment of bonuses, which was in contradiction of all the relevant theory and of common sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central support for implementation was manifestly inadequate. Performance pay was said to be directed at a major change in Public Service culture. However, the central agencies coordinating its introduction were given no additional resources to manage its implementation. As a result, they accepted little responsibility for implementation, presenting as their excuse the usual slogans about devolution. The committee concluded that the central agencies had misrepresented the concept of devolved responsibility for management. Devolution is acceptable as a management strategy only if it is properly matched with accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coordinating agencies developed a system which was then compulsorily applied to all departments and agencies. In doing so, they failed to design a system that could be expected to achieve its objectives; they failed to ensure that departments and agencies understood the system that had been designed; they failed to specify effective reporting and control systems and therefore failed to detect widespread departures from the letter and spirit of the system they had designed; and they underestimated the need for investment in implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main result of poor system design and faulty implementation of performance pay has been a widespread lack of acceptance of the system. The extent to which the official submissions of departments and agencies were critical of the policy aspects of performance pay was unprecedented in my years of experience as a member of parliamentary committees. While there were some supporters, the response from individual public servants and from outside observers was overwhelmingly negative. The committee notes in the report that the willingness of so many to comment frankly on the problems posed by performance pay was in the best tradition and the best interests of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's general conclusion was that nothing could be retrieved from the present scheme. If the government wishes to persist in seeking the objectives it sought through performance pay, it could do so more effectively by beginning again than by attempting to repair the present scheme. There are other ways of achieving the types of objectives sought through performance pay. The committee has provided a partial list of alternatives. The current round of agency bargaining provides an opportunity to explore such options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express the committee's thanks to the staff of the Australian National Audit Office and to its own staff. This inquiry required the collection of a large base of factual information very quickly. The audit office, which had begun an audit of performance pay independently of the committee, worked with the committee in conducting a major survey of departments and agencies, collecting and analysing basic information on their implementation of performance pay. The full results of the survey are printed as an appendix to the committee's report, while the committee and the audit office drew on it for their separate reviews and reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Use of the audit office in this way gave the committee access to expertise on survey design and additional analytical capacity as well as resolving possible problems related to individual privacy. This was a model of cooperation between a parliamentary committee and the audit office in which the independence of both was preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was very keen to finalise this report as quickly as possible so as to have its views considered in the agency bargaining process. The inquiry was completed to an unusually tight deadline, imposing heavy pressure on all who were involved. In conclusion, I again urge that the performance pay system in the Australian Public Service be abandoned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition members of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration endorse the criticisms of performance pay contained in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Performance pay</EMPHASIS>, which has just been tabled and summarised by committee chairman, Senator John Coates. We are strongly of the view that individual incentives are important and the Australian Public Service reforms should aim to create incentives for excellent performance. But our main concern with the performance pay system adopted in the Australian Public Service is that the incentives it creates will not have the desired effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the reasons for this? The reasons are that the system relies too heavily on subjective judgments of individual performance in the areas in which individual contributions cannot be properly measured. The whole logic of the system depends on its being widely accepted. There was never much of a chance that so subjective a scheme would ever be accepted. What little chance of acceptance did exist was lost through bad implementation. In fact, it is clear that performance pay was implemented as a backdoor pay rise in most agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 90 per cent of agencies pay performance bonuses to more than 90 per cent of their staff. The three coordinating agencies and the Australian National Audit Office were among the few departments or agencies which applied the system in the way that was intended. As a result, many of their staff can legitimately complain about the way in which they were treated. Much smaller proportions of the staff of the coordinating agencies and the Australian National Audit Office received bonuses and smaller proportions were rated at the higher levels of performance than in the public service as a whole. This is not because the average quality of staff in those agencies is lower but because most of the Public Service implemented performance pay almost as a general pay rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subjective element in the system has made it extremely unpopular. All members of the committee received many complaints from individual members of the public service. I can hardly remember a public service management change which has been so unpopular as this particular one. As the report makes clear, the committee received an unprecedented amount of criticism of the system from the heads of departments and agencies. I think it is particularly significant that agencies which have been generally well managed and which have implemented wide ranging, often painful reform in recent years were critical of the performance pay attitudes. And I have in mind here the Australian Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department in particular, and also the Treasury, which is surely the stronghold of economic rationalism. They expressed doubts about the theoretical basis for performance pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reached the conclusion that the criticism of performance pay within the public service is not just a hidebound resistance to change or self-serving in its nature. It reflects a genuine and widely held belief that the performance pay system adopted in the Australian public sector will not work. Coalition members of the committee who are with me tonight&mdash;Senators Kemp and Campbell&mdash;believe that steps should be taken to increase the flexibility of public service pay and conditions and to reward excellence, but we do not believe that the system of performance pay can meet those desirable objectives. We also have grave concerns about the accountability aspects of the system. Performance pay has been implemented with such secrecy that some agencies believed they could refuse access to performance pay records by the Auditor-General. In fact, the Auditor-General had to issue precepts under section 13 of the Audit Act to secure access to some of the records. This is apparently the first use of this power in the 93 years since federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several departments and agencies also failed initially to comply with requests to supply information for the survey conducted by the audit office for the committee and cited individual privacy as their reason. The Auditor-General has unquestioned access to taxation and social security records, to national security information and to the pay records of junior public servants. It is simply ludicrous to argue that the pay of senior public servants should be more secret than these. Reporting systems that were established to meet accountability concerns were also inadequate. The coordinating agencies eventually conceded this. When this is added to the resistance to proper audit scrutiny, accountability becomes a serious issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also important equity problems with the particular system of performance pay adopted in the Australian public sector. The scheme focuses on the individual rather than on the team, at a time when the Public Service Commission is emphasising teamwork as one of the most important management concepts. Most of the teams operating within the public service incorporate staff below the senior officer level who are not eligible to receive performance pay but who have contributed significantly to their supervisors' reward. Performance pay in such situations creates unfair differentials in the treatment of public servants in different employment classifications, in different work units within agencies and departments, and in different agencies. It is likely to be perceived as divisive and detrimental to the team as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was absolutely outraged to learn that there are proposals to extend the system to the senior ranks of the Defence Force in the same year that most junior ranks have lost access to significant assistance through the social security system. The committee was told that Social Security Amendment Act No. 2 of 1993 had the effect of reducing payments to some members of the Defence Force at private or equivalent level by up to $1,500 per annum at the same time that it is proposed to pay large performance bonuses to officers at lieutenant colonel level and above. Overall, this is an object lesson in bad policy design and implementation. I hope the government will take account of the committee's very important comments and recommendations in moving to a system for improving public service performance that we could all support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to commend all members of the team. I commend Senator Coates on the fair and bipartisan way in which he chaired the committee, and to join him in thanking the audit office and the committee staff who assisted in the inquiry. The very useful survey that was conducted for the committee involved a great deal of extra staff time and work and was completed to a very tight deadline. It is a good example of how the audit office and parliamentary committees can work together. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to this report. I concur with the remarks of my colleague Senator Watson and with many of the remarks of Senator Coates. There are only two points I wish to make because the other points have been well made. The first point is that this is an excellent example of what a Senate committee can do. Senator Coates was quite right to draw our attention to the way in which the committee worked. We took wide ranging evidence from many departments and individuals. The evidence, as Senator Watson and Senator Coates have said, was overwhelmingly against the system which has been imposed. The committee came down with a report to which all members were prepared to append their names. Perhaps given the wide disparity of views which exist on this committee, that in itself is some particular achievement. It is a good example of the way Senate committees can work. I also join in paying compliments to the staff of the committee and, in particular, Peter Hamburger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is one of the few areas in which I differ slightly from Senator Coates. He said that the Liberal-National parties supported performance pay. I do not recall them being a party before the election to the design of this particular scheme. This particular scheme was drummed up, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, between the government and the public sector unions. That the public sector unions ever agreed to this scheme, which delivered massive increases to the most senior and well-paid levels of the public service, and fairly minimal rises to the lower ranks, is something which I find beyond belief. I believe the evidence that was given by the secretary of the Public Service Union is interesting in this regard. He was critical of the government, and I think he was quite right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I think its own performance was a very poor one. The scheme was rushed in. As Senator Coates so well said, it was a poorly designed scheme. As Senator Watson said, it was designed to deliver a rise before an election. As a consequence, we are left with a scheme which is unworkable. If left in place, I believe it has the capacity to corrupt many of the most worthwhile features of the public service, and that is what worries me. It is important that the government take on board the recommendations of this committee. Hopefully, we will see a scheme which deals with the problems we have raised in this report so that the traditions of the public service and its accountability are not compromised as I believe they have been compromised by this particular scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I want to make some brief remarks on the excellent and timely inquiry into performance pay, a system which has been rightly criticised by all political parties in this report. Undoubtedly, the performance pay scheme was introduced hastily. The committee report goes into some detail about not only the failure of the scheme, as implemented, but also the failure of the policy implementation process. The report makes it clear that, to have an effective performance pay system, far more time should have been allowed for its implementation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Performance pay was implemented in such a way as to ensure its failure. Departmental managers were not allowed adequate time to ensure a process of assessment that encourages performance. Hence, performance pay has met with both success and failure across the Australian Public Service&mdash;less problems in some of the smaller agencies and greater problems in the larger departments. Performance pay has created enormous morale problems&mdash;rivalries set up between and in departments, which has not helped to create a more efficient and productive public sector, which all parties would like to see. I know that Senator Coates is personally committed to increasing efficiency in the public sector, probably for different reasons from me, but at least we both seek to achieve the same end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians are served by having an Australian federal government and a public sector that provides efficient and cost effective service to the Australian community. It is no use having a public sector that unnecessarily chews up taxpayers' dollars because not only does the public not get the service it is entitled to, but it also pays too much for it. The lower the taxation rate, the more jobs are created and the better Australia will be for it and the better we will be able to provide for Australians who are less better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the failures of performance pay is that it is totally internal&mdash;it is very much an inward looking scheme that fails to relate to the way the Public Service actually serves the public. I am pleased to say that, in its next inquiry, the committee will focus on how the Public Service serves the public&mdash;the interface between the Australian public and the Public Service. Parliament often spends a lot of time concentrating on the interface between the senior executive service and lower levels of the Public Service. While that is very important, in the end the interface between the taxpayer and the Public Service is often forgotten. So I look forward to the next inquiry of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the entire performance pay scheme seemed to pay no cognisance to the level of service provided. That was one of the performance criteria that was not taken into account. Also, the inquiry into performance pay showed that the implementation of performance pay was particularly expensive in terms of administration. Indeed, it is very hard to add up the administration costs because a lot of the costs were chewed up in normal administrative affairs. However, the administration costs were particularly expensive&mdash;as a percentage of the total cost of the scheme, performance pay was a lot lower than it could have been because a lot of the costs were chewed up by administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a by-product of the inquiry in analysing its cost to the Australian taxpayer, another factor that came to my attention was an issue about which I made some public comments a couple of weeks ago in a press release which showed what had happened to public sector employment over the past few years. We have seen what happened with the performance pay inquiry. I was keen to pursue the related issue of pay in the public sector as a whole. Interestingly, I think it was the Australian Public Service bulletin that came out towards the end of last year that showed some very interesting employment trends in the senior ranks of the public sector generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On closer examination of those trends we found that the annual salaries of employees in the public sector had increased by $468 million in each of the last four financial years, even though the total number of employees of the Australian Public Service has decreased. During the last four years there has been a decrease of 13,712 employees at the ASO1 and ASO2 levels. However, there has been an increase in excess of 20,000 employees at the senior levels. So the service has dropped off 13,000 employees in its lower levels and reduced the salaries at those levels by $325 million but accorded its employees at the higher levels a massive increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, to use a cliche, we are seeing fewer indians and more chiefs in the Public Service. As the Public Service drops its employees off at the lower levels, it brings in more employees at the higher levels and increases the salary bill, including performance pay of $43.8 million in the last financial year. The total salary bill in the Public Service, not including the SES level but above the ASO1 and ASO2 levels, was $468 million&mdash;nearly half a billion dollars in this financial year alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear the Keating Labor government talk about making cuts in the Public Service. Today we saw a strike in Senator McMullan's department, the Department of Administrative Services, because of this culling of people in the Public Service. However, the government is cutting the number of employees at the lower levels but increasing the number at higher levels. For every person the government puts off at a lower level, it puts on another one at a higher level, clearly increasing the salary bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to focus on efficiency in the Public Service. We need to ensure that performance is enhanced in the public sector, that we have the most efficient public sector. We need to focus the attention of the parliament and the executive government on seeking those efficiencies, on ensuring that service is enhanced. Undoubtedly, the government has made a number of good reforms in the Public Service&mdash;we cannot carp by saying that the government has stuffed everything up. There is no doubt that this government has made some significant advances in public sector management and reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, after a lengthy and detailed inquiry, with the great assistance of the Australian National Audit Office, the unanimous decision of the committee was that the performance pay scheme has met almost none of the original criteria. As Senator Coates said, the committee strongly recommends the abandonment of performance pay and its replacement with a system that meets the criteria and policy objectives set out in the report. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act (Committee) was established on 13 March 1991 and its principal report, making 120 recommendations, was tabled on 24 November, 1992. A total of 1031 submissions was received and 18 public hearings held. Major written and oral submissions were made by the Family Court of Australia, the Family Law Council, the Family Law Section of the Law Council of Australia, Council of Social Welfare Ministers, Marriage Counselling Organisations, National Committee on Violence Against Women and Legal Aid Commissions. In addition, evidence was given and submissions made by individual practitioners, and organisations representing both men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 September 1992, the Committee received a further reference on the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia but had not finalised its consideration when the Parliament was prorogued. After the election, a new Committee was appointed to examine that issue and the operation and effectiveness of the Child Support Scheme. The new Committee is currently working on these two references.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report of the Committee will form the basis for the most significant changes to the Family Law Act since the introduction of no fault divorce in 1975. The scope of the Report is wide ranging and the changes it recommends offer a significant opportunity to remedy some of the intractable problems that plague the Family Law Act today. The Government thanks the Committee for its most comprehensive report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This response is not considering recommendations where funding is required. Those are matters that arise for consideration in the context of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report covers the following main areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mediation and Other Forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government proposes to shift the entire focus of the Family Law Act from litigation to non-adversarial dispute resolution mechanisms, as practised by the Family Court and the community sector, so that partners are encouraged to develop and agree on solutions rather than have them imposed by others. When the Family Law Act was introduced in 1975 the then Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy, stated that it would be a system which should not enquire into the cause of marital breakdown, would have simple procedures and be inexpensive. It is clear that this great vision has not been realised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the system is complex, costly and focuses too narrowly on traditional litigation. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR), achieved at a greatly reduced cost, produces an agreed outcome, which is likely to be more acceptable to the parties, therefore also likely to attract greater compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Family Studies estimates that one marriage in three will end in divorce. In the last calendar year, there were 45,665 dissolution applications, 24,174 of which involved children. It is therefore imperative that we develop a system which can provide an outcome that is more acceptable to the divorcing couple and also assists in the re-establishment of their lives after separation, whether children are involved or not. While there will ultimately always be a place for litigation in dispute resolution even in family matters, the Government believes that a far greater number of disputes can be resolved by mediation and other ADR mechanisms. This view was shared by the Committee. The separating couple should have a choice whether to resolve their difficulties by ADR or litigation. The Government recognises, however, that mediation is not appropriate where there is a serious power imbalance especially in circumstances where there is family violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Funding of the Family Court Counselling Service and Approved Marriage Counselling Organisations:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that the Family Court Counselling Service be sufficiently resourced to provide both a range of new services and greater capacity to deal with its existing workload. The Committee also recommended the provision of additional resources to community based marriage counselling organisations for marriage counselling and endorsed the greater use of ADR in the community. The Government accepts the thrust of the Committee's recommendations as essential to achieving the shift of focus to ADR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Guardianship, Custody &amp; Access</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made a number of important recommendations addressing the issues of custody, guardianship and access. The Committee was not, however, convinced that a change in the existing terminology of `custody, guardianship and access' would reduce disputes between parents and it did not have sufficient evidence before it about a change in approach to the United Kingdom system under the Children Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that the current concepts and terminology are undoubtedly a source of many of the ongoing difficulties between separated parents as it fosters a notion of "property" in children. Under the Children Act 1989 (UK), each parent is assigned, through a parenting plan, specified obligations and responsibilities for the care and development of the child, such obligations diminishing as the child approaches the age of 18. The Court is only empowered to make an order relating to the child's place of residence or contact with a parent where parents have failed to agree. The Family Law Council in its report "Patterns of Parenting after Separation", tabled 25 June 1992, examined and reported favourably on the Children Act 1989 (UK) and similar developments in other overseas jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is attracted to the UK approach but, in light of the Committee's reticence, believes a further assessment of the UK approach is required before making a final decision. The Attorney-General has therefore asked the Family Law Council to report by March 1994 on the operation of the UK approach so that an assessment of the desirability of a change along those lines should be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enforcement of Access Orders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that the Family Court is underutilising its powers to enforce access orders and that this is the cause of widespread community dissatisfaction. The Government accepts the Committee's recommendations for improving enforcement, including the proposal that the Family Law Council monitor the enforcement of access orders. To reduce the incidence of disputes at access handover, the Government will examine whether institutions unoccupied at weekends, such as child care centres, can be used for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Equality of sharing of matrimonial property, farming properties and financial agreements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current property regime is entirely discretionary subject only to the principle of achieving justice and equity between the parties. This approach leads to litigation rather than settlement. The Committee recommended that a presumption of equal sharing be the starting point in the allocation of matrimonial property. It also recommended a limiting discretion to depart from that presumption in exceptional circumstances. Further, it recommended that farming properties be separately dealt with and that financial agreements be recognised and enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that the recommendations provide a balanced approach to a problem that has bedevilled the Family Court since its inception and endorses the Committee's approach with some variation. The Government accepts the Committee's central recommendation that a presumption of equal sharing be the starting point in the allocation of matrimonial property. Such a presumption will reflect the equality of contribution made by the parties to the relationship and the acquisition and preservation of matrimonial property. However, departure from the presumption should be permitted in a wider range of circumstances than envisaged by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the recommendations for farming property, there does not appear to be any basis for differentiating between farming properties and other businesses. The Government does not believe that farming properties should be distinguished from other matrimonial property. In all cases involving a farming or other business enterprise the Family Court should consider the desirability of preserving that business as an income producing unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to financial agreements, the Government accepts the Committee's approach and will move to recognise financial agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's approach to superannuation builds on the Government's retirement incomes policy by dividing the member spouse's benefit equitably between the parties&mdash;a matter that the Committee did say should be optional, but which the Government believes should be mandatory. The Government will continue to consult the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Family Court and relevant government agencies including the Office of the Status of Women in developing this reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">De Facto Property Settlements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth seek a referral of power from the States to deal with the property of parties of de facto relationships. The States, other than Western Australia, have already referred powers in relation to the children of such relationships. The Committee's recommendations are being considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Justice</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's forthcoming report on the funding and administration of the Family Court will address major issues for access to justice. However, the Committee has already made some important recommendations on costs. Almost half of the submissions to the Committee referred to the high cost of litigation. The recommendations propose an increased emphasis on ADR. Litigation remains an option of last resort. However, the Government believes there needs to be better means to inform prospective litigants about the total cost of litigation. Individuals will then be able to make an informed choice between ADR and litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important issue and needs to be considered in the context of costs for all federal courts and the Attorney-General has therefore asked the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, chaired by Professor Ronald Sackville Q.C., to examine these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that particular difficulties may arise in dealing with circumstances where there has been family violence. In developing legislation and taking other action to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee as adopted by the Government, such concerns will be appropriately addressed.</PARA>

The primary responsibility of the Court Services is the provision of counselling related to potential or pending proceedings, and it is valid for the Court service to be active in pre-application proceedings. However, there is a strong argument for referring many cases back to agencies within local communities and for the role of the community-based agencies to be actively promoted by the Court's service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This response from the Attorney-General is long awaited and, more importantly, very welcome. The response from the government is a vindication of the very hard work that members of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975 put into the development of the report which was presented to the parliament in November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some concerns&mdash;some of which were expressed in this place&mdash;about the delay in the response. Concerns about the delay were expressed to me by my constituents in Western Australia, and also from many friends around Australia that we met during the course of this inquiry. I think the content of the government's response justifies the delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be fair to say that, in general, the government has accepted the major recommendations of the joint select committee on this very important and crucial issue to so many Australians. It is worth noting that one-third of all marriages and relationships in this country break up at some time or other. That is an indication of the numbers of people who are affected by the federal Family Law Act and by the Western Australia Family Law Act, which runs hand-in-glove with the federal act. The two acts can be taken together on some important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making the generalised statement that the government has accepted the report of the joint select committee, I point out that obviously there are areas included in the response where the government has not completely affirmed everything that the committee has recommended. That in itself is a test of the measures that the government has used to examine the recommendations that the committee put to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the delay in the response has been caused by the intrusion of the federal election, and the subsequent delay in the appointment of a person to the position of Attorney-General. But, more importantly, one of the reasons for the delay was the consultative processes that the government undertook in testing the committee's recommendations to see whether they would be workable and worthwhile. Those tests were undertaken by a broad range of interested and informed bodies and gave the lead to the government on what it should do with this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government's response was tabled in the other place in December we have had a chance to read it and digest its contents. It has also been subjected to some very deep analysis in the Australian media. I am pleased to record that, generally speaking, that analysis has come out in favour of the government's response to the committee's report. In his press statement that accompanied the document, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said on 16 December that the government had initiated the most far-reaching reform processes in family law since the current act's introduction in 1975. I accept that statement. I think what the government is putting forward is ground-breaking. I wish the Attorney-General&mdash;together with his parliamentary secretary, the members of cabinet and other persons who will be involved in the process&mdash;well in delivering on the promises and the commitments that have been made in this very important document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of my short contribution I have a minor criticism to make on aspects of the committee's report and the government's response. However, I briefly want to highlight some of the major features in the government's response. In regard to mediation and other forms of alternate dispute resolution the government has accepted that the system that is in place today is complex, costly and focuses too narrowly on traditional litigation. Obviously, the committee made a number of recommendations in this area, and I am very pleased to see that the government has accepted the main thrust of the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that the system is complex, costly and focuses too narrowly on traditional litigation, we are not saying that it must be like that for every person whose relationship breaks up. There are ways and means in the system as it currently stands whereby people can avoid getting into complexities and the cost of litigation. But unfortunately the system sometimes drags people along. Hopefully, the new systems that will be put in place because of the government's response to the committee's report will inform people early in the piece that there are alternatives to what is happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was critical of some aspects of the guardianship, custody and access arrangements. It is pleasing to see that the government has accepted the committee's recommendations, particularly on the enforcement of access orders. There is some criticism from a certain section of the community that the law as it currently operates in this country is perhaps biased in favour of one gender as opposed to the other. They are difficult accusations to defend, particularly when we examine the reality of what happens in the courts. We only have to look at the number of mothers of children who block access and who have been penalised because they have forcibly blocked access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equity of the sharing of matrimonial property, farming properties and financial agreements is another area where I welcome the government's response, although I accept that the government has not acceded to all of the committee's recommendations. We did make a specific recommendation on farming properties which the government was not inclined to accept at this stage. I think my colleague Senator Brownhill will have more to say on that. But, overall, our major thrust in getting equality of sharing in the event of a breakdown of a relationship would bring some certainty to the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken the committee's recommendation on superannuation even further. I am pleased that that has happened because this is a very complex area and was one of the inadequate areas of the report. The question of property settlement is already in hand through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Access to justice is linked with the mediation and other forms of alternate dispute resolution. Access to justice is very important and I hope it will be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My criticism deals with the committee itself as it currently operates. We had a further ongoing reference to look at the funding and administration of the family court. A number of the responses by the government to the recommendations contained in the report concern budgetary measures, and the government says that there cannot be a commitment because of budgetary controls. Some of the responses will be subject to what the committee might come up with in its ongoing investigations. Because of the work that the current committee is doing on the child support scheme, this other reference has been put to one side. I intended to raise the matter had the committee been meeting today. I will be pursuing it at some time in the future. Overall, I thank the Attorney-General and his parliamentary secretary for the work that has been put into the government's response to the report of the committee of which I was very proud to be a member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, over the recess period, on 8 January, just 36 hours after it had first been diagnosed, a massive brain tumour led to the death of my staff member, Rob Jones, at the very young age of 42 years. Rob's death came as a terrible shock to everyone who knew him and loved him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think just about everyone in this place did know him as a result of the time he spent here as Parliamentary Liaison Officer from 1990 to 1992, and then again from March last year until January as the member of my staff primarily responsible for parliamentary and Senate liaison matters. I also think it is very fair to say that everyone who knew Rob had the most enormous personal affection for him because he was, from any point of view, a thoroughly lovable human being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That affection and that respect were very much put beyond doubt by the attendance at his funeral on 11 January of people from right across all the parties in this chamber, notwithstanding, in many instances, very significant personal inconvenience in getting there. Amongst those from my side was John Faulkner, the Manager of Government Business; from the Opposition, Robert Hill and Margaret Reid; from the Democrats, Cheryl Kernot and Vicki Bourne; and Brian Harradine, Independent. That, I know, was greatly appreciated by his family, representing as it did an enormous measure of respect for the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob served his country wonderfully well: as a diplomat in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a number of years; as a senior official in the international government division of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; and in the parliamentary role that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to his career of public service, Rob was a marvellous and caring husband to Sally, his wife of 14 years, and a terrific father to his three young children&mdash;Matthew, aged nine; Christopher, aged six; and Simon, aged just five. He is also survived by his mother, Esther, two brothers and a sister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob and his family had already been through one horribly stressful period three years ago when he fought, and to all apparent intents fought off, a diagnosis of cancer, to the delight and relief of everyone who knew him. That reprieve, unhappily, was not to be permanent. I simply cannot say how much distress that has caused all of us who knew and worked with him. I simply cannot say how much sadness we feel for Sally and the kids, and for the rest of the family, in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily, I was overseas at the time of Rob's death and could not be back in time to be present for his funeral, but I did try to convey something of what I felt about Rob in a letter that I wrote to Sally, his wife, immediately after his death, which was read out at the funeral. Perhaps I can read that now into the lasting record of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as my own tribute to him. I said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob's death has come as a devastating shock to all of us who worked with him. He was unquestionably one of the nicest and most decent characters I have ever been privileged to know, regarded with enormous affection and respect by the legion of people inside and outside Parliament House with whom he had to deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob was unfailingly courteous and good humoured in coping with even the most intractable and intransigent of Senate backsliders, not to mention the most demanding of Ministers&mdash;and he was unfailingly well informed, thoughtful and creative on policy issues. Dealing as Senate leader with difficult situations, I often used Rob as my secret personal weapon: his extraordinary personal popularity around the House and his capacity to defuse all sorts of complicated problems made him someone on whom I came to rely enormously. I just cannot yet believe that come February 1st, that great lanky streak of amiability will not be there to tell me in his own infuriatingly imperturbable way about the latest twist in some plot with Cheryl and Vicki, or the latest preoccupation of Brian H, or the latest press conference of the Greens . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both while working for me and in his earlier period as parliamentary liaison officer, he made heroic efforts to get the Senate to deal more effectively with its program and to an extraordinary extent, given the Herculean improbability of the aspiration, he succeeded. Although ill at the time of most of the debate itself, Rob made a particularly important contribution to the task of managing the Mabo legislation through the Senate, and I hope that will constitute at least one lasting memorial to his contribution to the public life of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob Jones was one of those people whose absence just leaves a gaping, aching hole.

I still cannot believe that I cannot ring him up in a minute and have a chat or that he will not be popping around for a drink any more. He was only 42, with a very loving wife and three young boys. It cannot have been easy working for Gareth, but he loved that work and was very good at it, as has been said this evening. He was six foot five inches of always very calm, witty, charming and very funny humanity. I was very deeply shocked and distressed to hear about Rob's death.</PARA></TALK.START>

Rob's intelligence and high intellectual standards, his thorough knowledge of the workings of parliament&mdash;and indeed of the bureaucracy as a whole&mdash;and his calm, sensible and thoroughly charming manner were enormous assets to Australia. On behalf of all the Australian Democrat senators and staff, I send our most sincere condolences to his wife, Sally, and to his three boys, Matthew, Christopher and Simon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, share the sorrow of this occasion and remember Rob Jones and the contribution he made to this chamber and to this place. I would like to share my first impression of him, which is such an endearing one. I do so not out of any light-heartedness but simply because it demonstrates the kind of presence he had. On our very first day in the Senate, with all our raw inexperience, we were determined to meet all the different community groups. We had a whole string of appointments. My receptionist came in and said, `The PLO is outside. Do you want to see them?' I said, `Yes. We see everybody, don't we?'. We were all set to see a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation when in walked an enormous man with his head shaved&mdash;because he had been away for a year having cancer treatment. He seemed so gentle and lovely that I felt totally at ease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took quite a while before it registered that he was introducing himself as the Parliamentary Liaison Officer. We did not share that joke with Rob until a year later when George Thompson came to see us and we had met representatives of the PLO on many occasions. It will always stay in our minds as the first time we met him. I want to express how grateful we in my office are for the wonderful way in which Rob went out of his way to keep us informed in those early days when we knew nothing. I can only support the remarks that have already been made about his integrity and honesty, and his extreme helpfulness and fairness to all people, no matter what party they belonged to or what issue they happened to be squabbling about or debating at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very pleased for him when he was able to join Gareth's staff as the principal adviser. We felt it was a recognition of his gifts and his intellectual ability. So we were thrilled for him, though sad to see him leave the position where he had been so helpful. He was always available, even when he was in that later position, when there were queries and matters where he could be of any assistance. He was always extremely helpful to all my staff. Senator Margetts knew him less well than I did because he had moved to that position before she knew him, but both of us want to mention how much we admired and respected him in his role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass on the condolences of former Senator Jo Vallentine. She knew him longer than we did and she was fond of him and respected him, both in his parliamentary role and as a person. Many honourable senators knew him better than I did and knew him as a personal friend, but I want to express with all honourable senators tonight my most sincere condolences to his wife and children and share in the terrible sadness of this tragic loss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to repeat everything that everyone else has said. Rob Jones was the PLO from 1990. He took ill in 1991 and John Croswell took his place at that stage. He returned to duty in 1992 and later after the election joined Senator Gareth Evans's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob was a great person. As the whip, I was lucky to get to know Rob not only from a work point of view but also from a very personal point of view. Rob was always available to give advice to or assist my office staff. I believe he gave the same advice and help to other whips in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the time that followed his appointment in 1990, I met with Rob every sitting day. I met with him before the daily whips' meeting. Following my meeting he would attend the whips' meeting where his advice was sought and always given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to his great professionalism was the warmth of his friendship. Rob's personality showed through whenever one met him, whether it was at a meeting, in the passageway or in the chamber. Even after he became ill in 1991 and after treatment when he came to the house, he showed the same happy personality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to judge from his attitude, one would be forgiven for thinking that he was 100 per cent fit. I believe this attitude stayed with Rob right through his problems. I believe it took a superhuman effort for him to come back to this place after his first lot of treatment. It took an extra superhuman effort to join Senator Gareth Evans's staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob again proved to be of great value not only to Senator Gareth Evans but also to the new PLO, George Thompson. His experience as PLO gave him a great insight into the working of this place. I believe the insight that he had into the workings of this place was of great value particularly when working with Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must tell the story about question time in this place and Senator Gareth Evans. Senator Evans would arrive back in the country and then come in for question time the same day. Question time would be a great bustle for everyone. We would be trying to get questions and answers and there would be a lot of things happening around the chamber. Rob would be sitting in the advisers' box. I walked over to Rob and said, `Do you think we should send him overseas again?' I must say that he was very loyal. He never answered but he gave me a look that made me believe that he thought we should send him overseas again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the night that the native title bill went through this place. Rob came into the chamber just before the final vote. I said to him, `You don't look well, old mate'. He said, `I'm okay'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to miss Rob in lots of ways but particularly when I look across the chamber to the advisers' box. Rob and I had a sort of secret thing going. I would look across and with my eyes ask him, `How are you?', and he would nod back to me, `I'm fine', and smile and give me a wink. I do not think it is breaking confidences to say that our relationship was special. About three years ago I saw Rob limping down the corridor&mdash;it was just a slight limp. I have been reared with physiotherapists for a number of years at Lincoln Institute and they make one develop a clinical eye. I had said to him, `You're awfully long and tall and you ought not be limping like that. Is there something wrong?'. He said, `I've just got a bit of a sore back'. I said, `Well, you should have something done about it', and left it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Christmas he was still limping and I said to him, `You know, you're still limping. You ought to have something done about that back. You ought to go out to the Institute of Sport and have the physio look at it.' Rob did go out there, the physio looked at it and unfortunately after a week of treatment he was advised to see a specialist. Rob saw a specialist and the message he got was not good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that moment on Rob would ring me each time he had had some form of treatment or a CAT scan to tell me how he was getting on. Whether we were here in the house or whether I was in Melbourne, he would make sure he found out where I was and give me a bulletin. I was excited each time he rang and said, `My CAT scan's clear'. One of the things he kept saying to me each time he had a clear CAT scan was, `It means I'll have that much longer with my family'. He said, `There is no guarantee, of course, when it is clear that that will mean that I am going to live'. We know that our time is limited here but he knew that more keenly because he had had that warning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that is why that relationship for me was special and the fact that he made sure that I knew how he was going. The important thing for him was that his sons would remember him. I guess the boys might read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> when they grow up. I do not think many people read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard&mdash;</EMPHASIS>but I am sure they will. The greatest compliment they could be paid, I believe, is to be told that they have grown up to be men like their father, a man of integrity, a man with a tremendous sense of humour, a man with great courage and a person who had a great love for his family. I would like to convey my condolences to Sally and to the boys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is really an extraordinary adjournment debate this evening. Obviously the life of Rob Jones has touched very deeply a lot of people around this chamber. The extraordinary nature of this debate is a measure of the extraordinary character of this unique human being. After all, he only came on the scene in 1990 and in all he was working in and around Parliament House for about 2 1/2 years&mdash;that is taking into account the period that he was off on sick leave fighting the cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He certainly touched the lives of a lot of people in this chamber and in this parliament. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Evans for the thoughtfulness of his own staff. When I was telephoned about Rob's death I was shocked, as Senator Bourne said she was. It was as though a member of the family had gone. That, on reflection, is quite extraordinary. Here is an officer of the Public Service who has suddenly found his way into the hearts of a lot of people around the place. I guess for a number of us it is not very easy to find that track, but certainly Rob Jones did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on because most of the things that I would have liked to have said have been said. I am sure that the last thing Rob would have wanted would be for us to delay everybody by having a long adjournment debate. I can visualise Rob there in that advisers' box on the night the Mabo legislation passed. He looked pale and I do not think he had a tie on. I was a bit surprised. I said to him the next day that I hoped he would have a good break over the Christmas period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a marvellous character. He had a very special gift and I believe that that special gift was this: when he was speaking to you your problem, notwithstanding all of the others matters that he must have had on his mind&mdash;not least of which might have been his health&mdash;was the only problem that appeared to interest him. That is a marvellous gift. He had that gift and we had every confidence in him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also respected the fact that he had a loyalty to whoever was his employer at any particular time. He had the ability and the integrity to recognise the need for that loyalty and also to deal with your particular problem or the issue that was the subject of the discussion in a very effective manner, bringing to bear his great intellect on the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have mentioned his humour. It was a bright time when he came into the office, frequently, as a PLO. We enjoyed those times. I never heard him complain once&mdash;and that is saying something. We all have a bit of a grouch every now and again, but I never heard Rob Jones complain once. I will certainly remember him and do remember him. He is a person whom his family can be very proud of. Finally, I would like to extend my condolences to his wife, Sally; his sons Matthew&mdash;who although only nine is five foot something&mdash;Christopher and Simon; and to his mother, his brothers and his sister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very sad day today to look at the advisers' box when Rob Jones was not there. It is most appropriate that the front seats are empty today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate when Rob Jones entered this place as parliamentary liaison officer. He was one of the few people, outside my own staff, who could walk into my office without so much as announcing himself. He had established that sort of relationship. As I was Manager of Government Business, Rob would be in my office four, six, 10 or 15 times a day, which is one of the reasons why I got rid of the job as quickly as I could to Senator McMullan!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that time Rob very quickly mastered his brief on how this chamber ran. I remember that on his first round of consultation to stitch up something he left Senator Harradine off the list. Senator Harradine quickly reminded us all in the chamber of that, and I do not think Rob ever did it again&mdash;I do not think he was ever guilty of leaving Senator Harradine off the visit list for some particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In combination with me, Rob had to do some things that not everyone in the chamber liked&mdash;guillotining 62 bills through in four days would normally create hostility in the opposition&mdash;but he did it with such humour and grace that no-one bore any malice for it because they realised he was doing his job and following my orders, I guess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part way through his term as parliamentary liaison officer he came to see me to say how ill he was. Senator Patterson has described that today. He went through a fairly horrendous period of treatment and within a day or two of that he called back into my office just to say hello. He dealt with those circumstances with such courage and fortitude. I would have been full of self pity, full of fear and generally thinking that the world had done me badly. I never once heard him say anything of that sort. He always remained optimistic and positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with great delight that we learnt that Rob would be returning first to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for a while and then to the parliamentary liaison job. When I had left the job of Manager of Government Business, he was of great assistance to Senator McMullan; I know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the last election, we had the normal ministerial ballot. When that was over, he dropped into my office and said, `What do you think I should do? I wouldn't mind staying here. I have made so many friends in Parliament House. I would love to work here'. I gave him some advice. I said, `There are 50 vacant jobs at the moment. In half an hour there will be none'. He said, `What should I do?' I said, `Gareth is throwing a celebration party. He has just been elected leader. There will be plenty of people down there. Why don't you go down and nose around and see what jobs are available?'. Exactly two minutes later he rang me to say that he was working for Gareth. Gareth did not let any grass grow under his feet in employing Rob Jones because he appreciated his abilities. Again, when Gareth was away it was Rob Jones's responsibility to brief me on Gareth's behalf on particular issues. He continued to do that. He really enjoyed his job there; there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson said something that I would have liked to have said. I am glad that we have had this opportunity tonight because, as time goes on, his young kids will start to wonder what qualities their dad had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to associate myself with the remarks about Rob Jones that have been made tonight. It is amazing to hear so many senators speaking in exactly the same way about one individual who, as Senator Harradine said, was here such a short space of time. His wicked sense of humour was something that I cherished very much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time as Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate coincided with Rob's time as Parliamentary Liaison Officer. When Senator Reid and I saw that six foot five lanky creature walk into our offices, we always knew something was up and that something was about to change. There was a way in which Rob was able to put it, as Senator Robert Ray just said, so that absolutely no offence was taken and no grudge was borne against him. He had a real knack in handling that, and I know that Senator Reid and I really appreciated the way in which he handled that job.Along with all his diplomatic skills, which I suppose I have just described, his diplomacy in the way in which he would deal with everyone from all the different parties in the whips meeting, for example, was so magic that it really had to be seen to be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that what disturbed me was that last year Rob was so excited at the fact that he seemed to be progressing well after his illness. Like Senator Patterson, I used to sit over here and say, `Are you okay?'. We would get the nod. Then we would catch up in the corridor and ask, `How are you going, Rob?'. `Really well', he would say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made the same comments to me that he made to Senator Patterson about the fact that he was so pleased that he had extra time with his boys and with Sally so that they could get to know him and he them. It seemed that the medical reports were getting better and better. During Christmas week we had a couple of conversations. I know that Rob was very tired, like the rest of us, but he was hoping to really enjoy a wonderful Christmas and holiday period with the family&mdash;only to have that cut short. I just could not believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to Senator Patterson in the first week in January. It happened to be the day after his diagnosis. I said to Senator Patterson, `Do you know Rob's address?'. She said, `No, I don't, but I'm finding it out on Monday'. That was Friday. I think he had been diagnosed on Thursday. I said, `Well, I'll speak to you again on Monday and I'll get his address and I'll write to him'. By Monday it was all too late; he had died. How can someone just go like that from the time that we had had here, laughing and joking, in these very corridors only two weeks earlier, in Christmas week? I found that absolutely amazing to try to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like so many people both here and outside the parliament, I will miss Rob. I will miss that cheeky face. I will miss his laughter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the memory of Rob Jones for two main reasons. During my period as Deputy Government Whip, and as Government Whip for a short time filling Senator Jones's shoes while he was doing his duty on behalf of Australia overseas, I formed a very close relationship with Rob Jones. For obvious reasons, whips have to form those close relationships, but it was more than a working relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did we share our aches and pains with each other and sometimes offer each other sympathy but also did we share the joy that he experienced when he found that there was going to be another member of his family, when the pregnancy was confirmed, and later the ecstasy and exuberance when his third child was born. That was one of the memories that came immediately to me last Saturday when I heard the news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second reason for going on the record tonight is that, unfortunately, I did not get the news of Rob's death until Saturday of last week. I had been out of Australia and was unable to be present at the funeral or even to offer my condolences and those of my wife, who in turn got close to Rob.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my normal practice, nor that of many other senators who have participated in this debate, to add to what has otherwise been a long adjournment debate and one in which senators are in agreement. There is really almost nothing to add, so I will not speak much in substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find myself in a position very similar to Senator McKiernan. I was overseas at the time of the diagnosis and death of Rob Jones and was unable to take any of the action I would normally take to give recognition and make a proper response to the family of someone who was close to me and with whom I developed a special friendship and for whom I would like to make my respect and appreciation known. I will take this opportunity of joining with all those others who have so effectively and movingly spoken about Rob. I share the views which each of them has expressed and will not take up time unnecessarily by adding to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I was deeply grateful to Senator Ray for giving me this great honour, as senators can all imagine. But it was Rob Jones's experience and calm that enabled me, however inadequately, to survive through those early periods of discharging that obligation as best I could on behalf of the government and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also the Manager of Government Business when Rob left because of ill health the first time. I know many others felt the shock that I did when he advised me why he was going. What overwhelmed me was how much more calm about it he was than I was. I was devastated; he seemed entirely at peace with himself about it. I was impressed then by that immense calm and the sincerity with which he conveyed his confidence&mdash;in the short term, at least, well placed confidence&mdash;that it might well turn out to be okay. I remember the great joy I had when I saw him some time later in the parliament when it was clear that a significant recovery had taken place. He was then back working in the department and subsequently returned to work in the parliament both as PLO and subsequently for Gareth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that Senator Reid and I share in representing Canberra is that we often get to deal with public servants who make a great and unrecognised contribution to their country. Sometimes we get the opportunity to give recognition to those individuals because they are our constituents and we are present at functions that they attend. In the list of those who have served Australia particularly well as public servants&mdash;there are many, and Australia is well served by them&mdash;Rob Jones will be considered, by all those who worked with him in the various capacities that he discharged but most particularly here in the parliament, as one of the great servants of the parliament, the public and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing to add other than to endorse the remarks of those who have spoken so effectively, and to particularly endorse the view that his family should be very proud of the contribution that he made. They should appreciate that we all share, in a very small way, the enormous loss that they must feel and that the nation has suffered because the capacity he had to contribute has been so tragically cut short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to add my words to everybody else's contributions here tonight. Unlike most of the people who have already spoken, I did not have the opportunity to work so immediately closely with Rob. Perhaps it is interesting that I, who did not work immediately with him in terms of management of government business and so on, also had the same experience of knowing this very singular, very special and very wonderful man. I think one of Rob's remarkable qualities that come across to me tonight, from hearing others speak in very much the way I feel about him, was his capacity to make each of us feel singular and special. To pass by Rob and to smile or exchange words was a lifting occasion for the day and it made people feel something special about themselves, which was an extraordinary capacity that this man had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine talked of what it says about all the rest of us, let alone most of the people who work around here, that this man's personality so shone. Is it that perhaps we should make a New Year's resolution to try to pick up on some of Rob's qualities? I suspect that is beyond the capacities of all of us and it is also, I suppose, to reiterate the singular qualities of Rob. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add to the record one small example of a singular experience that I had in talking with Rob. Like Senator Patterson, I have been trained to recognise disease or something away from the normal and perhaps I also have a capacity to talk to people about it. In talking with Rob on one occasion very early on I discovered that he was like me, the parent of three sons&mdash;a category that I think is a very good measure of something; certainly it was a common point that we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about what our sons were up to, I mentioned that, at that stage, my sons were educating me in chaos mathematics. Rob said, `Oh, yes'. We proceeded to engage in a conversation about chaos mathematics. He took it further and said that he would send me some papers about philosophy and chaos. He did so; I have that permanent record of Rob Jones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to share that with the Senate. I can think of no better description of the skills one would need to cope with managing government business in this place than to be a master of chaos and a philosopher to wit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that, with the exception of today, at every question time that I have been a minister, Rob Jones sat in the advisers' box not much more than a metre away from me. Unlike me, I suppose, he always behaved himself during question time. I should record that once or twice he even laughed at some of my jokes. I made a few comments to him, but he was never unparliamentary or disorderly enough to respond to any of the comments that I made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw a tremendous amount of Rob during the difficult times when we had the odd crisis or problem. Of course, Rob was a person who liaised between the Senate leader's office and me as manager and those responsible for the parliamentary business program. I am pleased to say that I had many informal times with him. I am sure that both Gareth and I now treasure the many dinner discussions we had with Rob during the past year. That was a great opportunity. I can sincerely say to all senators that I owe Rob a great debt of personal gratitude. He certainly was of great personal assistance to me in the task that I have had to undertake, particularly as manager. He became a very good friend indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rob Jones was a very fine man. He made a very great contribution to this parliament. He was well liked and well respected by senators from all parties in this chamber and also by staff from all around Parliament House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I deal with the matter I wish to raise in this adjournment debate, which is the death of Frank Hardy, I would like to add my condolences to the family of Rob Jones and to say, as so many senators have said here, that he was a thoroughly decent, honourable and nice bloke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, before I get to the matter of Frank Hardy, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your appointment and to say welcome to the firing line which I probably helped you into at one stage today. As you know, Mr President, we seem to get each other's phone calls quite often. I do not think there is much other confusion apart from the colour of our beards, but I would not mind if perhaps our wage packets were confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I should also congratulate Kerry Sibraa on both his appointment and his excellent record as President of the Senate. He has been an outstanding Labor president in the very good tradition of Doug McClelland, and I feel confident that you, Mr President, will maintain that high tradition of Labor presidents. However, I am concerned about Kerry Sibraa. Someone who supports Manly cannot be all good. Kerry's departure leaves Mal Colston as the last of Labor's `75ers', those elected in the traumatic election of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Archer who has resigned from our side was the last of the Liberal senators elected in 1975 following last year's departure of Shirley Walters. However, there are three senators left on our side who were originally elected to the House of Representatives and were defeated but who were then resurrected into the Senate, proving there is a life after political death and it is in the Senate. Those senators are Senator Short, Senator Chapman and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator's Archer's going not only removes one more link with that dramatic election time but also means the departure of a very decent, hardworking, honourable and able senator&mdash;a man who is totally trustworthy and a very good friend. There is no doubt we on our side will miss him very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now deal with the substance of my contribution tonight, and that is about Frank Hardy. Some might find it curious that a member of the Liberal Party should be providing this epilogue to a good old commo. He was an old-fashioned commo and proud of it. He did have his disputes with the Communist Party, but he still maintained his strong views about the inequities of the capitalist system, although he did enjoy some elements of the capitalist system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank and I were, if you like, old mates from the late 1960s when he was on an ABC television program with me for five years called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Would you believe</EMPHASIS>. He was a member of the opposing team, consisting of Frank Hardy, Noelene Brown and Len Evans, while on my side there was the late Cyril Pearl, Jackie Weaver and me. The chairman was Peter Lazar. It was an Australian history program. It gave Frank the opportunity on television to tell a lot of his Billy Borker yarns, which were certainly very Australian and which helped create a real Australian image for this very Australian program. I was very proud to be on the program during the full five years of its life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank was probably Australia's worst and most obsessive punter, apart from his enormous and quite justified status as an author. In particular, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Power without glory</EMPHASIS> was a seminal work. Whether it was right or wrong or whether it was the best prose in Australia is another matter, but it was a book that put Frank Hardy very much on the map. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got to know him as an obsessive punter perhaps uncomfortably well. For example, when recording our program we had screens on which various objects would be flashed as part of the program. In the down times Frank would organise the ABC technicians to put on the screen the end of whatever race happened to be running at Harold Park at the time, which was very distracting when we were trying to do a television program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He always had a good bet. Unfortunately, of his Sydney mates, I seemed to live closest to Harold Park with the result that often on Friday nights a taxi would arrive at my front door, Frank would rush out and say, `Have you got 50 bucks? I've got a certainty on the last and I'm out of money'. Len Evans, who lived at Greenwich, was the next nearest person so when I was not at home the same thing would happen to him. I have to say that Frank always paid us the money back. I am not sure whether he got it from winnings&mdash;I never knew of him actually winning on a race&mdash;but he was a great and entertaining colleague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was, I might say, very determined as well. He was determined&mdash;and I have to be very careful about how I say this&mdash;to be the first Australian to use the magic word on television. He kept trying to do it on our pre-recorded program. We kept telling him, `Don't waste your time, Frank. All they have to do is edit it out'. But he kept trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be aware of the fact that in the late 1960s and early 1970s the airwaves were not quite as free as they seem to be now. He tried and tried and was enraged when, on commercial television, a female&mdash;I think it was Germaine Greer&mdash;actually dropped that magic word in an interview. We consoled Frank by saying that until it was said on ABC television it did not really count. So he kept on trying, only to be beaten by, I think, an Aboriginal chap talking about Northern Territory land rights. His enthusiasm for those causes&mdash;female rights and Aboriginal land rights&mdash;seemed momentarily to diminish because of his lack of success in this area and his being one-upped by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing I recall most about Frank is his laconic method of telling Australian stories. He was, in fact, the champion Australian story teller. I remember the classic one he tried on our program&mdash;I think it is probably appropriate that we should end with such a typical Frank Hardy story&mdash;about a court case in Darwin in which the magistrate was slightly hard of hearing. The defendant, who had spent the night in the cells, was still inebriated. The crown prosecutor was asking various questions of the defendant. The magistrate could not hear anything and at one stage saw the defendant respond to a question from the crown prosecutor which related to what he was doing. The man replied that he was doing stuff all at the time. The magistrate leaned forward and said `What did he say? What did he say?' The crown prosecutor said, `He said, "Stuff all", Your Honour' to which His Honour replied, `That's very strange. I distinctly saw his lips move'. That kind of really Australian humour was what Frank Hardy was all about in those Billy Borker yarns. He created a real niche for himself in that area as well as in his more serious writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He certainly created a massive impact on Australian literature, Australian politics and Australian television, and in his script writing and so on. He was a lively character. I think he was very depressed after his sister died some years ago; they were very close. I would like to convey my condolences to his family and acknowledge the significance of Frank Hardy's life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with many others tonight, I wish to add my congratulations on your election to the position of President of the Senate. I rise tonight to speak briefly on the adjournment to highlight to the Senate the events in January in New South Wales when bushfires ravaged a large part of my home state. The main reason I do this is to pay tribute to the thousands of people who, in the face of adversity, were able to show incredible courage and kindness to help each other in a time of very severe crisis. At the same time, I believe it is very important not to lose sight of the incredible losses that were suffered by hundreds of people as a result of the fires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The January bushfires raged down 800 kilometres of the New South Wales coastline, from the Queensland border to Batemans Bay on the south coast. The fires ravaged the north coast, the mid-north coast, my region of the Hunter, the Blue Mountains, the south coast and many parts of Sydney. The fires were particularly horrific on the central coast and in the northern and southern suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 January the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported that the Chief of the Bush Fire Service, Mr Phil Koperberg, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have an unmitigated disaster on our hands . . . We have fire so ferocious, firefighters themselves are fleeing for their lives. We are losing a lot of property and I only pray that we don't lose too many lives.</PARA>
<PARA>I almost came very close to the bushfires at one point when I was travelling home from Sydney. It was only due to a phone call from my wife that I delayed my trip by several hours. If I had not done that, I would have been trapped on the F3 freeway for several days, along with many hundreds of commuters who became stuck on the freeway when the fires raged to the north and the south of the points where they stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of driving home, I flew home. I flew over the fires. From the air, it was a truly awesome sight. At that point, the fires were moving up the Lane Cove valley. They had ravaged the national parks. As we entered the plane the pilot said to us, `But you ought to see the fires in Kuringai Chase'. At that point, these fires had not even been mentioned on the news services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We flew north to the Hunter on what is normally probably one of the most beautiful flights in the world as it involves flying over Sydney, the Hawkesbury system and the lake system up to the Hunter. But on this evening we could see a wall of fire across Kuringai Chase that stretched from the Hawkesbury bridge across to Church Point. It is only when people look at bushfire from that aspect that they really appreciate its awesome power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not really even appreciate this early in my life. I had been in two towns that were almost wiped out by fire, with me in them. But on the ground as a small boy I had a real, healthy respect for the power of bushfires. I did not realise until I saw it from the air how awesome it is and how difficult it is for people to, first, escape and, secondly, actually fight such a fire. It is a tremendous tribute to the people of the areas near the fires that they handled the situation and, particularly, how the services came in to support them. I want to spend a little time talking about that this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a lesson in it for us as a nation. The lesson is that we must really come to appreciate more fully the true nature of the Australian bush, that bushfire is part of the ecology of this country and that we must learn to manage much better the interface between urban areas and bush areas in our cities. If we do not do that, the horrific costs of this fire will be repeated down the track in what is an almost inevitable bushfire cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four lives were lost as a result of this fire. The insurance bill is likely to top $100 million, and that does not include the people who lost an enormous amount of property but were not insured. The infrastructure of New South Wales took a savage beating, with electrical lines, railway tracks, public buildings and, in particular, schools being destroyed in the path of the fire. Thousands of hectares were burnt out, including 90 per cent of the Royal National Park south of Sydney, which is the second oldest national park in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stories of personal tragedy, including those of the hundreds of people who lost all their possessions, was truly heart-rending. The people of Como, Jannali and Bonnet Bay in particular were devastated by the loss of 87 homes. Some residents had been living there all their lives. A young newly engaged couples had just moved there and lost everything except the clothes on their back as they fled the firestorm. The losses, be they treasured heirlooms or new engagement presents, are irreplaceable. Yet with remarkable courage, these people, along with others affected right throughout New South Wales, looked despair in the face and fought back. They are now confronted with the unenviable task of rebuilding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fires would have been much worse if it had not been for the incredible work carried out by the professional and volunteer bushfire brigades. On 10 January, almost 9,000 volunteer bushfire fighters and military personnel from all over Australia fought the fires. The volunteers would normally work double shifts. During the fires, many had been working for several days without a break and most had spent days away from their homes and families. Some brigades had been out fighting fires for almost three weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national proportion of this disaster was evidenced by the fact that firefighters came to help from right around Australia from every state, as did the Royal Australian Navy and the Army. The other emergency services, such as state rescue services, the ambulance services and the police, were all stretched to the limit, but all performed tremendously well under terrific stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, another aspect of the bushfire emergency which is worthy of mention is the generous acts by the hundreds of people who assisted those who were caught out. A sense of community and camaraderie never fails to flourish in Australia when other people are in crisis. This was evidenced through the work of many people assisting those who were trapped on the F3. As I mentioned before, I was almost one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the major transport routes between Sydney and my area of the Hunter closed for some days, many people were stranded. They were in their cars on the freeway, in evacuation centres on the central coast or they were among the thousands of commuters who were stranded in Sydney after getting to work and being unable to get home again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service organisations came to the rescue, as did various charitable organisations, such as the Salvos, and even the local residents along the F3 freeway. Local businessmen donated food and drink to those who were stranded as well as to the firefighters and local volunteers. They organised themselves into working bees to make food packages, which were then thrown into the boots of cars and taken to the firefighters and the people who had been stranded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resilience, courage and camaraderie of the people of New South Wales cannot be underestimated. This was clearly shown during the bushfires. A tribute must also be paid to the New South Wales coalition government for developing and implementing a strategic plan which helped to minimise the impact of the disaster. Premier John Fahey and the Hon. Terry Griffiths, Minister for Police and Emergency Services, worked tirelessly to ensure that all possible government resources were directed towards fighting the fires in an effective way and then to make the following recovery as swift as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final person I wish to mention is the chief of the firefighting service, Mr Phil Koperberg. Mr Koperberg did an absolutely outstanding job. This man coordinated the largest firefighting operation that Australia has ever seen. He directed 7,000 firefighters but still managed to think of staff on an individual level. He took the responsibility of breaking the news of the death of a firefighter personally to the dead man's wife, describing it as the hardest thing that he had ever done. Phil Koperberg and his team have performed an outstanding service for the people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fires were a terrible experience involving an incredible number of people. Our hearts must go out to those who lost their loved ones and possessions. Similarly, we must thank all those who acted so selflessly in helping others during the crisis. I trust that the Senate joins me in these sentiments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian third party submission to the Mexico/United States GATT tuna panel is included in the panel report. This report is a public GATT document (DS21/R) which will be provided to Senator Coulter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Government did not make a formal written response to the Dunkel text but it did respond verbally at the meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee of the Uruguay Round held in Geneva on 13 January 1992. The Government's response was along the lines of the press release issued Mr John Kerin who was acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the time. A copy of that press release will be provided to Senator Coulter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Documents containing Australia's detailed negotiating positions are not released while negotiations are still in progress. A number of considerations make this inappropriate. When negotiations are under way, Australia's positions, need to be able to take account of changing circumstances. Results of negotiations are always made available publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a general point, it should be noted that the development of Australian positions on all aspects of the Uruguay Round negotiations, including the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) has included an extensive process of consultation within the Commonwealth Government, with the State Governments, with a broad range of private sector groups, non-governmental organisations, union representatives, and the public. On the question of an MTO this has resulted in Australia taking the basic position in the negotiations of supporting the strengthening of the GATT institutions and dispute settlement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government endorsed the Draft Final Act (DFA) as a basis for concluding the Round negotiations. This was based on a judgement that smaller and medium sized economies benefit from effective rules based systems and from the consideration that the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation (now the World Trade Organisation (WTO)) promised a stronger, more comprehensive, more balanced and equitable set of rules and dispute settlement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australia was represented at the 20th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was held in Geneva from 28 June to 7 July 1993 by Mr Digby Gascoine, Director, Food Inspection Division, Australian Quarantine Service and Ms Gae Pincus, Chair, National Food Authority.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Much of the information which the Government holds on the negotiations relating to each of the subjects listed is confidential. Detailed consideration by the Government and its agencies has been given to formulation of Australian positions and, as far as possible, information has been shared with industry and sectoral organisations as part of a broad ranging process of consultation in the development and refinement of Australian positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Separately briefing kits have been prepared setting out Australia's positions on the issues involved and these have been widely distributed to the media and to members of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Because of the benefits which an outcome to the Uruguay Round will provide for Australia and for the global economy it has been and is a central priority for the Government. Heightened public awareness of the issues covered in the Round is accorded high priority. Ministers have always endeavoured, to take every opportunity&mdash;both formal and informal&mdash;to inform the public, industry and sectoral organisations of progress. Ministers and officials have been active in providing information through talks, lectures, press briefings and seminars to any groups or organisations which have expressed interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round has generated an unprecedented amount of comment and debate in the Australian and international press since it began seven years ago. Issues covered in the Round have been comprehensively discussed and reported by the media. Encouraged by the positive interest which has been shown in the Uruguay Round the Government has sought to foster this by its own efforts to keep the public, industry and interest groups informed. It has also consulted widely with interested industry and consumer groups, organisations and individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has disseminated information in Australia and overseas on Australian positions on Uruguay Round issues. Publications such as the DFAT Annual Report, and periodicals produced by the Department (eg Insight and the Trade Negotiations Brief) as well as specialised material such as fact sheets on specific issues or aspects of the negotiations in which there is strong local interest provide extensive and regular sources of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department also recently produced a handy guide entitled "Uruguay Round Briefing" which attempts to demystify much of the jargon and complex terminology of the negotiations. On the conclusion of the negotiations another comprehensive document outlining the results, entitled "Uruguay Round: Outcomes for Australia" has been produced and is publicly available. A copy will be provided to Senator Coulter. Finally, the Department has cooperated with outside organisations such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in preparing public affairs material for distribution.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="122" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia has actively participated in the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission since it was established in 1962. In this time the Commission has developed over two hundred recommended international food standards, about thirty international codes of technological and hygienic practice, and over two thousand maximum residue limits for particular pesticide/commodity combinations, a number of maximum residue limits for veterinary drugs, a large number of methods of analysis, and a code of ethics for international trade in food. Responsibility for the Codex Alimentarius Commission within the Government rests with the Minister for Primary Industry and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian delegations have left a prominent mark on a range of issues which have been important to our food production and trade, particularly where these involve questions of good agricultural and manufacturing practice. Delegations have maintained a strong position on the application of scientific rigour throughout all Codex assessments processes and have achieved priority listing for a number of agricultural chemicals, including through re-evaluation of existing chemicals, and commodities and general issues, such as long life, ready-to-eat refrigerated products and labelling requirements for organic foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) An agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures has been drafted as part of the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations. The draft agreement encourages the contracting parties to GATT to harmonise their food standards, guidelines and recommendations. The agreement would allow any Contracting Party to maintain more stringent standards than the relevant international standards such as those promulgated for food by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission. However, a country which maintains a more stringent standard may be challenged by another contracting party to justify its measure. The justification would show that the measure is based on sound science and risk management, and that it reflects a consistent approach to risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has participated actively in the drafting of the proposed agreement and supports its adoption as part of an overall Uruguay Round outcome. Australia's current practices for establishing and maintaining food and quarantine standards, which provide a high degree of security, are consistent with the terms of the agreement. Codex Alimentarius Commission food standards, which would become a reference point under the proposed agreement, are themselves generally conservative in their approach to management of risk. There is therefore, no need for concern that the proposed GATT agreement on application of sanitary or phytosanitary measures is in any way prejudicial to the maintenance of stringent food safety standards in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. There is no Codex-recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) for daminazide, sold commercially as Alar. Codex MRLs for dieldrin and DDT will not allow high levels of residues of those pesticides. At its September 1992 meeting the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Pesticide Residues (JECFA) noted that production of these substances is being phased out. Monitoring data provided by Australia, the Netherlands, Thailand and the USA were reviewed by the Committee, which noted that these data showed that 97 to 99 per cent of samples of food crops and animals did not contain detectable residues. However, establishment of a Codex MRL at an appropriately low level, to reflect the fact that a small proportion of production may contain trace levels of environmental contamination, was recommended by JECFA to the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. This recommendation will be formally considered in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australia could ban the importation of food containing levels of pesticides above the limits recommended by Codex, but in terms of the draft GATT agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures a similar approach would have to be taken in respect to domestic produce. In such circumstances a challenge by another GATT Contracting Party to the relevant food standard could not be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australian maximum residue limits are established with regard to human health and safety on the basis of sound science. Therefore if they are more stringent than internationally recognised standards they can be justified under GATT rules. See also response to (2) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The draft GATT agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures provides that Contracting Parties have the right to take sanitary and phytosanitary measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. Contracting Parties may introduce or maintain sanitary or phytosanitary measures which result in a higher level of sanitary phytosaniatry protection than would be achieved by measures based on the relevant international standards if there is a scientific justification, or as a consequence of the level of protection a contracting party determines to be appropriate. Where there are no relevant international norms, contracting parties' measures will conform with the terms of the agreement provided that they are based on sound science and risk assessment and reflect a consistent approach to risk management. It is also necessary that measures are non-discriminatory in application and do not restrict trade more than is necessary for the achievement of the appropriate level of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection is the level deemed appropriate by the contracting party in establishing a measure. The draft GATT agreement therefore does recognise national sovereignty in establishment of food safety and quarantine standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) The Australian Furniture Research and Development Institute (AFRDI) recently wrote to the Commonwealth expressing concern over the provision of additional funding for the Centre for Furniture Design (CFD).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is also aware that some members of the Tasmanian Forests and Forest Industry Council have expressed concerns regarding the rate of progress by the CFD in achieving its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. With the assistance it is receiving from various sources, including Helsham monies, the CFD is currently financially viable. In the absence of the additional Helsham monies, the Centre would need to restructure its activities and rationalise its resources within available funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with a number of other projects being funded under the Helsham Package, the long term expectation is that the Centre will become self-supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The CFD has advised that it did not suffer a loss in any of those years. Financial procedures within the University of Tasmania relating to expenditure of Helsham monies and other funding monies prevent overspending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) In June 1992, at the time the then Tasmanian Minister for Forests requested additional Commonwealth financial assistance for the Centre, the CFD provided the Commonwealth with reports covering the Centre's progress and achievements. It also provided material illustrating a number of items of furniture designed at the CFD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CFD also demonstrated its capabilities in furniture design when in 1992 it received a Collaborative Research Grant of $200,000 over three years for a specific purpose project from the Australian Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Continued funding of the Centre for Furniture Design within the Helsham Package was seen as an opportunity to assist the development of an innovative furniture manufacturing industry in Tasmania and encourage the use of the State's distinctive native timbers. This is consistent with the 1988 Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments concerning activities to be funded under the Helsham Package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. To aid this process, an advisory board comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, the Tasmanian Government and industry is to be established to assist the CFD in meeting its objectives, and achieving financial self sufficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CFD is aware of the expectation that it will adopt a commercially oriented approach to enable it to become self-funding once the funds are exhausted in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The CFD will be required to meet the objectives of the project and to submit progress and financial reports annually. As noted in the response to Question 7, an advisory board is being established to assist the CFD in meeting its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Tasmanian Government approached the Commonwealth in June 1992 seeking Commonwealth funding of $150,000 per annum over the following three years for the CFD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This additional Commonwealth financial assistance was sought by the then Tasmanian Minister for Forests to ensure that "this national initiative can be maintained". The Minister strongly urged Commonwealth support for the Centre, an initiative he believed to be consistent with the vision that both Governments have for the future of the forest products industry in this country. The Tasmanian Government did not, however, wish the additional assistance to be provided from the Helsham Package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) AFRDI has advised that it did not suffer a loss in any of those years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) &amp; (12) A representative of AFRDI sought additional funding for the Institute during discussions in June 1992 with officers of several Commonwealth Departments. AFRDI has also recently made direct representations to the Commonwealth Government for additional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AFRDI was advised during the discussions in June 1992 that the only source of funds available for this type of activity would be under the Helsham Package and that the arrangement for allocating Commonwealth assistance for projects under the Helsham Package is for the Tasmanian Government to approach the Commonwealth seeking approval of funding for specific activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No such approach for additional funds has been made by the Tasmanian Government in respect of AFRDI to date. In addition, all funds currently available under the Helsham Package are now fully committed to projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the $1.4 million already provided for AFRDI under the Helsham Package, the Commonwealth is assisting the Institute in other ways, including by public recognition of its role and function as the national body to research, test and appraise furniture products, and the use of AFRDI by Purchasing Australia for all testing for furniture for "common use" contracts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The question of sovereign rights over the area known as Macedonia is a long-running and complex one reflecting the intricacies of various rivalries, conflicts and tensions which have taken place in the Balkans. The "Macedonia" in question that existed before the 1912-1913 Balkan wars was an Ottoman Province with a heterogeneous population, and with Slavs probably comprising the largest single element. The 51 per cent acquired by Greece, ie Aegean Macedonia, was ceded to it in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest: (a) The term "Macedonian people" is subject to very wide interpretation by the countries and communities of the region. The Greek Government regards the Macedonian people as people from the region of Macedonia in Northern Greece. The Greek authorities deny that these people have been denationalised and that the question of assimilation is not relevant as they do not recognise the existence of a "Macedonian minority". The only minority that Greece formally recognises is a "Muslim minority". (b) Freedom of speech and of the press is provided for in the Greek constitution, and is respected in practice, but there are notable exceptions. Greek law prohibits "exposing the friendly relations of the Greek state with foreign states to danger of disturbance," "spreading false information and rumours liable to create concern and fear among citizens and cause disturbance in the country's international relations" and "inciting citizens into rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace". This law has been enforced on a number of occasions with respect to Macedonian issues. Organisations of Greek citizens of Slavic (Macedonian) origin are not allowed to use the word "Macedonian" in their names. Open performances of Slavic dances and the speaking of the Slavic language have also been discouraged. Education in Greece is carried out in the Greek language with the exception of that relating to the "Muslim Minority" which have the right to Turkish language education. (c) The Australian Government monitors the human rights situation in Greece through the Australian Embassy in Athens and has made representations to the Greek Government about individual cases of human rights concern including about Greek citizens of Macedonian origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) and (3) The Australian Government's assessment of the human rights situation in Greece is in general accordance with that put forward by reputable human rights non-government organisations such as Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch. As stated above, the Australian Government has made representations to the Greek authorities on individual cases of human rights concern. Moreover, the Australian Government would anticipate that the Greek Government would take note of representations made by Australia or other members of the international community concerning allegations that Greece was in breach of its international human rights obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As to the 20 cases of ethnic Macedonians being charged through the Greek legal system for having expressed opinions that differ from those of the Greek Government referred to in the Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch reports, the Australian Government has been aware of a number of cases and has made specific representations in relation to Mr Sideropoulos and Mr Bulis. The Australian Embassy in Athens has been following their cases closely. Mr Sideropoulos's case was raised with the previous Greek Foreign Minister. The information gathered on these cases by the Embassy is consistent with the Helsinki Watch and Amnesty International Reports. The latest information we have on their situation is that the two men were convicted on 1 April 1993 and sentenced to five months' imprisonment. However, these sentences were suspended on appeal and they were released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There is no indication of international support for raising the issue of Greece's "Macedonian minority" in international human rights forums. The Australian Government will, however, continue to monitor the situation and, as appropriate, make representations to the Greek Government on issues of concern.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1, 2 &amp; 3) The Commonwealth has been and remains actively involved in combating this pest, the Northern Pacific Seastar (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asterias amurensis</EMPHASIS>), through a range of collaborative research and other activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) is currently funding work by the University of Tasmania ($14,000) to find commercial uses for the Northern Pacific Seastar and the CSIRO ($18,000) has recently carried out a status report on the seastar. CSIRO scientists have also undertaken further work on a seastar data base in collaboration with their Japanese and Russian counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, FRDC has approved funding for a $42,000 project by CSIRO to investigate the dispersal of seastar larvae and for a $50,000 project by CSIRO to investigate the larval ecology of the seastar. CSIRO has applied for an additional $50,000 to fund another project considering the genetic characteristics of the seastar. In addition to the funding from FRDC, CSIRO has allocated considerable in-house resources (scientists, laboratories, research boats and equipment) in the fight against the seastar and is working closely with all authorities involved with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) has funded a project undertaken by the Tasmanian Museum ($64,000) to determine the present status and effect of the seastar on native and commercial invertebrate fauna of south eastern Tasmania. ANCA has budgeted a further $19,000 towards this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A three-year research program into marine pests has also been funded through the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS). This program which is being coordinated by the Ballast Water Scientific Working Group has provided $625,000 for research to date. The Bureau of Resource Sciences is coordinating the scientific aspects of this program, which aims to find a means that is technically acceptable, safe, cost effective and environmentally sound to minimise the risk of introducing exotic organisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program includes the `Bio-Economic Risk Assessment' research project. The aim of this study is to predict the probable impact, both biological and economic, of the introduction and establishment of exotic marine organisms in Australia, including the seastar. Phase 1 of the study will consider toxic dinoflagellates (costing $85,000) while Phase 2 of the study will consider the seaweed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undaria pinnatifida</EMPHASIS> and the seastar <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asterias amurensis</EMPHASIS> (budgeted at $73,000).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recently released a discussion paper on Coastal Ballast Water Guidelines for comment and further refinement. The guidelines are designed to put in place a ballast water management program that will minimise the risk of translocating unwanted non-indigenous species between Australian ports. While the Commonwealth will maintain its international ballast water role, the paper calls for the States to take ownership of domestic ballast water problems. The Commonwealth is taking steps to establish a National Strategy for Ballast Water Management to satisfy the needs of the many agencies, organisations and industries with a stake in the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A National Seastar Task Force has been set up to control the spread of this pest and membership includes several Commonwealth specialist representatives from CSIRO, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories. The immediate focus of the Task Force is to control the impact of the seastar on local shellfish farms and other sensitive areas. The long term objective of the Task Force is to identify areas of research with a view to finding an effective biological control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no simple answers to this problem. However, I can assure the honourable Senator that the Commonwealth is committed to addressing the seastar problem along with other possible problems associated with ballast water and will cooperate closely with Tasmania and other States in finding solutions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Section 70C of the Audit Act 1901 contains the general power to "write off" or to "waive" the recovery of various categories of payments, etc., in certain situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal advice was obtained from the Attorney-General's Department in mid 1992 which indicated that in most circumstances, amounts of unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit which had been advanced to nursing home proprietors could not be legally categorised as debts due to the Commonwealth or as overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nursing Home Financial Arrangements Principles (the Principles), state that the Secretary "shall" take into account any loadings when determining the scale of fees for a nursing home and that the Secretary is required to impose the "negative loading" unless the unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit can be recovered or waived by some other mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examples of where waivers can occur are in cases of fraud or where an overpayment has occurred, such as when amounts are advanced beyond the period of proprietorship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New legislation, the National Health Amendment Act 1992, enables payments of Commonwealth nursing home benefit, made on or after 1 July 1993, and which remain unspent, to now be characterised as "debts" or "overpayments". The National Health Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993 contains measures which are designed to further address this issue by applying retrospectively to payments of Commonwealth nursing home benefit made before 1 July 1993 so that they can also be regarded as "debts" or "overpayments" to be pursued from previous proprietors (rather than by imposing a "negative loading" on the current proprietor). This would also bring these amounts within the scope of the Audit Act provision relating to waiver and write off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Secretary continues to have an administrative discretion as to the length of the period in which an amount of "negative loading" is to be taken into account in the calculation of a scale of fees for a nursing home. This discretion is used in cases of proven financial hardship resulting in a smaller amount being recovered in each financial year until the full amount of unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit is recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Section 70C of the Audit Act 1901 provides that the Minister for Finance has the power to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, if the payments of Commonwealth nursing home benefits are able to be legally characterised as "debts" or "overpayments", this power can be used to "waive" or to "write off" the amount if the other conditions contained in the above provision are satisfied. Payments of Commonwealth nursing home benefit made on or after 1 July 1993 which are "unspent" are now able to be characterised as "debts" or "overpayments", thereby enabling the power in section 70C to be used in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The powers of the Minister for Finance under section 70C of the Audit Act 1901 have been delegated to various officers in the Department, with the Secretary having unlimited power since 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) See the answer to (2) above. These powers are used where there is a substantial risk that a nursing home may close in circumstances which would then result in no Commonwealth benefit being otherwise recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Investigations of records currently indicates that there were two occasions before May 1992 where the Department recovered a lesser amount than might otherwise have been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 precludes the disclosure of information about a person or individual nursing home acquired in the performance of duties or in the exercise of powers or functions under that Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. I am informed, however, that $7150 was paid by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for attendance at an Outward Bound course in November 1993. The AFP currently uses Outward Bound as a part of its Management of Serious Crime (MOSC) course. The MOSC course is designed to enhance the skills and abilities of senior managers of law enforcement agencies to manage complex and protracted multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency inquiries. Emphasis is placed on the use of multi-agency teams in the investigation of major criminal activity and highlights the co-ordination role of the investigations manager. The Outward Bound course plays an important role in enhancing a knowledge of team and group dynamics and the personal development of course participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MOSC course is of four weeks duration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I understand a personal insect repellent with a brand name "Bushman Water Resistant Insect Repellent" is marketed in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. According to authoritative monographs the insect repellent properties of DEET, or N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, were discovered in 1955 although the chemical was first synthesised in 1929. I am unaware of the composition of the formulation used by the US military in 1956. Issue 692 of The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, citing a 1983 source, states that the insect repellents long used by the US armed forces include 75 per cent DEET.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) While various studies have yielded slightly different results, reports indicate that there is variable penetration into the skin of from 9 to 56 per cent of a topically applied dose of DEET, and absorption into the circulation of approximately 17 per cent has been reported in humans. Studies in animals and humans indicate that DEET is extensively metabolised by the liver and excreted in the urine via the kidneys. According to a WHO report on DEET, human studies indicate that most of absorbed DEET is excreted unchanged within one hour with the remainder being metabolised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (5) Like many commonly available products, DEET is capable of causing poisoning if a sufficient quantity is absorbed. Poisoning by DEET has resulted in both dermatological and central nervous system effects including some of those identified by the honourable senator. The spectrum of effects seen varies from case to case and is dependent on such factors as the route and dose absorbed and individual sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Personal insect repellents must comply with the requirements of poisons legislation in the individual States and Territories. I understand that current State and Territory legislation requires products containing 20 per cent or less of DEET to contain a label statement "WARNING&mdash;this product contains diethyltoluamide, which may be dangerous when used in large amounts or for a long period." Products containing more than 20 per cent diethyltoluamide are listed as Schedule 5 poisons which, should contain the following wording: "WARNING&mdash;may be dangerous when used in large amounts or for a long period" and "WARNING&mdash;KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Ministers do not endorse the use of particular products. The National Health and Medical Research Council has stated publicly that DEET is considered to be safe and effective with normal use but has highlighted the dangers of over use. All registered insect repellents on the Australian market, including those containing DEET, may be used safely provided they are used in accordance with approved label directions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Under the revised Department of Social Security (DSS) provisions, ADF members residing in temporary rental accommodation will be treated as though they were residing in Defence housing. Temporary Rental Allowance (TRA) is payable in respect of this accommodation and that subsidy is to be regarded as a fringe benefit for DSS purposes. Basically, TRA is the sum difference between what the member would have paid for Defence housing (ie Group Rental Scheme contribution), if it was available, and what the member is required to pay for privately rented accommodation. As with members in Defence married quarters the Group Rental Scheme contribution paid by the member will be compared with the DSS Notional Rent for assessment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Service Relief Trust Funds are self funding schemes established by members of the ADF. They are therefore not regarded as an employer provided fringe benefit.</PARA>
