<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That might be why. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> Senator Cook said, `We are not trying to create jobs. What we are doing is training people to be able to fill the jobs when they become available.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It depends upon which particular aspect of this one is choosing to emphasise. The truth of the matter remains that the job training aspect of the white paper&mdash;the jobs compact&mdash;is not simply a social justice and an equity provision; it is about creating a larger pool of skilled and capable people which will in turn constitute an economic incentive for businesses to create jobs that they would not otherwise create in the absence of such a large pool of skilled and trained personnel. It does have an economic rationale. I am sure that anything that Senator Cook said was not meant to cut across in any way that particular economic reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that having a larger pool of trained and skilled people is also helpful in dealing with the inflationary implications of bottlenecks that might otherwise develop through labour shortages in particular sectors as the economy recovers. So it has a macro-economic implication. As I said last week, it is also the case that, as bit by bit those in this larger pool of trained and skilled people come into the work force, the incomes that they are generating and the production that they are engaging in will have macro-economic implications and create the possibility of others benefiting from their presence in the work force through in effect new kinds of demand being created. So, in all those ways there is a macro-economic and job creation impact of the training program; and that remains, from an economist's point of view and from a good public policy point of view, one of the major rationales for this particular white paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I think the minister is accepting what Senator Cook said: that the purpose of the white paper was not to create jobs, but that there will be some macro-economic effect flowing from the creation of subsidised jobs that will in turn produce new jobs. I therefore ask the minister: what is the government's calculation of how many jobs, other than subsidised jobs, will be created as a result of the white paper?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we all said last week, and as is clear in the text of the white paper, the basic target is to get to an unemployment rate of five per cent by the turn of the century. That is an ambitious goal, but it is a worthy one and we believe it is an achievable one. The number of jobs needed to achieve a five per cent unemployment rate by the turn of the century depends on a whole range of assumptions about employment growth which, in turn, depends on judgments made about the relative growth of national income and also productivity. The extent to which employment growth translates into lower unemployment rates depends in addition on the size of the labour force and the labour force participation rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every one of those variables that I have just sketched is one that is capable of operating within quite a broad band of actual numerical outcomes. Which particular combination of outcomes exists in relation to each one of those variables will determine the actual number of new jobs that are created as we rise to meet that particular target. It could be anywhere in the range from as few as 1 1/4 million, 1.3 million jobs to of the order of two million jobs. That is an explanation of why some of those assessments are variable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Access for Australian beef to international markets is of vital importance to this country. The future prosperity of Australia's beef producers, and rural communities generally, depends on Australia's capacity to develop export opportunities. Can the minister advise the Senate of any developments in respect of Australia's access to the Canadian beef market in particular?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="398" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Burns for his continuing interest in concerns about the rural industry, which has been reflected by his committee activity which interested senators will be aware of. As some senators who take an intelligent interest in this matter would know&mdash;which some might think would limit the numbers on the other side&mdash;the government has been concerned for some time about access for Australian beef to the Canadian market, and we are still negotiating with Canada for better market access arrangements for Australian beef resulting from the Uruguay Round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great disappointment to us that this matter between Australia and Canada remains outstanding. It is an item of important export interest to us. It was a market worth $197 million in 1993. However, following my discussions on this issue in Marrakech with the Canadian trade minister, Mr MacLaren, I am pleased to be able to advise the Senate that he advised me over the weekend that, in respect of access for the current year, Canada has announced an increase in the 1994 free-of-surtax quota of 13,000 tonnes for boneless beef imports. I know the government welcomes the decision. I would hope all senators do. I feel sure it will also be welcomed by the Australian beef industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision has been presented by the Canadian government as a one-off increase, but it does go some way to addressing the concerns we had raised for some time about the justification for the restrictions imposed in 1993 and 1994. I expect the decision will also be welcomed by Canadian end users and processors alike, given the considerable uncertainty and market instability caused by the current restrictions and their flow-on effects, particularly on the competitiveness of Canadian downstream processors. Like them, we will be looking at how this will affect the market situation for the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very welcome initiative. It does not resolve all our outstanding beef arguments with Canada. There are outstanding issues. The government remains concerned that they have not all been addressed. We will continue in our efforts to negotiate constructively with the Canadian government to resolve those outstanding matters. I repeat: the government welcomes the decision to increase the free-of-surtax boneless beef quota by 13,000 tonnes. I am sure the Australian beef industry will welcome it, as I know my colleague the minister for primary industry does.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BX5">Senator GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it true that Dr Bruce Chapman, one of the principal architects of the recent white paper, had serious doubts about the prospect of achieving a five per cent level of unemployment by the year 2000? Is the minister also aware that Access Economics simply does not accept the 4 1/2 per cent growth rate needed to achieve the unemployment rate? Given that business is now facing a real cost of capital of 7 1/2 per cent as a result of the adverse financial market reaction to the white paper and the government's deficit strategy, why should Australia's one million unemployed have any confidence in this government's ability to find them jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="398" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One reason that they should have confidence is that Dr Chapman, whom you call in aid, thinks it appropriate that there be that degree of confidence, notwithstanding the report on page 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago. Dr Chapman has since written to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and I am happy to share with the honourable senator the substance of that communication. He says that the article in question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . offers the erroneous implication that I do not believe it is possible for the government to achieve a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down, referring to the reporter in question, Dr Chapman says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Riley was merely told on the basis only of the 1980s experience that it will be a challenge to achieve five per cent unemployment this decade. Moreover, with respect to the number of jobs that need to be created to bring unemployment down significantly, there are a large number of unknowns&mdash;immigration, labour productivity growth and real wage outcomes, for example. Depending on the assumptions made, anywhere between 1.3 million and two million jobs might be credible. However, as explained, the big difference in the current situation is that the task will be made easier through the effective institution of the jobs compact strategies in the white paper. The focus on additional assistance and other policy reform aimed at the long term unemployed is entirely consistent with what is required for sustained employment growth for the rest of the 1990s. That is the real policy issue.</PARA>
<PARA>So let us hear no more of that particular furphy about Dr Chapman's views on this particular subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that there are ample grounds for confidence, for all the reasons I have spelt out, that we can certainly achieve that target rate of unemployment of five per cent by the turn of the century and certainly achieve the number of new jobs that are necessary to sustain that. How many new jobs will actually be required to reach that particular target depends, as I said in answer to an earlier question and as Dr Chapman says in summary in what I have quoted, on how the assumptions pan out across a whole range of parameters that interrelate with each other to produce the actual number of figures&mdash;migration rate, size of the work force, participation rate and so on. Nobody can predict the precise path of each one of those parameters, but certainly the outside range is such as to give us all confidence that that target will be reached.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given the crisis in the bond and share markets, is it not now imperative for the government to aim at a budget deficit of less than $10 billion for the next financial year, together with a much faster return to surplus well before the year 2000, as the Prime Minister has signalled, or face the risk of losing the total confidence of the finance markets and potential investors?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I will not comment on what deficit or other might be necessary to achieve a certain result in those markets. I simply make the point that to talk of a crisis in the bond and share markets is a total exaggeration of the present situation. Moreover, to talk, as Senator Gibson does, in a way that suggests the condition of those markets is wholly contingent on whatever we might choose to do with the budget deficit outcome is obviously to misread the extent to which influences in the United States and elsewhere are having a very major impact on the way in which the markets are currently being set. Whatever we do here we must recognise the reality that movements in interest rates, for whatever reason, in particular in the United States and perceptions of the future there, will impact back upon us, whether rationally or not. We of course say that it is irrational, given the strength of the underlying fundamentals of the Australian economy and the way in which those fundamental strengths will be reinforced by the budget tomorrow, as honourable senators will see.</PARA></TALK.START>

But there are some gaps in it. The government has provided $4 million over the next four years through the primary industries and energy portfolio to accelerate improvements to the standard telephone network in rural Australia to overcome these identified gaps.</PARA></TALK.START>

Given the high cost of telecommunications infrastructure, these funds are targeted very carefully to the areas of most need and, in particular, to those parts of the standard telephone service network that are most prone to difficulty. The first communities to benefit from this funding will be the residents of Penong in South Australia and of Emerald, Capella, Princhester, Langdale Hill and Isaac River in Queensland.</PARA>

If, based on the overwhelming evidence, the Senate select committee were to recommend greater public scrutiny, does this mean that we could expect the government to take some sort of prompt action on such recommendations? Secondly, does today's article signal that the Treasurer is himself willing to take such a lead? Thirdly, does the minister acknowledge that that reform alone would be a very positive result to come out of the present Senate inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the question is based on a premise that I certainly do not accept, which is that any approach by the Treasurer such as that reported flows from the Senate committee's activities.

If the Treasurer has been accurately reported, he does give an indication of circumstances in which, when he became Treasurer, he became aware of certain information and formed a judgment about what policy was the appropriate response.

I draw the minister's attention to recent developments in Burma and ask: has the government of Thailand recently increased pressure on the Mon community leadership to hold negotiations with the Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of reports, first of all, that there has been pressure by the Thai government on ethnic minority groups from Burma, or Myanmar, including the Mon community, to negotiate with the State Law and Order Restoration Council. A number of those ethnic groups, including most recently the Kachin, have entered into cease-fire agreements with the SLORC, but of the various ethnic groups which make up the democratic alliance of Burma, it is the case that only the Karen, Mon and Karenni have not entered into cease-fire arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These payments also make it quite clear that all families will be better off if they take up some kind of work opportunities&mdash;part time, casual or even more&mdash;than if they stay on income support only. So there is a design in the system which is an incentive and encouragement to work. There is no force or obligation on parents to work, particularly the spouse at home looking after children. There is now a different understanding and recognition of that choice. There are clear incentives in the system for families to take up work, but the extra payment recognises the value of being at home caring for children and there is no compulsion to get into the work force. Some 120,000 families are expected to receive nearly an extra $60 per week from the parenting allowance. It is a very exciting change, particularly the recognition of the basis from which the payment is made.</PARA>

One would have to worry that it could be concluded that Glenn Milne is either running interference for the opposition or is just basically thick, because he has got it very wrong.

Income splitting, by definition, is regressive. I would have thought that that would be known clearly. There is a very significant difference between the two payments. Secondly, income splitting has a built-in disincentive for the second of two parents to work, whereas these payments are designed to contain an incentive or encouragement to work. Those things are so important. If the opposition is not persuaded, it is important that at least the community understands.

My five-day visit to Vietnam was the first by an Australian immigration minister and closely followed the Prime Minister's historic visit to that country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important outcome of my visit to Vietnam was an agreement with the Vietnamese government to simplify further the processing of migration applications out of Ho Chi Minh City. Until now, people from that city applying for migration to Australia needed both an exit permit and a passport from the Vietnamese government before their application could be assessed by Australian immigration officials. This sort of requirement had a number of impacts: it created expectations from applicants that once they received these documents their application would be approved; it considerably slowed the process for quite a number of people; and it meant that a number of people may have had to meet expenses which, at the end of the day, they would not have had to incur.</PARA>

The effect of this will mean that migration out of Vietnam takes one big step further towards consistency with orderly migration through the rest of the world. It is in line with the processing that we have out of other countries. It means a speeding of the assessment process in the southern part of Vietnam by up to three months for some applicants. As I have said, it now means that quite a number of people will not have to go to expenses that otherwise they would not have had to meet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison this day, relating to an alleged misappropriation of ATSIC funds.</PARA>
<PARA>At the outset, I stress the fact that this is not an ATSIC bashing exercise but an exercise which is bent on scrutinising what the Commonwealth has in place to make sure that money which is expended in relation to areas intended by the legislation is subject to scrutiny by the Australian Federal Police. Similar grants could be looked at in relation to the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, the grant in aid scheme in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the migrant access projects scheme, and the migrant resource centre program. I believe there to be many more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making by that question was that sections 29B and 29C of the Crimes Act provide for a misrepresentation in an application for funding. That is very different from where the Commonwealth gives money to a public authority which, in turn, applies it to individuals or groups thereafter. The question is: what happens if that money is misapplied or misappropriated at that stage? I put it to the Senate that the position is indeed unclear. In Western Australia recently, the Director of Public Prosecutions has given advice to the Australian Federal Police that there are problems in this area, that the Australian Federal Police does not have any jurisdiction and that the only resort is to the criminal code of the relevant state&mdash;in this case, Western Australia, which is a code state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unsatisfactory situation in Western Australia is that the state police are slow and hesitant to act because they are dealing with Commonwealth legislation. In fact, I put it to the Senate that the prosecution of the misappropriation of funds, particularly in the north-west of Western Australia, has been hampered by this deficiency. It may well be that in other areas of Commonwealth funding there has been this problem. That was the reason for my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question was not particularly related to just ATSIC; it was really relevant to a wide ambit of Commonwealth expenditure. Particularly when the budget is about to be announced this week and the taxpayers are going to see where their money is going, the government should give assurances to taxpayers that any misappropriation of funds is covered by legislation and that the Australian Federal Police have full power of investigation. That is really the thrust of my address to the Senate at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that this issue is one which I will investigate further because any flaw such as this should be taken to the limit, investigated and remedied. It is entirely unsatisfactory simply to say that the state police can investigate it. In the individual states the respective state police have their hands full enough administering the criminal law. I believe it is entirely inappropriate that the Australian Federal Police be hampered in any way by any deficiency in Commonwealth legislation. I therefore appeal to the minister to look into it and to take up the matter. </PARA>

<PARA>Last Thursday when I asked Senator Gareth Evans a question about the white paper and the goal it was to achieve by the year 2000, he categorically said that it would generate 1.5 million new jobs by the turn of the century and that, if the government did not do that, it was simply not trying. On the weekend there was a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> that Mr Crean admitted that the government had to create two million new jobs, rather than the 1.4 million previously predicted, to reduce unemployment from above 10 per cent to around five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today when Senator Evans was asked questions about the discrepancy in these two figures, he gave us economics lecture No. 101, saying that we needed to take into account employment growth, productivity, the size of the labour force, labour force participation rates and migration rates. I would have asked Senator Evans, but we would have had the same old answer dished up again, what had changed from last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when the white paper came out the government knew that it had to take into account employment growth, productivity, the size of the labour market, labour force participation and the migration rate. Nothing has changed from last week to this week. Last week he categorically said that five per cent would equal 1.5 million jobs, and this week we see a rubbery figure of between 1.25 million jobs and two million jobs as being what we will achieve&mdash;a 40 per cent shift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the weekend Senator Evans gave a figure of 1.5 million jobs and Mr Crean's figure was two million jobs. That was a 25 per cent increase. If we look at growth alone, we would need a growth rate of between five and six per cent to achieve the two million jobs that Mr Crean was talking about and we would need an even higher level of growth to achieve the difference between 1.25 million and two million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is not going to be achieved in growth&mdash;Senator Evans is saying it is going to be achieved in these other areas of employment growth, productivity, the size of the labour force, et cetera&mdash;why did he not tell us that last week? When he was answering my question he was meandering around about other issues of investment and other things that would affect the level of employment, but he did not even bother to talk about these four other issues, which I presumed and, I suppose, every other Australian presumed, had been factored in when the 1.5 million figure was given to us for the year 2000. But now we have this incredibly rubbery figure: do not worry about the 750,000 people who may or may not have a job by the year 2000&mdash;that is irrelevant. It is just a number in the government's figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Dr Wooldridge for his response to the white paper, which is reported on page 380 of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Thursday, 5 May&mdash;I will not go through it all because I do not have time&mdash;and in which he goes through the absolutely disastrous predictions this government has made. In August 1983 it had the YEAST program&mdash;the youth employment and skills training program. Dr Wooldridge said that the government promised 40,000 places and that 30,000 places were created, but only 35 per cent of those people still had a job three months later. The durability of those jobs was almost zilch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wooldridge went through the predictions one after the other and showed how successful they were. A lot of the programs had success rates of something like 29 per cent and 30 per cent. The government has an abysmal record in predicting what its various programs are going to achieve. So why would anybody believe that it is going to achieve 1.5 million jobs, 1.25 million jobs or two million jobs by the year 2000? Any old figure will do. When Mr Crean makes an error and gives a figures of two million jobs, we shillyshally around in this chamber trying to stretch the figures to 1.25 million. Last week Senator Evans said the government would not even be trying if it could not achieve 1.5 million jobs. He is telling us this week that we might get only 1.25 million. </PARA>

There is something drastically wrong with Treasury and the people advising Senator Evans. The government has no idea what this will achieve in terms of jobs. It is using any old number to try to trick the Australian public again, just as the government tricked people with YEAST, newstart and all the others listed by Dr Wooldridge. I commend my colleagues and those opposite to look at the government's ridiculous record on all the job programs and schemes. What people want is real jobs. In all these previous programs real jobs were not offered to young Australians and older unemployed Australians&mdash;and they are not being offered in this white paper.

<PARA>Senator Crowley got very excited when telling us about what she regarded as the greatest announcement in history&mdash;this historic new payment. There are a few facts about this parenting allowance that need to be put on the record&mdash;and the government has not done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has indicated that it welcomes the parenting allowance but some aspects need to be noted. It will apply to only the poorest five per cent of Australian families with dependent children. It will be available to only about 120,000 families out of the two million families that have dependent children. It will apply in full only to a family earning a very low $231 a week and will disappear completely when the family reaches a level of income of $378 a week&mdash;well below the average income of around $600 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most glaring omission of all in the government's announcement and proclamation is that it will not be available until 1 July 1995, a full 14 months away. I notice Senator Crowley did not point that out when she answered a question today. It suggests to us that the government is much more interested in buying votes for the next federal election than in providing genuine assistance for the people who have been most hurt by this government's economic policies. There is no doubt that very low income families have been badly hurt by this government's policies and that the system of welfare and support in this area needs changing as a result of the hurt that has been suffered by these families after 11 years of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is the government going to take 14 months to bring into effect what it regards as an historic new payment? It just so happens that a federal election is likely in the latter part of 1995, conveniently just after this new payment comes into effect. It is quite proper for people to be very cynical about the government's motives. The other thing that needs to be pointed out about the parenting allowance, as welcome as it is, is that it does nothing for the overwhelming majority of mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. They have not been helped one bit by this announcement and have been left as second-class sisters by this government in its gross discrimination against the great bulk of mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, as a result of the campaign being waged by Mrs Carole Carroll and others, Australians are beginning to understand the level of that discrimination as a consequence of the operation of the Childcare Rebate Act and the home child-care allowance. A mother of two will get double the benefit under the Childcare Rebate Act for putting her children into paid child care compared with a mother of two who sacrifices an income to stay at home and look after her children. The former&mdash;the mother in the work force&mdash;will get $61.20 from the government while the mother sacrificing an income to stay at home will get only $30 a week. The government is running around saying, `It is $60 a fortnight.' It is trying to disguise the fact that it is only half the payment. The child-care rebate is paid completely without any means test. I saw an advertisement for the rebate yesterday which says, `It does not matter how much money you earn.' You can be a millionaire and we will give you this money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mother sacrificing an income to stay at home starts to lose her home child-care allowance as soon as she earns $242 a year. The discrimination and unfair treatment applied to mothers at home are disgraceful. This government has not done anything about it in the white paper.

It was the hardest work that I have ever done, and I am sure most males do not appreciate this point until something like that occurs. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say something about the differential rate of payment that applies to people who get other people to look after their children. When I was in Hobart last week I saw a chain of preschool children roped together walking through a mall. They were being tugged along by a child-care worker who was looking after them. While I was watching, one child fell over. It reminded me of the convict days in Tasmania. Those children would have been far better off being at home and being looked after by a parent. Yet the system that the minister is self-congratulating herself on differentially works against those women who wish to stay at home and look after their own children.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would know, I did not hear everything that my colleagues opposite had to say in this debate. I take it that their comments&mdash;particularly those of Senator Minchin&mdash;were along the lines of what they have been saying outside of this place. There is a remarkable campaign of opposing this government's programs for supporting choices that families want to make. We have made a very historic announcement concerning family payment. But what do we get?&mdash;a miserable, grudging acknowledgment that it might help some people at the bottom end of the income scale. That is, I suppose, a fair assessment of the arguments of those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators cannot freely acknowledge and accept the benefits of what the government has announced. Here is a payment that is going to help families, particularly families with low incomes, to make choices even more easily. In recognising those choices that families and particularly women want to make between being at home with little ones and being in the work force, the system is designed, firstly, to recognise that and, secondly, to provide incentives for those families to get back into the work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are incentives in that we can say to people that if they stay entirely on benefits and payments they will be less well off than if one or both of them go to work. It is clear that Senator Herron does not fully understand what the basic family payment is about. If he did, he would not have such curious complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin has also been putting abroad a misrepresentation in his campaign against the child-care cash rebate. As I have said in this place before, he voted for that legislation. Here is a benefit to families to assist them with the cost of child care&mdash;something that women in particular, but also families, have been campaigning for and will be very appreciative of. This is really going to help people deal with those choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This campaign has been perpetrated by an opposition that does not want to take account of the facts. It prefers some kind of myth that women in the work force do not really want to be there, that women do not want to make those choices and that women do not want to move between one and the other. The family allowance that has just been announced as part of the white paper is something about which those opposite should be congratulating the government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. I am very pleased to have that on the record. I did not hear all of Senator Minchin's words, but I do welcome that. I heard the start of Senator Herron's comments, and he was being a bit carping about the very small number of people who will benefit from this measure. This government recognises those choices that families want to make. It recognises that lots of people are in the work force because of job satisfaction, the social interaction that work brings and the benefit it brings to their families in all sorts of ways, and this government supports them in those choices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also supports many women at home who take up voluntary work for the same kinds of reasons. It supports women in their choices and it supports families in those choices. People have campaigned for a long time for the recognition that the cost of child care should be a legitimate claim against earning an income. That is recognised in the cash rebate, and I cannot understand at all why Senator Minchin would possibly want to oppose that extremely splendid achievement. At the same time, through the home child-care allowance, which is to become the parenting allowance, those spouses who choose to be at home&mdash;particularly the women&mdash;are recognised in a contribution that is paid directly to them and that will be of equal benefit to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking note of this answer allows me the opportunity to remind the Senate of this very significant achievement in the white paper&mdash;a very significant bringing together in an even better way than before, of the interface between economic considerations and social policies, so that as people take up job opportunities in this country they will not be disadvantaged by the way the social security payments are structured. This is a very historic change. It deserves our highest congratulations and praise, and I am very pleased to be able to talk about it in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am drawn to say something in relation to this matter. I am deeply concerned by the fact that an opposition which, for many years, did very little for women in Australia and which, in particular, chose to do nothing for women at home and nothing to assist women who had to make use of child care, should come along in a carping manner and criticise the differential rate between a payment of parenting allowance and a payment of child-care allowance, and criticise the timing and implementation of this allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I want to raise a few issues on which I would like the President to give some answer to the Senate in the next 24 hours. One matter that concerns me is that we see tenders for government work going out to the market and then, all of a sudden, an announcement that the successful tenderer is a government company. We had a recent example with the Maralinga clean-up contract where 38 people indicated their interest in doing that work. There were people from all around the world with expertise in nuclear clean-ups. The Australian Construction Services won the job, but that is another issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Senate to be informed by the President in good time about who was invited to do the work of making this new film about the operations of parliament. It is a worthwhile project and I certainly enjoyed watching the last episode which had Senator Collins and Senator Patterson in it. I would also like the President to address himself to the criteria which were set down in the Hilmer report where, specifically, in the national competition policy report it said, `Government businesses should not enjoy any net competitive advantage by virtue of their ownership when competing with other businesses.' It is quite a specific recommendation which this government has reiterated as being a crucial part of its micro-reform agenda, particularly in its rhetoric to the states in relation to many of their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the President to inform the Senate whether the Joint House Department, when giving this contract to the ABC, did heed the national competition policy. Specifically, I would like to know whether the ABC will make a contribution to sales tax when it is making this film for the parliament. Does the ABC pay fringe benefit taxes? Does it pay building insurance and other insurances? Does it receive cut price rental vehicles from Dasfleet? Does it pay market office rental for its accommodation and facilities? Does it make any allowance for capital costs for its buildings and other equipment? Does it pay state payroll taxes? Does it pay council rates? Does it pay the training guarantee levy? Does it pay all of the costs that the private film industry in Australia has to pay when it is competing for this sort of work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These answers are quite crucial if we are going to make Australia a competitive nation and ensure the future of the private film industry, which is flourishing in Australia. There are so many film producers who could do this work, but most of them will be discouraged if, when they put in bids for this sort of government work, they keep being beaten by government-owned businesses, and if they suspect that the ABC unit that is doing this work has an unfair advantage over private Australian film producers and film makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a flourishing industry in the community which could compete for this work. It is fair for it to know whether it is playing on a level playing field. I would like the President to report back on this matter. There are many budding film makers and producers in the community. It is possible that a contract such as this could give a young Australian a start&mdash;a Francis Ford Coppola could be waiting out there to make this film; Kevin Costner could be in the community waiting to make this film; a young protege of Steven Spielberg could be in the community waiting to make this film. One thinks of the special effects around Parliament House which could well give a person a break or, probably more appropriate to Parliament House, someone with experience in fantasy such as Walt Disney may be appropriate to make the film.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an opportunity for a young person in the private sector to get involved. Quite seriously, it is fair that those people know that when they compete for work for government business&mdash;in this case the parliament's business&mdash;they are doing so on a level playing field and not against an ABC that has an unfair advantage in the race. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 3 March 1994 concerning Schedule D (Application of Agreement to Queensland) of the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns you raised have been considered by the Office of General Counsel which has provided advice to the effect that, assuming Schedule D has been approved by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, the Schedule constitutes a valid amendment of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement and is not inconsistent with the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of this advice and as Schedule D was approved out-of session by the Ministerial Council on 13 December 1993 it would appear that Schedule D constitutes a valid amendment to the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have enclosed a full copy of the advice which I hope your Committee will find useful in its further deliberations on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Bradley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE D TO THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN AGREEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your facsimile message to Mr Frank Kerin of the Office of Commercial Law, dated 9 March 1994, asking that he obtain this Office's advice on the validity of certain provisions of Schedule D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement (`the Agreement') was entered into by the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and forms a Schedule to the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993, s.5 of which expressly adopts the Agreement. Clause 134 of the Agreement provides for the accession of new parties to the Agreement by means of the approval of new Schedules by the Ministerial Council (which is established by Part III of the Agreement). A copy of cl.134 is attached for ease of reference. Sub-clauses 134(5)-(10), which require a Schedule to be laid before the Parliaments of each of the parties and provide for the Schedule to be disallowed by any House of any of those Parliaments, are recognised and given effect as Commonwealth law by s.18 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Schedule D, which provides for Queensland to become a party to the Agreement, has been tabled in the Parliament. It contains provisions in relation to those parts of the Agreement which are not to apply to Queensland. Several of these provisions (cls 2(c), 3(2), 3(4)(b)(ii) and 4) have the effect of allowing the Ministerial Council or the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (established by Part IV) to determine, according to specified criteria (see cl.5), whether a provision of the Agreement applies to Queensland. A copy of Schedule D is attached for ease of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issue and summary of advice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (`the Committee') has expressed concern that Schedule D may invalidly subdelegate powers to the Ministerial Council and the Commission and that the provisions mentioned above confer powers which may not be authorized by the parent Act. The Chairman of the Committee has asked that this Office advise on `the validity of the apparent subdelegations'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. In my view, assuming that Schedule D has been approved by the Ministerial Council, it constitutes a valid amendment of the Agreement and is not inconsistent with the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. By virtue of cl.134(2)(a), the terms and conditions which may be prescribed by the existing parties `may include provision for. . . those Parts or provisions of the Agreement or its Schedules which apply to the new party and those which do not'. It is arguable that this provision only allows terms and conditions to be made which specify provisions of the Agreement that apply or do not apply, and does not provide any power to prescribe that the application of particular provisions is to be in the discretion of some person or body. However, the power granted by cl.134(2)(a) is expressed as a power to make `provision for' particular matters and not merely, for example, to specify them. The fact that cl.134(2) is expressed in this way suggests that it was intended to confer a power to deal with the listed subject-matters in the broadest possible terms, including the power to reserve aspects of those matters for later decision or place them in the hands of other persons. The expression `provision for' has been held to be capable of referring to `anything. . . which makes provision, to any extent, for what is to happen in connection with' a matter: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Re Hall Autotorium</EMPHASIS> (1984) 53 ACTR 3 at 7.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. In any event, cl.134(2) is expressed as not limiting the generality of cl.134(1)(b); cl.134(2) therefore merely makes clear that the matters listed therein are included in the general power to prescribe terms and conditions under cl.134(1). That power is expressed in plenary terms and clearly, in its terms, includes a power to specify a condition that particular matters are to be decided by a specified body. I therefore think that cl.134 allows a Schedule in the terms of Schedule D to be added to the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. In reaching this view I have considered the general principle of interpretation that a person to whom power is delegated cannot delegate it to another (expressed in the maxim <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">delegatus non potest delegare</EMPHASIS>). I think that if that principle (which is no more than a rebuttable presumption) applies at all in a case such as the present one, it must apply very weakly and does not override the clear words of cl.134(1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The principle is generally at its strongest in the case of powers of a legislative or judicial nature. Since the Agreement governs only the respective rights and duties of the parties to it, powers under cl.134 cannot properly be characterised as legislative. Nor, obviously, are the powers judicial. The principle is generally regarded as being fairly weak in the case of `administrative' powers (e.g. Hotop, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Principles of Australian Administrative Law</EMPHASIS> (2nd ed. 1984), p.240). Indeed, it is doubtful whether cl.134 can be placed at all within the framework of governmental powers (normally granted by legislation) to which the principle applies. The Agreement is not legislation (although Parliament has given its approval in the form of an Act) and, rather than governing the rights and duties of citizens as against the State, concerns only the rights and duties of its parties as against each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Nor do I think that there is anything in the Act to prevent Schedule D being added to the Agreement. The Act gives unqualified approval to the Agreement (s.5), including the provisions for amendment, and must be taken to authorise the Executive Government of the Commonwealth to participate as a party to the Agreement according to its terms. Section 18, which is headed `Accession to new parties', merely reflects the requirements of cl.134 in relation to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the matter of discretion, express provision is made in the Meat Inspection (General) Orders in relation to key areas in the traditional regulatory system. These are decisions relating to the allocation of meat inspection services, decisions made on review of directions made by authorised officers (to suspend all or part of the operations at licensed premises) and decisions made in regard to the approval of laboratories (at which official samples are analysed for the purpose of providing prima facie evidence).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the Meat inspection (New South Wales) Orders, it appears that apart from order 152 there is no express provision that would allow other decisions to be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the Human Services and Health Portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 to provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a long standing practice in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (CRS) to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement, or conclusion of litigation between the insurer and the insured person. The amendment will provide legislative backing for notices to be served in time for the debt to the Commonwealth to be considered as part of the negotiations prior to the settlement of the compensation claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current legislation there is no requirement for the party deemed liable to pay compensation to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the person receiving the compensation. This has led to situations where the Commonwealth has had to recover moneys from its rehabilitation client. The amendment will ensure that the insurer pays the debt to the Commonwealth before award moneys are disbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both amendments to section 23 will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with compensation claims.</PARA>

On this basis, it is expected that there will be savings of about $2.5m a year through the identification of changes that would otherwise have gone unreported and so led to overpayments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH RECIPROCAL RECOVERY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of debts arising under the Social Security Act 1991, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These three acts are the main Commonwealth statutes dealing with income maintenance. Each provides that an overpayment may be recovered by making deductions from a person's payments, whether the overpayment was incurred under the same act or one of the other acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to enable their payments to be adjusted to recover debts associated with an overpayment under another act. These associated debts are penalty charges incurred by a person who has incurred an overpayment and who is dilatory in arranging a repayment regime with the relevant Department or voluntarily breaks an agreed repayment arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Student Assistance Act already provides for the recovery of associated debts under the other two acts. An amendment is, however, needed to the Student Assistance Act to take account of a new charge to be introduced into the Social Security Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would add that only a limited amount of a person's income maintenance payments is withheld to recover a debt. Further, the rationalisation of the debt recovery provisions in this bill will not lead to an increase in the level of deductions from a person's payments. The Government is very aware of the need to balance a debtor's need for adequate income maintenance with the responsibility to recover debts to the Commonwealth as expeditiously as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the financial impact, the bill will provide enhanced recovery procedures for debts to the Commonwealth arising from income maintenance overpayments. These debts amount to about $1m in a full financial year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when this bill was first debated the Leader of the Australian Democrats asked for clarification as to the South Australian government's understanding of the tax treatment of the accrued superannuation liabilities at the time that it agreed to the $647 million compensation arrangement, and for assurance about the protection of the existing employees' superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the $647 million tax compensation and financial assistance package was negotiated, the South Australian government clearly understood that it would be required to place the bank in the Commonwealth tax net on 1 July 1994 and that all tax losses would be extinguished. The South Australian government had no expectation of receiving further concessions in respect of superannuation liabilities incurred by the State Bank in the period when it was paying tax to the South Australian government and not to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 52 of this bill is completely consistent with the terms of that agreement. For its part the South Australian government was from the outset aware that the superannuation entitlements of existing employees would need to be managed carefully. On the one hand, it did not want potential buyers for the bank to be faced with the situation of completely open-ended liabilities which would jeopardise the price. On the other hand, there was a need to protect the interests of existing employees, particularly those in the South Australian government superannuation fund. The arrangements which the South Australian government has put in place for those employees' superannuation arrangements have been negotiated and agreed with the Finance Sector Union. I understand that the information I have just conveyed is the information that would have been conveyed to Senator Chapman by the Treasurer's office. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some misunderstandings about the nature of this bill. Unfortunately, they arose largely from some of the responses given by the government to issues raised by the opposition, including the Democrats. But at least the postponement gave us the opportunity to go back to the other authorities, particularly the union, to clarify the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present situation is that, in terms of the approximately 3,000 staff, some 2,400 were in a fully funded scheme; only 600 were in the unfunded state public service fund. We all know the nature of the state public service funding arrangements. My comments on funding still stand. These people have received lump sums on a formula basis designed to ensure that they are treated equitably, and the cost is some $12 million to $15 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to know the extent of the tax losses forgone and the impact of the capping of the tax losses. I can understand the need for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in this topic from the superannuation point of view to make sure that these sorts of arrangements would not be used as a precedent in limiting a beneficiary's entitlement through the intervention of this parliament.

Provided that this will not be a precedent for the future, it will accept the situation, given the unique circumstances of the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That certainly clarifies that matter. I note that the Democrats do not intend to move their proposed amendment. I understand that this provision for tax deductibility for unfunded superannuation liabilities was sought to be retained by the state government in the negotiations, along with allowing the retention of tax deductions for redundancy measures; and that in the final analysis the federal government agreed to allow the deductions to be retained for redundancy but not for superannuation. In fact, this was not a matter that was agreed in the final analysis by the Commonwealth and the government of South Australia, but rather was imposed on the South Australian government by the Commonwealth saying that the tax deductions for the superannuation liabilities would not be retained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Democrats raised this matter in the chamber last week and foreshadowed an amendment, which they do not now intend to move, they did so having had no discussions with the State Bank or with the  State Bank's solicitors and legal advisers, nor indeed with the Treasury of South Australia or the Treasurer in that state; nor indeed did they have discussions with Mr Downer, our shadow Treasurer in federal parliament.

Again, as I say, to some extent not only has the situation been handled unsatisfactorily by the government in the last couple of days but also the initial way of dealing with this issue was obviously handled unsatisfactorily by the Democrats.

The government could obtain the money that it seeks by the sale of that asset in a much cheaper way&mdash;by going to the loan market. Why has the government made such an irresponsible financial decision to deprive the Australian taxpayer of tens of millions of dollars which it could derive from here on in for years to come just for the sake of dollying up its budget papers? That is all it does; that is the only purpose that I can see.

I do not have the brief in front of me about the question Senator Spindler asked because it is not a matter that this bill is dealing with.

The minister knows that the coalition is in favour of privatising government businesses, including this one. But we would like to draw the attention of the committee to this matter, which is causing great dispute within the government's ranks. When the government actually wants to do something sensible for a change, members of the left wing jump up and down, creating lots of noise and claiming they have been sold out within the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because, as I just explained, the AIDC proposal in the bill, as submitted some weeks ago, was to carry out a previously announced government decision to reduce the public ownership of AIDC from around 80 per cent to 51 per cent. As announced a couple of weeks ago, the government view is that the AIDC should be sold completely. Therefore, it would have been inappropriate, or a non sequitur, to amend the bill now and then in the near future introduce another bill to complete the whole sale. So the government thought it best not to proceed with that amendment and to have the debate about the level of ownership of the AIDC in its total form when the government proceeds with that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the detailed explanation that the minister has provided. I wish to say on behalf of the Democrats that we will not oppose this amendment. But we do so from an entirely different point of view, of course. We express the hope, following on from earlier comments during the second reading debate, that the amendment for the sale of the remainder of the government's, and therefore the Australian taxpayers', shareholding in AIDC is not placed before the chamber again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that commonsense prevails at the Australian Labor Party national conference. We also hope that the conference takes account of the two factors, one of which the minister did not want to discuss today but which I put on record during the second reading debate. That factor is the very negligent husbanding of the taxpayers' financial resources by selling cheaply an asset which would produce in the space of five years the total amount of the money that the government hopes to get from this sale. These can be only estimates because it might even be worse if the equity market deteriorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the government could, but for its wish to dress up its budget papers, obtain the money it requires much more cheaply from the loan market. It is therefore irresponsible financial management to sell an asset at the projected market price that it could obtain in current market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason is also one I mentioned briefly in the second reading debate. It is quite irresponsible for the government to give up an instrument that it could use to pursue its expressed concern to develop Australian industries to a higher level of competitiveness and provide them with the necessary investment funds to achieve that. To give that avenue away destroys to some extent the optimism and the glimmer of hope that some of us felt here and there in the white paper, that the government is prepared at long last to accept its responsibility to provide the conditions for new growth in Australian industries. New growth means additional funds for education and research, and additional investment funds to turn inventions into products that can be sold in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not appear to be able to bring that about by following through the good intentions it professed in the white paper. It is now prepared to limit once again the ambit of the possible actions it has by selling an instrument of this nature. For these two main reasons, the Australian Democrats welcome this amendment. We trust that good sense will prevail at the ALP national conference and that this amendment in a wider form will not return to this chamber. </PARA>

The AIDC board is independent, it is at arm's length from government. It has to make commercial decisions about where it invests its money. It is not directly available to the government to invest in areas that Senator Spindler or I may think appropriate because then we would be accused of interfering in commercial decisions of the board and trying to pick winners, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the minister really saying that the government has currently no influence on the lending policies of AIDC? Could he tell the Senate whether the government has a representative on the board or the governing body of AIDC? Who is that representative? He might like to elaborate on the charter or articles of AIDC. It seems to me that the AIDC was established for the purpose of providing&mdash;as the name implies&mdash;industry development funds for Australian industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler has asked some questions which again I think I have probably answered. I have just received some more information which may be of use to Senator Spindler. I want to put this on the record:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When AIDC was originally established in 1970 as a specialist development financier for Australian industry, there was a dearth of financiers providing these services. That is no longer the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the deregulation of the financial markets by this Government, a world class, diversified finance and banking sector has developed in Australia, which is capable of meeting the needs of Australian industrial and resource development&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIDC has come a long way since its beginning in 1970, from a development bank targeted at industrial and resource development to a multi-disciplined investment house, specialising in project and structured finance, corporate finance and investment and advisory services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, in the area of development finance, particularly finance for resource and infrastructure projects, AIDC Ltd actively competes with other private sector financiers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chairman said in the 1993 Annual Report "The reality is that AIDC was never intended to be in the high risk end of the venture capital market, nor was it established to fund the development of small companies in particular".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC Ltd is a listed company which revolves around delivering profits to its shareholders, both private and Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be irresponsible to force AIDC Ltd to move into areas its Board considered unprofitable and so jeopardise the investments of the private shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a significant private shareholding already, it is unreasonable to expect AIDC Ltd not to base its decisions on sound commercial principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims that a majority Government share holding should be retained so that infrastructure or venture capital funding can be provided for projects ignore commercial reality.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's position is that the sale will be effected only at a time when the full value of the underlying assets can be obtained, and that there would be minimal disruption to the operations of the company.</PARA>

<PARA>I trust that information is of more use to Senator Spindler. He asked a question about the composition of the board. Yes, it is a fact that the head of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology is a member of the board. His predecessor has been a member of the AIDC. That has been a standard practice. I have to point out that, as a member of that board, that person has to accept the fiduciary responsibility and the due diligence that goes with being a director of such an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of me ringing him up and telling him, `Invest in this. Don't invest in that,' or anything like that at all. That would be a contradiction of his fiducial responsibility and due diligence role, which obviously would draw the attention, I would have thought, of the ASC. Yes, he is on the board. We never denied that. But he is one of five or seven members of the board. As I have just said, the AIDC already has a minority, but a significant private shareholding which starts to affect the judgments that have to be made about commercial investment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for the information that he has provided. There is a misfit somewhere in the equation because he mentioned government guarantees. We need to look to the profits of the private shareholders, yet we provide government guarantees. Government guarantees mean that the taxpayers' funds are at risk. Can the minister tell us why the government is issuing guarantees when it is a purely commercial operation and that all we are after are profits? I would have thought that the charter did ask the body to provide investment funds. Whether it is a small business, or a medium-sized business, or for infrastructure or something else does not matter. But surely there must be a pay-off in terms of government policy if the government issues a guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that if the government does not get any return for its guarantee, then it should look to that, then it should achieve that, then it should actually use the mechanism that it has established so that the taxpayer does get some benefit apart from the profits. If the private shareholders derive a benefit from the government guarantee, I wonder what the government and the Australian taxpayer get in return if it is not the intention of the government or the intention of the corporation to provide funds to Australian industry to create jobs in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the point still stands that the government does not use and, in the future, will have less capacity to use an instrument to ensure that there is adequate investment in Australian industries&mdash;and I am not addressing any particular sector here&mdash;to provide Australian jobs. Very clearly, other financial institutions do not hesitate to invest in Taiwan or in Hong Kong&mdash;that might have less attraction now&mdash;and in other Asian countries and create jobs with Australian funds there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our superannuation funds do that. They do not hesitate to take taxpayers' funds, which have been accumulated on the basis of tax concessions, and invest them overseas to create jobs in other countries. What they should be doing, as a matter of priority, is creating jobs in Australia. Is this corporation not repaying the benefits it gets by virtue of a guarantee by accepting certain obligations? Is the government, through its representative, not accepting certain obligations to pursue the interests of Australian taxpayers and Australian workers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the chamber; I do not know whether the chamber will be indebted to me, however. I take the opportunity to thank the minister for providing me on the last occasion that we were discussing this matter with the precedents that were suggested as being appropriate for our consideration in respect of this question. The question that we are currently dealing with is Senator Newman's amendments to government amendment No. 15. Senator Newman's amendments seek to add to the government's amendment the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1A) If the occupier does not consent to entry under subsection (1), an authorised officer must not enter the premises without a search warrant.</PARA>
<PARA>I have looked at the precedents that the minister has given the committee and I have come to the conclusion that the measure that is being proposed by the government under the powers of investigation legislation constitutes function creep. In other words, it provides to functionaries of the HIC greater authority than that contained under the precedents indicated by the minister when we last discussed this matter. I am extremely concerned about that. The minister will recall that I raised the question as to whether any of those provisions of the legislation which she indicated were precedents required the consent of the person or company being investigated prior to entry into the premises without permission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first precedent that I am able to note, which was indicated by the minister, is the New South Wales Medical Practice Act of 1992. I observe that section 118 of that legislation is headed, `Powers of entry only to be exercised with consent or under search warrant.' It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any power conferred by this Part to enter premises must not be exercised except with the consent of the owner or occupier of the premises or under the authority of a search warrant granted as referred to in this Part.</PARA>
<PARA>I really do feel that the minister owes some explanation to the committee as to why that particular piece of legislation was suggested as being a precedent for this. After all, the question of whether consent is needed is the particular matter that we are talking about and it is the matter that I raised on the last occasion that the committee was considering this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the problems. I thank a consultant to the Health Insurance Commission for giving me the benefit of his vast knowledge in this particular area of Medicare fraud, abuse and overservice. I understand what he is saying about this measure and the need for something to be done. After all, the Auditor-General did place a report before this parliament urging greater powers for the Health Insurance Commission to overcome fraud, abuse and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge all of those things, but I am still concerned about this question of function creep. It is a balance that has to be given. I would like the minister now to outline to the committee how she sees that that balance should be made. First, could she indicate why she does not see this particular measure as extending the powers that are contained in what she terms precedent legislation? Secondly, if that cannot be done, is it possible to have a provision in the legislation which would clear up what is obviously a problem at this point of time? That problem is not confined to the unlicensed pathology centres. It is a major problem, as I have been told and as has been proven to me by the person to whom I previously referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has probably been brought about by the 1992 legislation, which halved the number of licensed centres within two years&mdash;by February 1994. The problem has been indicated to me. I sympathise with the HIC but, if we are going along the track of extending functions and authorities, then there must be a limit to that. I know the minister is going to say there is a sunset clause here whereby the legislation ceases to exist by June 1996. However, there may be another way of dealing with this question, if it is an urgent question, as she says, and it cannot be dealt with in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two questions for the minister: can she show the committee why she is suggesting that this is not really an extraordinary matter, that is, it has precedent in other legislation? Secondly, if that cannot be shown, can she please show the committee that this measure needs to be passed by the Senate to overcome, particularly, the area that has been indicated to me which involves Medicare fraud and abuse?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Talking to the precedent matter first, as I understand it, the precedent refers to the structure of the legislation and not exactly to the authority contained under that; that is, the matter of consent to be obtained, as Senator Harradine rightly pointed out, is different. But this piece of legislation, as a model for the structure, was actually raised, I am advised, by the AMA as part of its considerations about ways in which this legislation could be designed. It is right of Senator Harradine to remind me of the point that I will now repeat: quite clearly, there is a recognition by all of us here of a balance of powers to be struck. One of the ways in which we do have a rider on that balance is the sunset clause; there is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, as I understand it, Senator Harradine has also received a detailed briefing, which, from what he has said, was very persuasive, as to why these powers were put into this legislation. In the end, every senator has to deal with the fact that from time to time we are asked to do something different, something new, to deal with a problem that has emerged within the community or within the way our current legislation allows best practice to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to deal with the matter of fraud in this area; that is what this legislation is going to. It is very extensive. It is hard to put a definite figure on the amount, but there is an agreement that there is fraud in the community; and there are, quite clearly, insufficient powers and practices at the moment to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time this matter was debated we talked about the balance between the civil liberties of the people who would be under inspection or investigation and the civil liberties of the community whose tax paying dollars would be lost to them under this amount of fraud. So it is a question of striking the balance. I hope the point about the precedent of the particular act that Senator Harradine cites is cleared with him, because I think I have dealt with that one. I certainly make no apologies for sometimes having to say that we do have to face sometimes, cautiously and with considerable deliberation, the fact that we need to creep ahead with those powers because the situation is not able to be dealt with under the current provisions, for sure, and the situation is not judged to be appropriately or best dealt with by seeking a search warrant&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, but I think Senator Harradine would be aware now that in this particular circumstance it is very important to go and see. As I understand this legislation, we will shortly be moving another amendment that does require the officers, as much as possible, to consider voluntary means of obtaining the information before they actually enter premises&mdash;a requirement on the officers to take serious note of what they are about to do and to conclude that the information they want cannot be obtained in a voluntary way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of brakes and checks built into this legislation. Certainly there is the sunset clause. I have listened very earnestly to the points raised by Senator Newman. The points about civil liberties are very well taken. The committee has deliberated on all of those, and it is important to acknowledge that the way this bill is structured&mdash;in particular, this clause&mdash;does have the support of a large part of the profession, including, as I understand it, the AMA, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the Australian Association of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. When one considers that so many of those are the players or the representatives of the players who would have to face this kind of investigation, I think the balance is worthy of support at this time. </PARA>

The coalition also supports this legislation. The purpose is very important: according to the government's figures, we are talking of something like $69 million of fraud in a full year. Nobody knows whether that is a correct sum&mdash;it might be more or it might be less. But the fact that we support the purpose of the legislation does not mean that we can go along holus bolus with the government's methods of achieving its end when it tramples on the rights of citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact that these items are not being taken or investigated by force is another matter&mdash;forcible seizure and entry are treated appropriately in another section of the bill. Nevertheless, we support the commission being given the powers under certain circumstances&mdash;that officers must first get the consent of the occupiers and, if not the consent, then a search warrant from the courts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it has been a couple of days since we last dealt with this legislation, I would like to reiterate the position of the Australian Democrats. I believe that these amendments go a long way to undoing the precarious balance struck in this legislation. Senator Newman talks of individual rights, but we are looking at powers to actually investigate a practice. We are not talking about patient records.

It is possible for people to go on perpetrating a fraud or false evidence and to alter that evidence in the time required to get a warrant. That is one of the principal concerns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I hear the minister's answer, but I would have thought that that was exactly an argument that the Australian Federal Police could make every time that they were required to get a warrant where there was no consent to enter. It does not address the basic issue of why the HIC should be treated differently from the police. Evidence can be disposed of if an alleged criminal gets wind of the fact that the police are going to apply for a search warrant to search his premises on any issue. I do not understand from the minister's answer why there should be a particular problem for disposal of evidence in the case of fraud against Medicare as compared with any other kind of alleged criminal activity. Evidence can be disposed of by anybody. We still do not give those powers to the police without some sort of supervision and fetter. That is all that we are proposing for the HIC here.</PARA></TALK.START>

Now, we are giving the HIC the powers of investigation which are those currently held by the AFP. I would definitely be very concerned if the HIC were looking to lump the compliance procedures into the same pot as the investigative procedures.

Sometimes it is a matter of looking further than whether there is just a room or a piece of equipment and so on. The powers that I spelt out under this proposed legislation are, first of all, compliance and, secondly, a staged or stepped process that may indeed prevent the need to go further if compliance or non-compliance can be agreed to, sorted out or appreciated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">This is the final comment I wish to make. I have sought some information from the minister. I am conscious of the problems that are faced by the HIC. I am concerned that the integrity of Medicare be maintained or improved as necessary. I am concerned that those who are perpetrating fraud against the system be prevented from doing so.

I am not prepared to have that entrenched into legislation even though there is a sunset clause here. If there is a particular problem for which no answer has really been given, it may well be that there needs to be a limited extension of the power. I have not given the government, the opposition, the Democrats or the Greens any advice about this, but it occurred to me that one way of not having this as a precedent for other legislation is to have the commencement date of Senator Newman's amendment extended for six or 12 months. In effect, that would mean that the government would have to live with its own proposal at the present moment. Government amendment No. 15 would stand as it is, but Senator Newman's amendment would take effect within six or 12 months. That is the reason why I asked the Minister whether the HIC would be in a position to act to overcome the particular problems that it sees at the present moment. I do not think that the Senate ought to be prepared to allow government amendment No. 15 to stand as it is and to be pointed to by other legislatures or by other people as precedent. </PARA>

Could Senator Harradine explain to me why he sees this as not just a variation of these powers on a sunset clause. If that were the case, why not let it run for two years?

They may well be guilty of fraud, but until that is proved in a court we will not be able to say with any certainty whether or not they are guilty.

I want to raise the Greens' position, which is similar to that mentioned previously by Senator Lees. The provision of a trial period to give powers that are not presently police powers&mdash;that is, the right to enter premises without a search warrant&mdash;and expecting that to come into play immediately, without necessarily being able to guarantee the training and the proper carrying out of those powers, is not likely to be a very good trial in any case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to clarify a remark that I made regarding an alternative to giving these powers to the Health Insurance Commission. I mentioned the role of professional associations and peer pressure to ensure compliance of particular practitioners to the inspections. The minister implied that I was indicating some kind of reward, punishment or good or bad feeling on behalf of the rest of the profession. I meant something far more practical than that. If there is a genuine concern that medi-fraud cannot be dealt with effectively without some kind of compliance inspection, I see it is a much more positive and preventive role that professional associations should be willing to ask of their members as part of their professional standing as pathologists or whatever, that they voluntarily agree to compliance inspection to prove their credibility within the profession. Essentially it is the profession also that loses out greatly when one of its members betrays the professional ethic and gets involved in extensive medi-fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In not supporting the government's approach to this matter and in voting for Senator Newman's amendment, I see greater pressure being brought to bear at a more preventive and proactive level by the professional organisations rather than through superior power being granted to the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994. There were three amending bills last year which set the foundations and amended the ATSIC arrangements so that there was an election in December. The Senate gave quite a deal of attention to these amendments and most of them have already been put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one area of the amendments to the legislation that we dealt with last year affects the Torres Strait regional authority which will come into effect on 1 July this year. In the months now leading up to 1 July the government has seen fit, after consultations with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Torres Strait Islanders themselves, and the opposition to bring in some further amendments before 1 July so that the Torres Strait regional authority is in its best definition before it begins to operate. Accordingly, we have in the bill before us some 10 or 11 pages of further amendments that almost entirely relate to a more careful definition of the Torres Strait regional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill extends powers to the authority. It makes it more powerful and more capable to act independently as an authority. For example, it enables the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait regional authority. It enables a minister to confer commission functions&mdash;that is ATSIC&mdash;and other like powers. It gives authority for the regional authority to make agreements with other government bodies at all three levels of government and to make grants and loans to Queensland and its authorities, particularly local government authorities. It also allows the authority to use money in its land and resources fund, not only for acquiring land but to implement the marine strategy that is in the Torres Strait development plan. This bill also allows the minister to make rules for the conduct of elections by a system of wards in all or part of the Torres Strait area and it makes various minor administrative changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has long supported the idea of a distinct regional authority for the Torres Strait Islanders and it has long accepted a particular specific approach to what will best serve the interests of Torres Strait Islanders. We wish to be, as in the past, responsive to the representatives&mdash;indeed all of the people&mdash;of the Torres Strait in the determination of these matters. We are confident that the matters that are before us now enhance the best interests of the peoples of the Torres Strait and, accordingly, we have no objection to the bill. Indeed, we support these amendments to the ATSIC act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also aware that, in addition to the provisions in the bill, there will be some final amendments that the government will introduce at the committee stage. These have been discussed with the Liberal and National parties. Whilst they will be  more precisely explained by the minister in due course in this debate, I foreshadow that, as they have been explained to us up to this point, we accept the need for those further and final amendments to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Torres Strait Islands' distinctiveness, the Aboriginal people of Australia recognise that there are Australian Aboriginal communities and there are the Torres Strait Island communities. There is full recognition of the distinctiveness of the Torres Strait Islanders as a part of Queensland and as a part of all of Australia, but as, nevertheless, a distinctive and separate region of this country. For example, the act refers to the first function of the Torres Strait regional authority as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to recognise and maintain the special and unique Ailan Kastom of Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area.</PARA>
<PARA>I take the words `Ailan Kastom' to be the pidgin&mdash;the language&mdash;used by the people to sum up the distinctive traditions and other customs which are special and unique to this region. The act notes that Ailan Kastom means:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of some or all of the Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area and includes any such customs, traditions, observations and beliefs relating to particular persons, areas, objects or relationships.</PARA>
<PARA>That is symbolised by our support of that inclusion in the act&mdash;the act is already a part of Australian law&mdash;and by our support of these enhancing measures in the bill before us. We support the recognition of the Torres Strait Islanders making a distinct community within Australia. Occasionally, separatists voices are raised with regard to the Torres Strait and the islands as a whole. I note that it is not the majority view of the Torres Strait Islanders to have any kind of separation or distinctiveness other than that which is provided for through the Torres Strait regional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of Torres Strait Islanders are proud to be Australians. That is the view of the Liberal and National parties. I understand that is very much the view of the Labor Party and the government. I have not heard voices from the wider community within Australia saying anything other than that the whole of the Torres Strait Islands is part of Queensland&mdash;and the whole of Queensland is part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all our decision making in this parliament I will continue to urge that we be mindful to provide for the regional authority within the Torres Strait so there is that self-determination at that level, and be so responsive in every other respect to all the people of Australia, including the Torres Strait Islanders, that we maintain the unity and wholehearted support of every individual within Australia for the unity of Australia. The government has foreshadowed that it will move two or three amendments and we will debate them at the committee stage if necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 which the Australian Democrats will be supporting. We agree that the bill plays an important part in the wider process of self-determination, in this case for Torres Strait Islander people. As Senator Teague has explained, it allows the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function and other functions previously exercised by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on the Torres Strait Islander Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former senator Michael Macklin was reminding me a few moments ago that he had suggested this structure be in place from the beginning. He is finding it quite interesting being here today and seeing this happening. These new powers include the right to grant loans and make agreements with the state government and its authorities, to spend money on land maintenance and acquisition, to implement the Torres Strait marine strategy, and to conduct elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the Torres Strait Islander Authority is one outcome of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's review of its operations in 1993. That review identified the need to recognise Torres Strait Islanders as a distinct and separate group of indigenous Australians. From July this year the Torres Strait Islander regional authority will have functions and powers substantially parallel to those of ATSIC in the Torres Strait region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in this bill grant increased autonomy to the authority and strengthen the authority's ability to preserve the cultural identity and integrity of Torres Strait Islanders. This is a unique body of customs, traditions, observances and beliefs of the Torres Strait Islanders which we acknowledge should be recognised and respected. Like the commission, the authority will have the power to negotiate, cooperate and enter into agreements with other Commonwealth bodies, and with state, territory and local government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing that it furthers the social, economic or cultural development of Torres Strait Islanders, or of Aboriginal people in the Torres Strait area, the authority will be able to make grants and loans to the state of Queensland and its authorities. This is particularly important in ensuring that the authority can financially service its regional councils, which we were told was previously unclear under the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the money in the authority's land and natural resources fund can be used for acquiring an interest in land. Quite rightly, it is felt that this focus on land overlooks the unique connection that Torres Strait Islanders have with the sea and marine environment. I am a member of the Council for Reconciliation and in our vision statement we have a reference to the attachment to land and sea. I am particularly indebted to Mr Alan Mosby and Mr Bill Lowah for their articulate championing and explanation of the attachment indigenous people feel for the land, in the case of Aboriginal people, and to the sea for the Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, our legislation has not specifically recognised this distinction. Proposed section 144W will take this into account. Use of money will be extended to include the development and implementation of the marine strategy in the Torres Strait development plan, the development and maintenance of real estate and the acquisition of land. This change facilitates the implementation of `a comprehensive conservation and sustainable development strategy' in the region as called for by the Torres Strait Islanders in 1991 in their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Principles and objectives for the future of the Torres Strait</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgent need for localised coordination and management structure within the Torres Strait region was also endorsed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a marine strategy for the Torres Strait</EMPHASIS> in 1993. This bill today will assist this process. To understand the need of Torres Strait Islanders to organise autonomously also requires an understanding that their relationship with the sea is the fundamental part of their culture, traditional economy and activities. It is crucial that Torres Strait Islanders have authority over these areas of land and sea, as well as authority over themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill and the supplementary amendments also outline the process for authority elections. While the changes to elections are mainly administrative, the additional amendments still allow for extra members to the authority, but set a maximum of 23. Other changes relate to zone and other elections, including the division of wards, determination of boundaries and the number to be elected in each ward. This is all part of the important process of self-determination for Torres Strait Islander people. I take the opportunity to congratulate those who have been elected in the recent Torres Strait Regional Council Commissioner and office holder elections: the new Commissioner, Mr Joseph Elu; the Chairperson, Mr Getano Lui Jr; the Deputy Chairperson, Mr Terry Waia; and the Alternate Deputy, Ms Romina Fujii. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the changes in this bill to the Senate. The changes are those which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission's report appropriately summarises as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recognition of the deep and distinctive connection of the Torres Strait Islander people with their land and seas and their desire in goodwill and co-operation with others, to care for, sustain and develop their traditional estate presents no threat. . . It could be the catalyst for distinct gains.</PARA>
<PARA>Looking down this speakers list, I rather suspect that we are going to hear something on Aboriginal health from Senator Herron. Some speakers may refer to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. I want to make a couple of comments in anticipation. Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on ATSIC was a little one-sided. It was certainly put together by a well-intentioned journalist who shares with many people the frustration of what seems to be the pace of delivery of services at the community level in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not think the program made the point sufficiently well&mdash;a point which I have made here so many times and which needs to be repeated: ATSIC is four years old. Why would we impose on one society of people the assumption and the expectation that they should be monolithic&mdash;that they should have one political view? Why would we not expect and allow a difference of opinion over the best way to deliver an outcome? Why would we expect that, in four years, ATSIC would be able, with the best will in the world and on the budget it has, to make up for 200 years&mdash;certainly 100 years&mdash;of mismanagement and lack of cooperation which sometimes our federal system is characterised by?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this bill will not turn into a focus for an attack on ATSIC. It has an incredibly difficult job, and nobody is saying that it does it perfectly. This bill is a result of an important review, and this next step forward in recognising the autonomy of the Torres Strait Islander people certainly has the support of the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 and all the amendments that are thereto attached. My involvement with the Torres Strait and the Torres Strait Islanders goes back some considerable time to 1983, when I was first elected and went to the Torres Strait on a Senate inquiry. I got to know the people. I was also on the original Senate inquiry that investigated ATSIC. In those days I fought in the parliament to have the Torres Strait Islanders and all their islands and their communities on the mainland incorporated into their own particular region for the very reason that they were a different race of people with different cultural expectations, and they wanted to protect those differences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in this bill are only an advancement or a further step in the amendment that was originally moved, either by myself or by Senator Baume, when we drew a region around all the island communities and the mainland communities of Seisia and Bamaga and allowed them to have their own regional council. Even then, that regional council was administered by ATSIC. Those communities became a minority of a minority. It was always their concern. Now, with the establishment of this bill and last year's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3), they have gone a long way to their own self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the Torres Strait Islands and the islanders who live on them have much more autonomy than the people of Christmas Island or Cocos Island. I know they are very vocal on some occasions in seeking what they call independence, but I believe what they are saying is that they want the Torres Strait Islands to be considered as a territory. I have pointed out to them from time to time that they have more autonomy than the Malays on Cocos Island and on Christmas Island, which are territories. I want the Torres Strait Islanders to consider that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of the authority is based on the recommendations contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's report on the review of the operations of the 1989 ATSIC Act. The other recommendations in the report relating to streamlining zone election rules are also dealt with in this bill. The main provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 allow the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Torres Strait regional authority&mdash;to confer ATSIC functions on the authority. I suppose this will mean that the authority will be a mini-ATSIC, with the same powers and responsibilities as ATSIC. It has taken since 1989 for this to come about. I congratulate those communities on their perseverance in pursuing this matter; but it is a matter that, I believe, receives support from all senators of all parties in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other main provisions of this bill include: the authority to have power to negotiate, cooperate and enter into agreements with other Commonwealth bodies and with state, territory and local government bodies, and to make grants and loans to the state of Queensland and its authorities, including the local government; the expansion of the Torres Strait regional authority land and resources fund; and the minister to consult and make rules for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area by a system of wards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know now that there is also a state-run island coordinating council that has been the main avenue for people from the various islands who are elected at local government elections every three years under the Queensland local government legislation. The chairmen of those island councils form the island coordinating council. So we are now going to have an island coordinating council as well as this new authority that will be responsible for administering federal issues. I see some sort of a conflict there. It may be not so much a conflict as two bodies doing different things. Maybe in the future they can be brought together. I think that is one of the islanders' aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to the islanders. I rang them and asked them whether they had any problems with the bill. They said that it has their support and that they look forward to its implementation. They are particularly keen to get it going right. They say that they have now been given the opportunity to run their own affairs. They are particularly keen to make sure that they make a total success of running this authority. They will know that the eyes of the media and the parliament will be upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They told me today that they want to take it pretty slowly before they do anything other than bring the island coordinating council and the new authority together. They are also well aware of the responsibilities that have been placed on them. They are very keen to make sure that they are accountable in all areas and that they are able to deliver the services that their constituents need. They asked me to raise in parliament their concern about the run-off from Ok Tedi mine running down the Fly River. The Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the Torres Strait areas for the impurities that they believe have run off, but has withdrawn its service. They asked me to express their fear that the run-off may be interfering with their fishing and prawning grounds in the Torres Strait. So I place their concern on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also add my congratulations to those of other speakers. When ATSIC was established there were misgivings on the part of not only the federal government but also many Aboriginal and Islanders which they expressed to the Senate committee when we were taking evidence. A number of them believed that ATSIC would overrule their local communities and they were not particularly keen to go ahead with it. I think there are still some fears. The fact that the Islanders can now run their own ship has relieved them of the majority of their fears. I wish them all the best. I hope that they do a particularly good job of administering this new authority and hold their end up, do the right thing and make a very successful go of it, as I am sure they will. </PARA>

First of all, clause 3 amends section 35 of the principal act by removing subclause 5.15 from its ambit, thereby removing the prohibition on amending that subclause. Once the prohibition has been removed, subclause 5.15 of the agreement, as contained in the schedule, can then be amended. That amendment remains subject to clause 20 of the agreement, which provides that any amendment to the agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Defence service homes mortgage portfolio was sold and the Westpac Banking Corporation, which now operates the Defence service homes scheme under the Department of Veterans' Affairs, became the scheme's lender. The new scheme to cover those no longer eligible under the scheme which was sold was to operate from May 1991 and was to be run by the National Australia Bank, which was awarded a 15-year franchise. </PARA>

When the agreement was drawn up, special introductory rates for new loans, with interest rates fixed for a period of 12 months or less, were not contemplated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 is one that the coalition generally agrees with. It follows on from a customs tariff amendment bill that the Senate dealt with last week. On that occasion I raised matters of very great concern to me and other members of both houses of parliament on the question of airline safety. These tariff bills relate to increases in the excise on Avgas and Avtur, and the money is being raised to go towards the cost of air safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air safety is something that we are all very greatly concerned about. Last week in the debate I raised the question of the administration by the Civil Aviation Authority of issues of air safety. It is worth repeating that there have been so many inquiries into air safety and the Civil Aviation Authority and we never seem to get anywhere. We seem to keep going around in circles, and still there are horrendous examples which come out of lapses in administration of air safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes amendment to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that act two excise tariff proposals. Excise tariff proposal No. 2 proposes a reduction in excise duty payable in respect of Avgas, and excise tariff proposal No. 3 proposes an increase in excise duty payable in respect of Avgas and Avtur. It is proposed to reduce the excise on Avgas from $0.25456 per litre to $0.2243 per litre, a reduction of 3.013 cents per litre effective from 1 July 1993. This reduction results from the final stage of the government's program of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to the full local ownership program. In 1993-94, outlays of $4.1 million in maintenance grants and $2 million in subsidies will secure the transfer of all 11 remaining aerodromes and the civil areas of three defence aerodromes. That program is one that has been under way for some time and is in its final stages. It is one that has seen most of the local aerodromes around the nation taken over by local ownership, and that program is coming to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction also results from changes in the cost recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the CAA and changes in the cost recovery arrangements by CAA in the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. In future, both the firefighting and meteorological services will be directly charged to aircraft operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the amount of excise duty required to fund the aerodromes and these two services is reduced, the rate of duty can also be reduced. A decrease of 1.013c per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program, and the remaining 2c per litre is attributable to the firefighting and meteorological services. It is also proposed to increase the excise payable on Avgas to $0.2299 per litre&mdash;an increase of 0.264c per litre. The increase was announced in the 1993 budget and it is effectively backdated from 1 September 1993. It is to enable the CAA to recover part of its costs of the aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is the first stage in a program to phase in recovery of the industry's contribution to these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National coalition will not oppose these measures. The reduction in the level of duty resulting from the changes to ALOP, firefighting services and meteorological services is unexceptional. The increases in the rate of duty on Avgas and the new duty imposed on Avtur to fund aviation safety are more controversial. These relate to a plan of cost recovery that I will not repeat because I spoke about it in the bill last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is discontent within the aviation industry over the government's original proposal which resulted in that original proposal being withdrawn. Apparently, the general view in the aviation industry is that, given that the government is not prepared to meet the costs of setting safety standards and ensuring compliance and that the industry must meet half the costs of these services, the bill is a reasonable method of covering the industry's share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again raise in the parliament my real concern about matters of safety generally. I repeat: I have been concerned at the answers or non-answers that I have been given by the CAA to questions I have raised both on notice in this chamber and in estimates committees, and will be pursuing again in estimates committees. I again raise the absolute inability of this government, it appears, to answer questions within the 30-day time limit. There are a number of questions which I have on notice, the answers to which are now outside the 30-day limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the government will have to be forced, screaming and kicking, to answer those sorts of questions. Apparently, the government is not prepared to comply with the rules. We will have to move the formal procedures within the Senate to get the answers to those questions. So at this stage I will not delay the Senate any further. These matters of the CAA and air safety will have to be pursued at the appropriate time. I repeat: it is not the intention of the Liberal-National party coalition to oppose these measures currently before the Senate.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, which has three purposes: firstly, to reduce the rate of excise duty payable on aviation gasoline by 3.013c per litre from 1 July 1993; secondly, to increase the rate of excise duty on Avgas by 0.264c per litre from 1 September 1993; and, thirdly, to increase the rate of excise duty on aviation kerosene by 0.264c per litre from 1 September 1993. These amendments to the tariff schedules all represent a validation of changes which have already been implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to these amendments is that the corresponding customs tariff increase has been covered by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994. They relate to cost recovery from the airlines for the Civil Aviation Authority's provision of fire safety and meteorological services to the industry. In its 1992 budget, the government announced that it would move to a fifty-fifty cost sharing formula with the industry, after protests from the industry about a policy of full cost recovery which was announced in the 1990-91 budget but never implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's failure to get industry agreement to a cost sharing mechanism led to the adoption of an interim measure to recover some costs from the industry in the 1993-94 budget. This involved increasing the customs and excise on Avgas and Avtur as per the bill and levying a charge on domestic based aircraft used in international operations since these are exempt from the excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to the first measure mentioned, the much larger decrease relates to savings being passed back to the industry from the aerodrome local ownership plan. This plan dates back to the 1950s when it was decided that it did not make sense for the Commonwealth to retain ownership of all the small airports around Australia. The plan led to the handover of airport ownership to local authorities, usually the local government authorities. To sweeten the deal, the Commonwealth usually undertook any necessary capital works to bring the airport up to the required standard and also undertook some ongoing cost sharing in some cases. The whole plan was speeded up in the mid-1980s with the Commonwealth making large one-off payments to the local authorities representing the notional discounted value of future costs that the Commonwealth would otherwise have borne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this operation the Commonwealth now runs fewer than 100 aerodromes and has made resultant savings in recurrent costs. That is why it is now passing back this saving to industry as a reduction in Avgas excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of this bill, on the basis of the three purposes that I have outlined, is that there will be a net decrease in the tariff on aviation fuel. The Australian Democrats are concerned about the impact of tariff increases in aviation fuel on people in remote areas and that is a battle to be fought in the future. I would like the government to take note that we are concerned about that, and whatever cost sharing arrangements are arrived at by the government in the future in this area to cover the costs of providing safety and meteorological services should take into account that any across-the-board increases in the ultimate cost of aviation fuel will affect people in remote communities much more severely. I do not think that I need to detain the Senate any longer. The Australian Democrats will not oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak in tonight's adjournment debate about the life of someone with whom I have had the privilege of sharing the last 14 or 15 years of my life. I refer to a great Western Australian Liberal, the Hon. Robert Gerald Pike, who passed away very suddenly very late on Anzac Day, 25 April. Along with hundreds of Western Australians, I had the privilege of attending Bob Pike's funeral on the Thursday before last, along with Bob's widow Patti and his seven children and many colleagues from both sides of politics. It was a very sad and solemn occasion, particularly as Bob was so active in political life in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a larger than life character for many reasons. When someone who had such a crucial role in the Western Australian Liberal Party and parliamentary politics in Western Australia is taken from this earth so quickly and unexpectedly in very much the prime of his life, it is a very sad occasion&mdash;particularly for those of us who were very close to Bob, as I was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to take some of the time of the Senate tonight to reflect on some of Bob's contributions, some of the times that I personally spent with Bob, and some of the battles that we fought together. I hope the Senate will indulge me for some time while these remarks are put down in the Senate record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite appropriate, indeed, that Bob Pike have a tribute paid to him in the Senate because, above all the things that Bob was in his life, he was a very strong family man, a very successful businessman, a very successful person in local government and a very successful person in the lay organisation of the Liberal Party. One of the most driving elements in his political philosophy was that he was a strong federalist. He was a great supporter of views of the founding fathers as to how the federation should be formed. He was a great student of the history of federation, not only in Australia but also in the United States and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Liberal Party coalition won the last state election in Western Australia the Premier, Richard Court, appointed Bob Pike to have special responsibility for federal-state relations as a parliamentary secretary to the Premier. That is an area that the Premier is pursuing very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite appropriate that Bob Pike have a tribute paid to him in the Senate because he was a great supporter of the institution of the Senate. Last week, as I was preparing some notes for this speech, I thought what a great senator Bob Pike would have made. One aspect of his life that many people did not know about was that he did not enjoy plane travel at all. I think he was a bit scared of plane travel, and if he had the choice between catching a plane across to the eastern states or getting on a train, he would always get on the train or drive his car. As Senator McMullan would know, one could not really be a senator from Western Australia if one had an aversion to aeroplane travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall it, I met Bob Pike&mdash;I do not keep a diary as accurately as Mr Pike did&mdash;back in about 1981 or 1982, a year or so after I joined the young Liberal movement and the university liberal club. We were then lobbying the Court-O'Connor Liberal government on the voluntary student union legislation. At that time Bob was minister for sports and youth, as I recall, and he was a fairly active and influential member of the O'Connor government, as it was then. I was quite impressed by Mr Pike. Anyone who met him could not have failed to have at least left the room with some impression of him because he was a flamboyant character, an articulate character and a very likeable character. As a very keen, enthusiastic, if not ambitious young Liberal, I had a lot to do with Bob leading up to what was a very disastrous 1983 state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was involved in the Whitford campaign in which we were very thoroughly beaten by Pam Beggs, who went on to become a minister after the election. I ran the Whitford campaign as chairman, and Bob, an upper house member at that time, was involved in the campaign as well. I recall going to a protest meeting at the Whitford Nodes and basically being a spy there on Pam Beggs and Brian Burke, as he then was, for Bob Pike. I attended the meeting and then I went to Bob's office at six o'clock the next morning and gave him a detailed report on what was said. Of course, what we said about the Whitford Nodes made no difference at all in that seat. It was a mortgage belt seat and it saw an enormous swing against us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worked very closely with Bob in that period. I quickly gained the impression that he was someone who was a very solid grassroots worker who had very good links with the organisation and treated the Liberal organisation with enormous respect. He was not one of those politicians who get elected to a seat in parliament, or to the upper house, and quickly forget those who endorsed them and put them into power. That was the theme of so much of Bob Pike's political career. He kept close links not only with the organisation, the branches and the divisions of the Liberal Party, but also with the community in a whole series of different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next interesting part of my life with Bob Pike was when Ian Medcalf MLC decided to retire from the parliament and left a vacancy in what I think was called the north metropolitan region. It was like a Senate casual vacancy; it was a walk-in into the parliament, so we had a Melbourne Cup field. I think 15 or 16 candidates decided they wanted to grace the benches of the upper house. I, as a 24-year-old who thought he knew how to change the world and fix all the problems of the world, decided to put up my hand for it. Bob Pike, having just lost his seat at the 1983 election, also decided that he wanted to walk into Meddy's seat. Of course, Max Evans, who was ultimately successful in the preselection, had nominated. Even Senator Ellison might have toyed with the idea at some stage, but he was probably wiser than me and did not stick up his hand at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob was in the running. Even though I had had a bit to do with Bob, I was not close to him at that time. He was going around lobbying the people that I was lobbying. He was getting commitments from them, and so was I. It was quite a battle. It was friendly between Bob and me. In the end, Max Evans won the first preselection. As Senator Ellison will remember, I became aware at the preselection&mdash;I think there were 87 or 88 people entitled to vote&mdash;that a couple of people there who happened to be university Liberal club members were not actually entitled to be there. That was my understanding of the constitution. Even though I suspected very strongly that the university Liberals at the preselection would have voted for me, I also suspected that if Bob Pike and I worked together, if we had a re-run of the preselection, we might do better. So I had those university Liberals wiped off the preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing was that someone had to put in the appeal within the 48-hour cut-off period after the preselection. I was quite determined that I had been totally wronged by the process and quite determined that I would have this appeal. I thought it would be better politics if both Bob Pike and I put in the appeal, so that neither of us had the odium of being the appellant, overturning this preselection and upsetting 87 people who did not want to come out on a cold, dark night and run through a boring preselection process again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob and I had a Mexican stand-off all night. The cut-off period was about 11 o'clock on a Sunday night. Bob played the greatest game of poker that has ever been seen that night. He obviously knew that I was going to put in the appeal. I kept ringing him and saying, `Bob, I won't do it unless you do it, too.' He said, ` No, I'm quite happy for there to be an appeal but you do it, young man. I'm not going to put it in.' Basically, it was left until about 10 minutes before the cut-off time when I finally jumped in my car and drove to Bob Harris's house. In fact, I was sitting at Chilla Porter's house making last minute calls, trying to get Pikey to be a co-signatory to the appeal. Of course, he had me totally sussed and was not part of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We both presented ourselves for preselection and history records that Max Evans won it again. Max has gone on to be the Minister for Finance in the Court government, and I am still a backbencher in opposition over here. Mind you, there was one bonus in that whole thing: I have saved myself from sitting on the back bench of the upper house in Western Australia for 10 or 11 years. So more power to Max!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it was a good experience. Having been through that process with Bob of going through the preselection, we did get a lot closer. The next thing that came up was the Stirling federal division preselection in 1987. Bob was the president of the Stirling division. Again, he had left parliament. He had not left the party. He had not run off with his tail between his legs and ignored the party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the indulgence of the chamber. The Stirling preselection was another traumatic period in my life because I won the preselection, with a lot of assistance from Bob Pike on the ground organising the numbers. At that time, the President of the Liberal Party was Keith Simpson, who was certainly no friend of mine or Bob Pike's, and he was determined to ensure that I did not get that preselection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We fought an extremely bitter fight during that period leading up to the July 1987 election. The president, Keith Simpson, tried every trick in the book and, in fact, got a legal opinion from a renowned Labor lawyer to say that the branches that were mine were not entitled to vote and, of course, that preselection was overturned. I record, for the first time in public, the incredible support that Bob Pike gave me during that incredibly traumatic time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next period when we worked together was during the 1990 Senate preselection which saw me arrive in this place. Bob, as an exquisite understander of the politics and also the feelings of the organisation, not only helped me with a lot of work in the branches, but also helped me craft my preselection speech. We decided, since I was the 14th speaker out of 15 applicants, that it should be a very brief speech. We put together a very punchy little 4 1/2-minute speech to the preselectors, which clearly impressed them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next indication of some of Bob Pike's philosophical commitments was through one of the first bills that I had something to do with when I arrived in this place, and that was the Australian Securities Commission legislation. Bob had been campaigning against a centralisation of the corporations power for a couple of years before that. I worked very closely with Bob on that legislation. People will recall&mdash;even though those opposite will not have appreciated what happened&mdash;that Bob was quite instrumental in ensuring that the Legislative Council in Western Australia was the only parliament in Australia to defeat the mirror legislation to make Western Australia part of the new Australian Securities Commission centralised corporate scheme. That caused some headaches for a while, but it was a stand on a very good principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that Bob deserves to be thoroughly recognised for were his work&mdash;a lot of senators would recognise this work&mdash;in establishing a very powerful and effective committee system in the Legislative Council in Western Australia. It was somewhat of a surprise to me to know that the committee system in that place was not particularly effective. Bob, when he re-entered parliament at the 1989 election, worked very vigorously to set up a whole series of standing committees, very similar to the legislative standing committees which we have in this place. He did some very good work in establishing those committees, but also, more notably, in establishing select committees that investigated some of the more notorious WA Inc. dealings, which, in the end, one could only say were most instrumental in ensuring that public pressure built up so that there just had to be a royal commission. Even though that was a very costly expense, I think it was a process that needed to be gone through because we hope that it will be a long time before a government does the sorts of dealings that the Burke and Dowding governments entered into. Bob's children and Bob's widow, Patti, can be very proud of the contribution he made there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining to me, I want to make some quite specific comments about Bob's work in the organisation because he did have some very special skills. One of those was something that very few politicians ever do; that is, actually to go out and sign up members. Some people who are detractors of Bob's and mine, and even Senator Crichton-Browne's, would describe the work that Bob did as branch stacking. Effectively, what Bob did was to go out on Saturday afternoons, Sunday mornings and at odd times through the week, knock on people's doors, present himself as a Liberal and ask people to join the Liberal Party. He was very successful at that. Bob Pike and I, probably in about the first month I was in the Senate, went out to a suburb called Hazelmere, which is near Guildford and not a particularly affluent area, but a suburb with some very nice people in it. It is an area where one would not expect a lot of success&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a Sunday morning, Senator McMullan, one would not expect a great hit rate when knocking on people's doors asking them to join the Liberal Party. I went out and knocked on doors for about two hours. I came back to Bob at the appointed meeting time and he said, `How many have you got?' I said, `I have two. How many have you got, Bob?' He said, `I have got 17.' I said to Bob, `I had better come along with you and learn your technique.' I will not record the technique that Bob used, but it was a well practised routine, a sales routine he had crafted and developed over many years. When Bob Pike, Noel Crichton-Browne and Ian Campbell go out door knocking on Sunday mornings&mdash;which I am sad to say will never happen again&mdash;Bob always managed to get 30 or 35 people. I will not report my scores or Noel's, but they were never quite as good as Bob's.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have probably treated this matter a little flippantly but I felt that that experience was important. Indeed, all political parties need to have a broad base of membership. There are very few ways of getting that unless one has paid field officers or shop stewards in unions carrying out that task. It is extremely good for politicians to get out on the streets. I am not just referring to doorknocking at election times, but getting out and asking people to join one's party. I always enjoyed going out on the street doorknocking with Bob seeking membership. It was an educational exercise in itself and I will treasure that experience for the rest of my life. It was very much grassroots politics that Australia has long since left behind. My training from Bob will put me in good stead for years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record for the Senate some of the Pikeisms that I will cherish for the rest of my life. He had some classic sayings with which to greet people. During the Stirling preselection row, and even during my preselection in 1990 when I was successful, he would always be part of the team. When somebody put up their name for preselection, Bob would get on the phone and say, `Ian, I want you to know that you can ring me at any time after five in the morning until midnight any night. I will always be there to help you.' The next morning I would ring him at 5.00 a.m. and could hear him coughing and spluttering at the other end of the phone, but he would always be there to help you. No matter when you rang him, Bob would say, `Top of the morning to you, Pike speaking.' That is something we will never enjoy again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also when we were dealing with complex internecine politics in the Liberal Party, running through various ideas as to how to roll somebody from a branch or how to get somebody installed, Bob would say, `Let's go slow'&mdash;let us slow the conversation down. The next thing he would say was, `Let's put our think caps on.' These are some gentle little Pikeisms that I want to record for posterity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one is that Bob would ring up with some crucially sensitive information and would say, `This is a Bob to Ian conversation.' I was never quite sure what that meant. Obviously it meant not to tell anyone else. I suspect that when Bob said, `This is a Bob to Ian conversation' he really meant to say, `Don't tell Noel.' Sometimes when one was rattling off one's thoughts to Bob and getting a little ahead of him, he would say, `Let me tell you before you tell me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the closing moments of these remarks, I want to put on record Bob's great influence on the Liberal Party, particularly the Liberal Party of Western Australia, and on me personally. No matter how unpopular the cause, he was never afraid to nail his colours to the mast. He would never shillyshally around, but would always make sure that everyone understood his position and would reason it through in an articulate fashion. Bob would ensure that people knew exactly where he stood and the philosophic and principled basis of his belief. He was always keen to speak to his opponents and understand where they were coming from; also to ensure that they understood where he was coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Pike was a very great man. Many senators opposite would not have believed in a lot of what he believed in. Many people from the other side from Western Australia had a great respect for Bob. He made an enormous contribution to the WA Liberal Party and cannot be replaced. Bob has left a wonderful wife and seven children, who were very lucky to have enjoyed the time they had with him. It is very sad that we lost such a great Western Australian, and indeed a great Australian, late on Anzac Day 1994. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to give a brief response to the government's white paper, with particular emphasis on my portfolio responsibilities of industry, trade and regional development. I remind the Senate that the white paper began life as an industry statement which was to be provided by the then minister for industry, the Hon. Alan Griffiths. However, a sandwich shop got in the way and we got this white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats welcome many of the measures on employment, training and income support set out in the white paper. These will give help&mdash;which is only about a decade overdue&mdash;to the victims of long-term unemployment. But where are the other two strategies? There are bits and pieces of industry measures, some quite good, and several of the best have been taken from Australian Democrat policy statements. This signals the fact that a little light might be dawning on the government that it cannot just rely on the economic recovery to deal with Australia's problems. However, the government's policy contains no strategic framework and important components of a coherent industry policy are nowhere to be found. The employment, training and income support measures are a short-term bandaid. But our long-term structural problems require major surgery and the government refuses to pick up the knife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called regional development strategy is worse. It is regional development on the cheap. At $10 million it is an insult. Those parts of regional Australia devastated by the government's destruction of core industries through its level playing field stupidities of the past decade suffer the highest rates of unemployment, much higher than the cities, and have also the highest rates of long-term unemployment and the worst indices of social dislocation in the country. They deserve support. What have they got? `Fix it yourself' says the government. I will return to this disgraceful treatment of regional Australia later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I will address myself to industry policy. On Wednesday last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Professor Heinz Arndt wrote that deficiency in aggregate demand was no longer a major factor in causing unemployment. The problem, he says&mdash;and I believe he is correct&mdash;is structural not cyclical. Despite this, the only strategy the government has in the white paper is to argue that the growth from our current recovery is the solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Arndt cites as primary causes of unemployment the loss of jobs in labour intensive industries to newly industrialising countries; the replacement of labour by technology; job shedding in the name of micro-economic reform. The government has not addressed these structural problems in any coherent way. Last week's entirely predictable $660 million blow-out in imports is just more evidence of that failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that structural problems require structural solutions. Our policies address all three of the structural problems identified by Professor Arndt. Innovation is the key, as correctly identified by the white paper. But having identified this, there is only token and piecemeal support for developing an innovative Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome those measures that were included in the white paper. I refer to reducing the expenditure threshold for the R&amp;D tax concession, which was a Democrat proposal. The measure relating to small business networking and increased funding for CSIRO and other research agencies were again policies that we have been pressing for. There is also support for commercialisation of high technology developed by small firms; and extension of the export markets development grants scheme to the tourism industry, although it is a little miserly to allow only a 25 per cent grant for tourism, which is one of our major growth industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these measures are good, but they are not comprehensive and do not comprise a coherent strategy. If innovation is the key, we should have a national innovation strategy that identifies and addresses all the constraints to innovation and product development. This requires a comprehensive approach to developing the appropriate education base, providing facilities for research and development, access to venture and development capital and a strategic vision of the direction of change. These measures are a central component of new growth theory which has been developed in the Chicago University by, among others, Professor Reich who is currently President Clinton's adviser on industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ideas that we have put forward in our 1994 budget proposals and recent industry statement do address the structural causes of unemployment faced by Australia and do point the way to a coherent strategy to address this problem. We address the bias against labour in the tax system by proposing the phase-out of payroll tax, and tax incentives to small business to employ new staff. We recognise the role of small business as the engine of new job growth through a range of measures&mdash;some titbits were indeed picked up by the government&mdash;such as a proposal for the establishment of a small business loans insurance cooperation, and proposals for reform to company tax collection arrangements for small business. We have proposed a return to quarterly tax collection, no company tax payments for companies with incomes below $400,000 before September each year and a reduction in the uplift factor for provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the government not adopted these measures? The loss of jobs must be addressed and we must start in our labour intensive, import competing industries. We need a two-year pause in tariff reductions. We need better small business access to the export markets development scheme by reducing the expenditure threshold. We need packages of assistance targeted to industries needing transitional assistance, or to get new industries up and running. We need a $10 million pilot venture capital development fund to provide equity to new small businesses. We require superannuation funds to invest one per cent of their portfolios in venture capital and research and development syndicates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improving the economy and providing jobs for people who are now out of work starts with consumers. What we should now be concentrating on&mdash;and I signal a strong emphasis on this for the next 12 months by the Democrats&mdash;is a strong `buy Australian' campaign. It would include a review of labelling laws and reforms that would allow Australians a real choice to support their own industries by knowing clearly what sort of product they are buying. We will be looking to the government to implement even more actively and more positively the Bevis recommendations on government purchasing, and we will be looking for tougher anti-dumping measures. We have proposed these measures and we will be pushing them during the next 12 months in the context of a strategic view of industry needs. It is rather sad that the government has not provided that sort of vision in its white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third structural cause of unemployment identified by Professor Arndt is the loss of jobs through so-called micro-economic reform. Government business enterprises criminally have shed over 80,000 staff over the past three years. It is time to recognise the government's own role as an employer. It is about time that labour productivity gains in the public sector were used to expand services instead of cutting staff. It is time that public sector enterprises were again run for the benefit of the community rather than mindlessly privatised and sold for a song, as the government intends to do in the case of AIDC. It is time we started seeing an increase in public infrastructure spending from its current 40-year low to provide the services and structure needed by industry and by regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats, by contrast, have proposed a $1.2 billion program of rebuilding Australia's neglected infrastructure. Why has the government not addressed this cause of structural unemployment? The blind faith in market forces and level playing field fantasies that have dominated the government's thinking for the last decade make it clear why it somehow manages to believe that it is efficient and that it has been Australia's single largest job shedder. We have put forward a comprehensive strategy that addresses the structural problems of our industry. The most important features of that strategy are a commitment to innovation and a recognition of the lesson from our international competitors that targeted government assistance based on industry plans agreed between workers, industry and government is the way to develop competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession has hit regional Australia much harder than urban areas. Core regional industries have been decimated by government policies. Unemployment rates are at 18 per cent in small towns which are shrinking, and government services are being cut with them. Young people are leaving for the cities and social dislocation, including suicide rates, is rife. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Wednesday the government brought down a document called Working Nation&mdash;its white paper on how to solve the problems of unemployment in this country. This was supposed to be another of Paul Keating's great policy initiatives but, in reality, it continues in the long line of failed policies in the area of unemployment over the last 11 years of this government. When we recall those particular initiatives such as One Nation, all the May economic statements and all the budgets, we find that they have failed to deliver anything like a proper employment level in this country. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that this is the one that is the panacea, this is the one that by the year 2000 will reduce unemployment in this country by five per cent. It will have to work a lot better than the previous ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on one aspect of that white paper, an area which surprisingly was buried way towards the back of the paper. Given all the hype that was around about what was going to be done by this government for rural Australia, it is absolutely amazing that it got such scant attention. We had to look very hard at the white paper to find anything of any great significance for regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems as though what the government has decided finally is that fixing the problems of regional Australia is going to be so time consuming and costly that, really, it will not bother at all. But look at the problem that we have. We have an unemployment rate in this country of 10.3 per cent, but in the regional areas of Australia we find this figure skyrockets. In the Hunter region we have 16.1 per cent unemployment. It is higher in Newcastle at 16.4 per cent. The north coast of New South Wales in my area has long, persistent and entrenched unemployment levels of 17 per cent. What hope is there in this paper for people in those areas, the ones who have heard of the Kelty report, the ones who put in submissions? A large amount of time and effort was put into compiling a document and making recommendations that this white paper was supposed to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was, to me, a great pity that the press did not focus, as it often does not do, on the failures of this government. It looked at the general treatment of unemployment, but I saw very little attention paid in the press to what is one of the most pressing needs in this country, and that is solving the problem of unemployment in regional Australia. The government set up a task force to do it, but the net effect of what the task force has done is to not deliver for the people of rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did regional Australia get out of the $6.5 billion over four years? It got $270 million over four years across the whole of regional Australia. Yet as the McKinsey report found, 41 per cent of the regions covered in the rural areas are in terminal decline. In effect, what the government has done in this report&mdash;and the Prime Minister not only admits it; he almost boasts about it&mdash;is to let it go and pass the buck over to the local authorities. Honourable senators will recall that in his speech he cited two regions. He talked about Goulburn Valley and Sunraysia and what was being done in the northern areas of Victoria. He outlined the government's plans and talked about the doubling of product in those areas. But it was not because of anything he was doing; it was because of the efforts of the local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the nature of the programs in areas like Sunraysia, we realise that what they are really on about in those areas is desalination. If the salt problem in these areas can be got rid of, it will boost productivity enormously straightaway. So the Prime Minister is giving a very misleading impression in the one example that he cited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the role of the federal government in all of that? It plans to put in a few capital works to back up what the local authorities are doing. I would have thought that since the time of Federation, and even in the times of the colonies, it was seen as the natural role of government to put in capital works to back up local initiatives. In other words, this white paper is doing absolutely nothing for regional Australia. As a matter of fact, the figure of $270 million across the whole of regional Australia over the next four years is probably showing that the government is drawing resources out of regional Australia, not putting extra into it. It was all too hard for the government, so in effect it has given up on regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what the government has done for one of the major problems in rural Australia, that is, transport. The white paper provides $10 million in 1994-95 and then $20 million over the next three years&mdash;$70 million completely for infrastructure in response to what the Kelty report saw as probably the major initiative that was needed in regional and rural Australia. This is what it provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most amazing things, in light of what has happened so far, is that the government's main response seems to be to set up another committee. It has decided to create the national transport planning task force&mdash;another committee. We have had the Kelty report, the McKinsey report and the Industry Commission report and, as a result of all those exhaustive findings, what does the government say? It says, `We will set up the national transport planning task force'&mdash;anything to avoid spending money on these regions and doing anything about the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not really need to set up another report because the McKinsey report identified that all levels of government need to be involved in proper labour market reform, in deregulating transport, in improving infrastructure and in minimising red tape. We did not really need a government report to tell us that&mdash;we have known that for years&mdash;but the government has again squibbed it and done nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to bring in one measure which we realise, when we have a close look at it, is really just part of the old, failed One Nation package. It has recycled what it was going to do in investment with pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. It is trying very hard to make these more attractive to investors. It has not worked so far, and the government is going to try to make it slightly more attractive. Whether that succeeds, we will see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional Australia has major problems. The government, in this white paper, has really just thrown a pittance at those problems. We will be reminding the people of regional Australia of this right up until the next election. </PARA>

The Industry Commission said that the Government needed to make regions more attractive to capital by improving regional infrastructure. The McKinsey Report said that business had real concerns about Government commitment to infrastructure. The Kelty Report proposed dozens of needed infrastructure projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did we get? $10 million this year for two `demonstration' projects. Now the Australian Democrats pushed very hard for, and support the two projects in Goulburn Valley and Sunraysia. However, this picture of regional Australia launching into a boom based on thousands of people coming from all over Australia to be inspired by what's happening in Mildura and Echuca is not one that gives me a lot of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Kelty called for a commitment to equal access to basic infrastructure for all Australians, with special assistance to remote areas&mdash;an admirable set of goalposts, but the government seems to be kicking the ball in the other direction. Why has the Government so completely dumped the results of the Kelty Report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is relying, it claims, on the private sector to build regional Australia's infrastructure. The history of private sector support for regional infrastructure would suggest this belief ranks slightly ahead of a belief in the Tooth Fairy and slightly behind the Easter Bunny. Of course, the Government will claim that this fantasy can be made reality through the bit of tinkering it has done to the tax-breaks on infrastructure bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the changes to the infrastructure bonds. We hope they work. But there are two fundamental flaws in this approach. The private sector doesn't build the sort of infrastructures communities need, because most of the benefits from a lot of infrastructure are social and not capturable by private industry. The private sector is never a great provider of schools, hospitals, and community services, and doesn't have that much better a record in provision of transport infrastructure. The other problem with the approach is that it doesn't recognise that the reason the private sector doesn't like major infrastructure projects isn't the return&mdash;it's the risk. If the Government is really serious about generating private involvement in infrastructure, it at least needs to look at some Government equity or insurance against completion risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the breath-taking lack of support for regional infrastructure, what else did we get? The Democrats support the financing for Regional Economic Development Organisations, but without support for infrastructure projects, their effectiveness will be limited. We also support the Regional Environment Employment Program. But that's about it, really.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had called for a $50 million package to maintain Government services in hard-hit rural areas. Where is it? We had called for a 12-month extension to the Investment Allowance for rural producers&mdash;where is it? For years the injustice of rural families not being able to get access to assistance such as Basic and Family Payments because of the paper value of the family farm has been well documented. We called for the exemption of the family farm from the assets test. The failure of the Government to act on this proposal is nothing less than heartless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And the most amazing gap of all is that there is not one mention in the entire White Paper of the higher costs faced by country dwellers for petrol and other basics. Did the Government put together a regional development package without visiting the regions? It's pretty hard to talk to anyone outside of metropolitan Australia without finding out that these price disparities are about the single biggest issue on their minds.</PARA>

Vibrant regions are therefore an appropriate social goal and, as a nation, we have to recognise that we have to pay to achieve that goal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The UN Security Council, in a letter to the UN Secretary General dated 20 September 1993, expressed deep disappointment that an agreement had not been reached in talks based on the Secretary-General's Set of Ideas, and called on the Turkish Cypriot side to give its support to the effort to secure an agreement on the package.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government is aware that a number of Australian citizens were expelled from their properties in northern Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In 1975, the Turkish Cypriot administration announced that it would accept property claims from "third party states", that is from individuals not of Greek or Greek Cypriot origin. Most claims lodged by this category of persons, and which could be verified by production of a title deed, have now been settled. Property claims by persons of Greek or Greek Cypriot extraction, or with any Greek or Greek Cypriot links (such as Greek financing of the original purchase), have not been accepted by the Turkish Cypriot administration. While Australian citizens in general are not targeted for special treatment, citizens and residents of Australia of Greek or Greek Cypriot extraction are denied access to the north, as are residents and citizens of other countries of Greek or Greek Cypriot extraction. The question of granting legal aid to Australian citizens, whether citizens at the time of the Turkish invasion or not, is one more appropriately directed to the Attorney-General. A comprehensive negotiated settlement based on the UN Secretary-General's Set of Ideas and which makes provision for the recovery of or compensation for property expropriated, rather than litigation, remains the best hope for those Australian citizens dispossessed in 1974.</PARA>
