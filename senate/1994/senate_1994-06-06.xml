<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer to last week's national accounts, which show that manufacturing is the fastest growing part of the economy, with factory production rising by 9.7 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in the year to March 1994. I ask the minister: how have the government's tariff reduction program and industry policy settings impacted on this growth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1284" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quarterly accounts that came out last week showed for the economy an annual growth rate of five per cent in the quarter ended in March. The trend figure, which I think sensibly the Treasurer has focused on, is 4.3 per cent growth. There is no doubt now that the Australian economy is growing strongly and that we are as an economy the envy of the OECD world. The Business Council of Australia's investment survey figures which have just been published at least confound the critics in the opposition who say that 14 1/2 per cent growth in investment is not possible. The BCA figures out this weekend show that indeed the budget forecast is on track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Factory production for the year ending March 1994 grew by 9.7 per cent, seasonally adjusted. That is the strongest growth of any sector in this quarter's quarterly accounts. Manufacturing output has grown in Australia now for the seventh consecutive quarter, and that means that we are experiencing in this country very strong manufacturing growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, which is of course a reforming government, recognises that its reforms have worked. The key to our economic restructuring has been the phasing down in a careful way of tariff protection to expose the Australian manufacturing sector to international competition, to cause it to become leaner and more competitive and at a rate at which it does not burn out the competitiveness of our manufacturing sector, unlike what the proposal in the Fightback manifesto of Dr Hewson would have done. Ours has been a careful and targeted reformation of tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two best performing sub-sectors within manufacturing, interestingly, in the March quarter accounts have been clothing and footwear and the transport sector which includes automobile manufacture. The clothing and footwear sector grew in the quarter to March by 23 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure what Senator Margetts is on about. That sector grew by 23 per cent; maybe she objects to that. The transport sector, including manufactures of motor vehicles, grew by 12 per cent in that quarter. It was said that if tariff reform was attempted in these areas, both sectors would be killed off entirely. Well, they have not been; they are flourishing. That reflects not only the right framework by the government, but also corporate leadership by the industries within this sector and a degree of cooperation in their workplace reform targets. All stakeholders in these sectors have performed very well and the government acknowledges that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last Thursday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Bill Scales, the former head of the Automotive Industry Authority and current Chairman of the Industry Commission, in drawing the link between the government's industry policies and increases in productivity in these sectors, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they have not only begun to displace imports, but they have also become an important part of Australia's export effort.</PARA>
<PARA>In the automotive sector, 1993 was a record year, with exports of $1.5 billion. Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd plans to upgrade its two Adelaide plants, with a possible investment of $500 million in that area. The policy is also a driving force in the clothing and footwear industries. Just one example is the 100-year-old Victorian company, the Stafford Group, which manufactures men's suits. It is now growing strongly and plans substantial investment in the very near future. Yesterday, ACI confirmed a deal to buy $400 million worth of ethane from the Cooper Basin, increasing the value added in that industry. The significant thing about these figures is strong growth underpinned by strong reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, not surprisingly, is about the Northern Territory election. Will the minister retract his own hasty comments and reject Brian Ede's emotional claims that the Australian Labor Party's seventh consecutive election loss since 1974 in the Northern Territory was due to racial issues? When will Senator Collins and other Labor apologists stop insulting the intelligence of the electorate and accept that the poll result was due to Labor's incompetence and interference from Canberra, including such stupid policies as the three-mine uranium policy and taxes forcing high costs in remote areas?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that actually constitutes a complete answer. There were two issues fundamental to the Northern Territory election campaign. One was economic management, which territorians share with the rest of the country. The territory's economic management is very simple: the federal Labor government provides the money, and the Northern Territory government spends it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does this federal Labor government&mdash;due, I might add, to the excellent representation it has in Canberra by the federal member for the Northern Territory and me&mdash;provide 80 per cent of the global funding for the Northern Territory's budget, which is frittered away on such things as a $160 million Parliament House for a parliament of 25 members, which sits for 30 days out of 365, but also we plough hundreds of millions of dollars of funding into the Northern Territory in the defence budget alone. Indeed, I have seen calculations which estimate that the Northern Territory's unemployment levels would be 17 per cent without the injection of just the defence funding that the Labor government in Canberra allocates to the Northern Territory. The other fundamental issue is that, sadly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Those opposite do not like the answer. As a long-term territorian committed to spending the rest of my life in the Northern Territory&mdash;if I intended to retire somewhere else, as unfortunately so many territorians still do, I probably would not feel so bad about it&mdash;it saddens me deeply that the Northern Territory government has campaigned consistently on racial issues for the 20 years that I have been a Northern Territory politician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to answer Senator Tambling's question directly, I refer all honourable senators, including Senator Tambling, to the front page lead story of the territory's only daily newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News,</EMPHASIS> on day one of the campaign, and it is an accurate report. The story is headlined&mdash;and this is the opening of a 17-day campaign&mdash;`Poll opens with race row'. The two lead paragraphs are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NT election campaign blasted off yesterday with a row on Aboriginal policies.</PARA>

<PARA>That was the front page lead story on day one of the Northern Territory election campaign, which accurately singled out the fact that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, at his press conference that launched the campaign, singled out racial issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, on World Environment Day, I did announce that I had approved funding of $6 million to improve the state of Australia's rivers. This is the first part of $10 million funding promised in the Prime Minister's environment statement for the national river health program&mdash;a program which has been established to get a national handle on the state of our river systems, to identify where the major problems lie, and to work out where our resources will most effectively be targeted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the health of Australia's river catchments is vital. Our rivers are threatened by the large and competing demands of agricultural and urban users. We see the effects of this competition in reduced water flow, increasing pollution, salinity, and problems that Senator West has drawn attention to before, such as algal blooms. We need access to more detailed, timely and precise information about Australia's freshwater systems if we are going to manage our water resources effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is a growing body of information on the physical and chemical characteristics of our rivers and streams, we still lack critical biological information. There will be $3.5 million used by the states and territories to develop a national system for assessing river health and for integrating biological monitoring with existing water quality monitoring by the states and territories at 1,000 key sites across Australia. The new national system will monitor the health of aquatic life in the rivers, providing a yardstick to measure the effectiveness of catchment management programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional $2.5 million will be provided to research organisations. This will enable research to improve scientific understanding of the water flows which are necessary for healthy rivers and their inhabitants. The projects will cover areas such as the effects of river flows on nuisance algae, aquatic systems and the water requirements for flood plains and their flora and fauna. The national river health program is an excellent example of Commonwealth, state and territory governments and research organisations all pitching in and working cooperatively to tackle a major national environmental concern&mdash;the water quality of Australian rivers. This complements the programs that are already in existence which enable local communities to watch over their rivers and streams. I commend this program to the Senate.</PARA>

I am now in my seventh year as a minister, and no request by a member of parliament to have access to any of the departments or authorities over which I have had portfolio responsibility has ever been denied.

Why do visitors to Australia require visas and does the government intend to change its approach on this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1288" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am aware of Mr Brown's comments. Sadly, as Senator Cooney's question might reflect, those comments reflect a profound ignorance not only of recent developments in relation to visa processing and business migration but also the whole rationale for our universal visa system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, Mr Brown claimed that we are being seen as racist because we require visitors from Asia to obtain visas. The reality is that this is a ludicrous suggestion. The fact is that our non-discriminatory universal visa policy requires all people, with the exception of New Zealand passport holders, to obtain visas before coming to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing racist about that. It is a policy which has had bipartisan support, still has it, and is applied in the same way all over the world. To appreciate this system even better, Mr Brown should understand that the visa system is a critical part of the overall entry facilitation and border control management of the Australian system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main benefits of having such a non-discriminatory universal system is that the bulk of the entry processing for travellers is done not on arrival in Australia, but overseas at the point of visa issue. In effect, the visa practically guarantees entry to Australia for someone who has one. By contrast, a visa free entry would mean transferring the process involved in visa issue from overseas to the airports in Australia, which would place an extra burden on facilities at the airports, would create delays and would mean unnecessary inconvenience for passengers. In that context I should note also that the assessments are that visa processing onshore takes about 90 seconds&mdash;processing of people when they come to Australia takes, on the average, 90 seconds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown also went on to say that the need for visas is doing incalculable damage to business and tourism. He should know that this is contradicted by the figures, which show a dramatic increase in the number of visas issued in many Asian countries over recent years. Indonesia and Singapore are great examples of that. The growth rate has been 40 per cent in those countries; whilst in Korea it has been some 60 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brown also mentioned the area of business migration and temporary residence. He seems to be unaware that as recently as last month the government introduced some major reforms to facilitate the entry of business visitors and migrants. The arrangements for visa issue are, of course, kept under constant review to ensure that we maintain high standards and to ensure that we maintain standards of service to both tourism and business persons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that extent, my department is now working on a new electronic visa issuing system which is designed to simplify visa issue so that it is almost invisible to the traveller. In fact, I was asked a question about this in the Senate three or four weeks ago and I announced then all the details of that electronic visa issuing system. Under that system no written application would be required and no visa would be placed in the passport. But the system would ensure that on arrival passengers continue to be processed quickly and efficiently through our airports. As I say, it is a continuation of the visa system, but it is a new electronic visa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also state for the record, in refuting Mr Brown's allegations, that I am informed that no government in the world has asked us to do away with our visa system. In conclusion, Mr Brown would be better served by finding ways of attracting more tourists and business migrants to South Australia. I have already said a number of times that I am prepared to cooperate with him in doing so. Mr Brown and South Australia would be better served if he did that as opposed to making half-cocked comments without apprising himself of the facts.</PARA>

Is it true that if the spending on health research were sustained at the same proportion as currently the expenditure would have been $716 million?

Did the former minister for health claim that an extra $92 million would be committed to medical research in this year's budget&mdash;what Senator Richardson described in this place as the biggest single increase in funding for medical research since federation?

In the budget the government has also provided an additional $93 million over four years for health research through the NHMRC, which maintains the base funding for medical research and provides a dramatic increase in funding to $9 million in 1995, increasing to $13 million in 1996-97.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Although I accept what the minister is saying that two per cent of something difficult is actually difficult for the Labor government, the fact is, surely, as I think the minister has confirmed, that the $92 million that was promised by Senator Richardson has not been met and that, indeed, the actual figure is something like $9 million according to the Access Economics documents and all the rest of the funding, to quote the budget papers, is simply to restore funding in the NHMRC base, which was due to lapse at the end of 1994, and for additional research for the NHMRC.

Senator Woods himself said that that is a promise in this budget process for money in the outyears, and we have had a debate about whether or not this is new money on other issues of concern in this place. It quite clearly is a commitment to further increasing the outlays. An amount of $93 million over four years is an increase of large new money into research, particularly of the NHMRC. It is difficult to say what that two per cent figure is&mdash;and I think I have dealt with that&mdash;but there is quite clearly an increase in money. It is not merely $9 million. If Senator Woods wants to conclude that, then he has it wrong. There is a bigger increase than that this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the story in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and I want to make the comment that the emphasis in the story about a review only of Standards Australia is not correct. This morning I released a statement in detail which announces a review of Australia's standards and conformance infrastructure and which gives the full details of the terms of reference, the membership of the committee to carry out the review and its reporting date of January of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement makes it quite clear that this review, which was first indicated in the white paper statement on industry early in May, will take place. It will deal not just with Standards Australia but with the whole structure of standards and conformance infrastructure in Australia. It will have a look at and receive submissions from bodies such as Standards Australia, industry and the community. It will deal with and look at the structure of organisations in Australia that play a role in standard setting, such as Standards Australia, NATA, the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand, the National Standards Commission and the National Measurement Laboratories; a whole range of bodies that have been developed over the last 50 years&mdash;or more in some cases&mdash;to provide this standards setting role for Australian industry and the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in recent times there has been some controversy amongst these organisations about how standards are set and about the difference between providing a commercial and competitive service to industry and those standards that should be provided in the national interest. There has been some dispute between these organisations about how that is to be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industry has made it clear that it wants a simple, transparent system that is cost competitive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of preventive action to stop further massacres, the international action that is primarily taking place at the moment is diplomatic, with endeavours not only by the UN but also by the Organisation of African Unity and regional governments, most recently those meeting in Harare, to broker a permanent cease-fire and to resume the Arusha peace process. Regrettably, those diplomatic activities so far have largely come to naught and it does remain a matter of speculation as to whether they are going to be any more successful in the days and weeks immediately ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That then raises the question, as Senator Harradine put it, of some kind of interventionist activity by the international community in the nature of what we describe as a peace enforcement operation. The difficulty about that, however, remains what has always been the difficulty in the UN's consideration of that in recent weeks. I think everybody acknowledges that a force of quite a considerable number of troops and other personnel&mdash;maybe of the order of magnitude of 20,000, 30,000 or indeed even 40,000 troops&mdash;would be required for such an operation to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unhappy reality is that all the indications are that the will is just not there in the international community&mdash;among the permanent five members of the UN, the other members of the Security Council or other major potential donors&mdash;to enable that kind of an enforcement operation to take place. So, if we are talking about the inability to mount an enforcement action, either through UN auspices or through other regional African governments, for example, what we are left with is something in the nature of a peacekeeping operation or a smaller scale operation simply designed to identify and protect particular enclaves in the border area or elsewhere, to enable physical protection to be given to people within those enclaves and to enable the supplies of relief goods to them. That is, of course, the concept of operations that is presently being developed by the UN and hopefully it will bear some fruit in the next few days in terms of a workable concept that we and other countries can respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to be responsive in a sympathetic way to this situation, which is appalling. But, as I have said on a number of occasions, one can run a peacekeeping operation or a humanitarian support operation of this kind only if it is essentially limited in scope and carefully defined, and the resources are in fact there to enable it to be done properly. One can run a peace enforcement operation only if very much larger-scale resources are available. Regrettably, it does not appear as if that condition will be able to be satisfied.

This is something we are all deeply concerned about. But I have to say that, sitting here where we are and not being in a position to influence the larger course of events except by discussion at the margin, we are essentially prisoners of the action that others are willing to take. The situation so far as others are concerned who are in a better position to influence the course of events is as I have described it.

As the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission has evidence of telephone calls prior to the senator's resignation from parliament between Karlos and Richardson, including calls to Richardson's home and Sydney office, and evidence of many calls to New South Wales crime figure Lenny McPherson, who is alleged to have financed the services, why has the government not asked the Australian Federal Police to ensure that there has not been a breach of section 73 of the Crimes Act, which concerns corruption and bribery of members of parliament, and that the interests of the government have not been compromised in this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to staff at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>My question referred to what I will call the suppression of CSIRO scientists, because I think that is the correct term. Let me first of all assure the minister, absolutely, that I have not approached one single CSIRO scientist in recent days for any information whatsoever. CSIRO scientists in Western Australia, Queensland, the ANU here in Canberra and all around the country have been coming out of the woodwork complaining to me&mdash;and, I think, the opposition as well&mdash;by expressing their concern about the absolutely shabby deal that this government is dishing up to the CSIRO at the moment and their concern that whole divisions and whole institutes of the CSIRO will be shut down if, in fact, something is not done, and not done urgently. So let me assure the minister that the scientists have been approaching me; I have not approached them at all. But, having said that, I feel I have a perfect right to approach any of them for any information at all, and I believe that they have a perfect right to speak to me if I do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, let me describe to the minister exactly what happened this morning. A very senior scientist from the CSIRO rang up and told me that his more senior person rang him and said, `You are not to speak to any politician without one of Minister Cook's staff being present.' This senior scientist asked his chief, `Can I have that in writing?' He was told, `Of course you can't because it would be straight off the back of a truck.' The minister has simply spoken to senior people in the CSIRO&mdash;he did not instruct them, he just spoke to them. But he obviously spoke to them in such a way that it has instilled a considerable amount of fear in the hearts of very senior people in the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This smacks of the very worst aspects of Stalinist Russia. Do honourable senators remember Lysenko, who had a particular and very peculiar theory about evolution? For years and years Russian science was suppressed because of directives that came down from on top as to what exactly Russian scientists could say. Scientists have to be free; they must not receive instruction from ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minister's reply, also, he clearly indicated that information must pass from scientists through senior CSIRO people and through his office because he is the responsible minister. Again, in view of his replies in recent days to questions on funding of the CSIRO, we know that the minister is filtering the information. We know that this minister is not giving a fair and accurate account to this parliament of what is happening to the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That degree of filtering of information is again totally unacceptable with any government department, and particularly unacceptable with those statutory organisations which I understood had some degree of freedom with respect to the way in which they dealt with information. Is the minister saying that David Hill of the ABC, for instance, is not permitted to come to speak to members of parliament? Let me assure the minister that David Hill comes and speaks to the Democrats quite frequently. Do the minister or his colleague intend to issue another directive that David Hill and other senior people in the ABC cannot come to speak to us? I certainly hope that is not the case because, if it is, it certainly indicates that we are descending into the worst sort of dictatorship this country has probably ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if the minister takes such a narrow view of the responsibility of scientists which says that scientists must have their information filtered through senior people in CSIRO and then filtered through his department, then I personally will undertake a campaign to see that the minister does not continue in that portfolio. </PARA>

I did say that other members of parliament have done so. They have walked into CSIRO meetings, sat down and then wanted to participate as though they were entitled to. That is not an appropriate way of conducting business. I said that a member of parliament in this place had telephoned a senior CSIRO officer and tried to inveigle that person to come out and make criticisms of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to have some sort of obvious, clear understanding about where things go in a matter like this. As I said, I did speak quite forthrightly to the Executive Director of the CSIRO about how the affairs of CSIRO are governed in this respect. As a consequence of that discussion I understand that he, of his own motion, has put forward a proposal. He is responsible for the administration of the corporation and he is the right person so to do: his right to do it should be protected and acknowledged by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to see CSIRO, as Australia's premier science institute, free to do its job and not to be made a political football by members of this parliament with axes to grind in order to promote their own vested self-interest. The CSIRO is an organisation with an international reputation par excellence. We have seen over recent weeks efforts to try to drag it down and turn it into a political argument simply to suit members of this parliament. That is a disgrace. To try to distract the attention of research scientists from their research work in order to play political games is also a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter says that people are not free to speak their minds. Let me remind the Senate that in answering the question earlier I said that in my seven years as a minister any requests by a member of parliament to speak to a department or an agency for which I have ministerial responsibility have never been denied. If any request comes forward I am sure I will facilitate it. Only last week I wrote to Dr Hewson, my new shadow minister in industry, and to Senator Hill, my new shadow in science, inviting them for a briefing on the department on the issues in which they have shadow portfolio responsibility. That is the right and decent thing to do. I extended it voluntarily without being invited. I did not invite Senator Coulter because he has been the shadow minister in this area for a long time, well before I came on to the scene. But that is the right and proper thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What objection do people in this place or the other place have to having an independent notetaker when they are making their inquiries? I do not want scientists with a huge responsibility to this country being seen individually without an independent record of that conversation being available. Without it, they could be misrepresented or their words, innocently offered, turned around and used as political cannon fodder. That would be a desecration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not being told what to say. Their right to speak in accordance with their professional duty is protected and enshrined. That is a fundamental right. All that is being sought here is an independent record&mdash;not necessarily made by one of my officers; it could be done by someone else in the CSIRO&mdash;so that those scientist cannot be used as political footballs, their expertise drawn into a tawdry political exercise for the sake of the self-promotion of some members of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer the Senate to page 9 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and an article entitled, `How Green Can a Black Afford to Be?' In that article, very real concerns are raised in relation to the interaction of native title and the operation of national parks in this country. In fact, in relation to Peter Garrett it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He says there are legitimate questions about the protection of endangered species and he describes the green-black relationship as a fluid dynamic.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that national parks could be the subject of a native title claim. The only question that remains is what the effect will be should such a claim succeed. That was the reason for my question to Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the matter is as clear cut as Senator Evans might believe. First, we have the question of access in section 212, as he pointed out. I put it to the Senate that the problem&mdash;and I look at section 212 in addressing this problem&mdash;is that any law of the Commonwealth confirming any existing public access under this section does not extinguish or impair any native title rights. The question is, how does that public access fit in with the relevant native title right or title? That question still has to be determined by the courts. It could go one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important is the question of the environment and the exercise of native title in relation to national parks. I submit that state and Commonwealth legislation fall into two different areas. Firstly, we have Commonwealth legislation falling under acts attributable to the Commonwealth, namely our past category A act, which is validated, and, secondly, state legislation which may validate only on the same principles as the Commonwealth. What I am saying basically is that it is not altogether clear as to what effect state legislation would have over national parks, so that if we have some state legislation protecting flora and fauna in the national park, or acts which can be done in the national park, and that legislation is inconsistent with native title which has been granted, there could well be problems. </PARA>

Some of these animals, such as turtles, are not in great abundance. I understand why Aborigines are allowed to hunt and fish those animals, because they have always done so. But what we are doing here is possibly opening up a great problem in relation to the environment versus native title. We are now seeing native title claims being brought in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland in areas where one might not have expected them to be readily made. Nonetheless they are being made and they raise these questions&mdash;and I put those questions to Senator Evans on what I believe is a sound basis. </PARA>

From the outbreak of war until 1941 he served in 21st Light Horse (Riverina) Regiment. He then enlisted in the RAAF and served in England and New Guinea. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and was discharged in 1945, holding the rank of flight lieutenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not surprising that David Fairbairn looked to federal politics as an arena where he could make a further contribution to public life. Politics was in his blood: both grandfathers, Edmund Jowett and Sir George Fairbairn, had been federal parliamentarians and his uncle James Fairbairn was the Minister for Air and Civil Aviation in the first Menzies United Australia Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn entered the House of Representatives in 1949 as a member of the Menzies Liberal government. He was elected to the newly redistributed New South Wales seat of Farrer, which is currently held by the National Party Leader, Tim Fischer. It is interesting to note that the seat has been held by only three members in its 45-year history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn's capabilities were recognised as he served in a variety of ministerial portfolios during his federal parliamentary career. He was Minister for the Air from 1962 to 1964. He then served as Minister for National Development from 1964 to 1969. One of his many legacies from that time is the Fairbairn dam, which was constructed as part of the 1968 Emerald irrigation scheme. The scheme was designed to develop the agricultural potential of central Queensland. The construction of the dam provided a huge boost to that region, allowing for the development of irrigated crops such as cotton, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, sorghum and barley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1971 David Fairbairn was appointed Minister for Education and Science before taking over defence, which he held until the end of 1972. During David Fairbairn's term as defence minister, he oversaw significant changes to the defence forces, including closer integration between the three services and a structural overhaul of the army&mdash;with the replacement of a geographic command base by a functional command base consisting of operations, logistics and training&mdash;which was a progressive step towards the existing command structure today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn retired from federal politics in 1975 after successfully contesting 11 elections and serving the constituents of Farrer well for 25 years. With his appointment as ambassador to the Hague he continued to serve the Australian people for a further three years. In 1980 David Fairbairn returned to Canberra from his post in the Netherlands and embarked on a much-deserved retirement after dedicating 40 years of his life in public service in a wide variety of roles. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to David Fairbairn's family and many friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate the Australian Democrats with the condolence motion before the Senate today. Sir David Fairbairn was by all accounts a much admired man and a politician who commanded respect from many quarters. His contributions to public life extended over many years and involved service in a number of senior ministries in both the Menzies and the McMahon coalition governments. Although he is probably most remembered for his 1969 leadership challenge to the then Liberal Party leader, John Gorton, and for his subsequent decision not to serve as a minister in the Gorton government, he nevertheless remained absolutely committed to the Liberal Party and to the promotion of the government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn came from one of those families which is steeped in a long tradition of involvement in government. Both his grandfathers, Edmund Jowett and Sir George Fairbairn, served in the first Australian federal parliament. His uncle, James Fairbairn, also entered politics and served as Minister for Air in the Menzies administration. It was this uncle, of course, who was killed in that most unfortunate circumstance when, in 1940, he died in an aeroplane crash here in the Canberra region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn entered politics at the 1949 general election when he was elected as the member for the federal seat of Farrer in New South Wales. He represented his electorate until his retirement in 1975. During his long career in parliament, Sir David distinguished himself by service in a great number of areas, including as Minister for Air, Minister for National Development, Minister for Education and Science, and Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from a number of sources that Sir David was an active minister who ensured an ongoing and vigorous contribution to the decision making process in his time in government. It has been noted, for instance, that he played a central role in the standardisation of the rail gauge on the Sydney, Melbourne, Albury and Adelaide train routes. As Minister for Education and Science, Sir David was also involved in the decision surrounding Australia's conversion from the imperial to the metric system in the early 1970s. In this regard, Sir David displayed a remarkable ability to foresee the debate on future public policy options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir David was a vocal advocate for the teaching of Asian studies in Australian schools, and he was clearly ahead of his time</PARA>
<PARA>in this debate at a time when such notions were still fairly unconventional. I should note that the Australian Democrats would probably have differed a little with his endorsement and active promotion of nuclear power as a future energy source. Nevertheless, Sir David's long service to the community deserves to be recognised today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout his political career he displayed a strong commitment to his country and a determination to further those policies which he believed would better Australian society. Even after his retirement from politics, Sir David continued to serve his country in the capacity of Australia's ambassador to the Hague in the late 1970s. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I offer his family our deepest sympathy at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words on this condolence motion to the honourable Sir David Fairbairn, KBE, DFC and MA. I had the pleasure of knowing David Fairbairn just a little in the 1960s when he was a senior member of the Menzies government, subsequently of the Holt and Gorton governments, and then when he was back again in the McMahon government. In the mid-1960s I spent a couple of years working with the late Harold Holt and it was mainly in that connection that I came into contact with David Fairbairn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of his career has been outlined today by other speakers. I do not wish to go into those details again other than to say that he was, I think, a very underrated man in many ways. He was an influential politician and a person who, apart from politics, made a significant contribution to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not generally known that Sir David was a very talented farmer who won awards for farming through his work in developing his property. He was also, as has been said, a distinguished service person during the Second World War. He served with the RAAF for several years, and fought and flew in England and New Guinea. He was badly wounded towards the end of the war, was discharged in 1945 with the rank of flight lieutenant, and was awarded a DFC for his war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was obviously a person who enjoyed flying. In fact, in his early parliamentary days he used to fly himself to and from parliament. Reports of that time record that, as he flew home at the end the parliamentary week, on occasions he would fly his plane over and buzz the old Parliament House. Some of us would think that perhaps he should have done more than that, but he was a person who obviously enjoyed flying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the record, at the descriptions of David Fairbairn by those who knew him and at the reports that one reads of him, certain words seem to come through very regularly. He was a quiet, earnest and courteous man; a man of complete and never-questioned integrity, and a man who was widely respected by friends, acquaintances and the wider community alike, including in particular his political opponents which is, I think, a good mark of the assessment and judgment of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of Sir David's ministerial work was notable. He is credited with having pushed through the Menzies cabinet the decision to institute the Ord River scheme. The Fairbairn Dam has been mentioned. He was also, as I think Senator Bourne mentioned, a strong advocate of the development of nuclear power stations in Australia. Indeed, at the time he was talking about them in the late 1960s nuclear power was seen as something that would probably be necessary and desirable for Australia. It was for that reason that he was responsible for putting to the government, and the government of the day imposing, restrictions on the export of uranium so that it could be retained for our own domestic purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn was obviously a very hard working minister and a man of wide interests. He was a low profile minister but nonetheless a very influential minister at a time of great development in Australia. To his widow Ruth Fairbairn, who I believe was a driving force behind him in his parliamentary career and a great support to him, and to her family, I join my party and all representatives here in extending my deep sympathy at the loss of David Fairbairn. Australia is very much the poorer for his passing. </PARA>

I knew Sir David Fairbairn as Mr Fairbairn in the days when I was a young, student Liberal, and he was an active member of the Liberal Party of Australia. He always took a great interest in the younger members of the party, and gave encouragement and support to them. He was always willing to accept invitations to functions and to speak at events. He is a man I remember with affection. I certainly had quite a bit to do with him in earlier times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Sir David's retirement he lived in Canberra and, since his retirement, I have certainly had quite a lot to do with both Sir David and Lady Fairbairn in this community. He maintained an active interest in the Liberal Party and what it was doing, and certainly always helped at any election at which I was a candidate. He was always there to give out how-to-vote cards and to do all the other things that active members of parties do, accompanied of course by Lady Fairbairn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with great interest the obituary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 3 June written by John Farquharson. I would like to quote a little of that because to me it sums up people's thoughts about Sir David Fairbairn. The obituary refers to the time when he made a leadership challenge and, referring to that period, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that everyone was asking at the time was: Why did this quiet gentleman politician make this surprise move? Wal Fife, a colleague who had always been very close to him and who succeeded him in his seat of Farrer, suggested that it came down to the fact that David Fairbairn was a man with a proper sense of duty&mdash;the sort of man who goes into public life purely because he sees it as his duty and for no other reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of his deep concern for the Liberal Party, the Government and the nation, he saw it as his duty to risk all in an attempt to bring about a change which he saw as necessary at the time. But the way he went about it was typical of the man.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quoted as Wal Fife's summary. Mr Fife replaced Sir David as the member for Farrer upon his retirement. I shall continue to see Lady Fairbairn in my electorate. I send my condolences to her and to Sir David's family, and I shall certainly attend the memorial service for him on Thursday of this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we have also heard of a number of his achievements and the things that he was involved in and pursued. I very briefly mention in closing that for a period of time he was also a member of the joint committee on the ACT.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations Statutory Rules 1994 No 57</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide details for the supervision of superannuation funds and trusts that are subject to regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations vest a number of discretions in the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Some of these decisions are subject to reconsideration and AAT review. Also, the parent Act makes some provision for review by the AAT. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether certain other discretions, some of which could affect the operation of funds and the rights of members, are subject to AAT review and, if not, whether the exclusions are within relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council and the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Corporations (Fees) Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1994 No 34</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations introduce lower incorporation fees and annual return fees for superannuation trustees who elect to be regulated as corporate entities for the purpose of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Schedule item 32A confers a discretion on the Australian Securities Commission to decide whether a company is operating solely as a trustee of a regulated superannuation fund. The exercise of this discretion determines the level of incorporation fees and annual return fees for relevant companies. Given that the Explanatory Statement advises that the purpose of the present amendments is to prevent abuse of the fees, the discretion appears to be important. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether this discretion is subject to AAT review and, if not, confirmation that the exclusion is within relevant guidelines for the Administrative Review Council.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New clause 9234 of Schedule 9 inserted by r.21.1 provides that certain persons over 16 years must pass a chest X-ray examination by a radiologist before undertaking more than four weeks study in Australia, unless the person is from a country designated by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notice as a country to which the condition does not apply. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether such an apparently legislative power is legally valid and, if it is, whether relevant notices should be tabled in Parliament and be subject to possible disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, the Regulations provide for the Secretary to defer payment of charges or instalments of charges and, in specified circumstances, to refund or remit charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether these important discretions are subject to AAT review and, if not, for confirmation that the exclusions are within the relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council. The Committee has also asked for advice on the circumstances in which certain discretions will be exercised by a delegate of the Secretary and of the persons to whom delegations will be made.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Orders 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c) provide respectively for the Secretary to declare foreign countries for the purposes of the Orders and to approve a system to indicate that an animal has not been treated with HGP. These powers appear to be legislative. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether this apparent subdelegation is legally valid and, if so, whether these instruments should be subject to tabling and possible disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION COUNCIL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Environment Protection Council Bill is an important landmark in the history of environment protection in Australia. It marks the commitment of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to work cooperatively to develop national environment protection measures. These measures aim to give all Australians the benefit of equivalent environmental protection and to ensure that investment decisions by business are not distorted by variations in environmental standards between Australian jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Establishment of the National Environment Protection Council and development and mandatory application of national environment protection measures is part of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments in May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Intergovernmental Agreement represents an important turning point in Commonwealth/State relations in the environment field in the interests of ecologically sustainable development. The objects of the Agreement bear repeating. It provides a framework to facilitate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a co-operative national approach to the environment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a better definition of the roles of the respective governments;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a reduction in the number of disputes between the Commonwealth, the states and territories on environmental issues;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">greater certainty of Government and business decision making; and importantly</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">better environment protection by integrating environmental considerations into the decision making processes of all governments at the project, program and policy level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Environment Protection Council Bill is the first part of a package of complementary State and Commonwealth legislation to give effect to Schedule 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement. For ease of reference the text of the Intergovernmental Agreement is appended as the Schedule to the bill. The states and territories have agreed to introduce complementary legislation to establish the Council, following which State and Territory, then Commonwealth legislation will be introduced in participating jurisdictions for the mandatory application of national environment protection measures made by the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before the House establishes the National Environment Protection Council, a Ministerial Council drawn from all participating states, territories and the Commonwealth. Although a signatory to the Intergovernmental Agreement, the Western Australian Government has indicated that it will not be participating in the Council at this stage. While this does not invalidate the national scheme, automatic application of national environment protection measures in Western Australia will not be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Local Government Association, as a signatory to the Intergovernmental Agreement, is entitled to observe the deliberations of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council is empowered to make national environmental protection measures which, through complementary implementation legislation, will apply as valid law in each participating jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Environment Protection Council may make measures in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)ambient air quality;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)ambient marine, estuarine, and freshwater quality;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii)noise related to protecting amenity where variations in measures would have an adverse effect on national markets for goods and services;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)general guidelines for the assessment of site contamination;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)the environmental impacts associated with hazardous wastes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vi)motor vehicle emissions; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(vii)the reuse and recycling of used materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Environment Protection measures may be a combination of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)goals or desired essential outcomes to guide management strategies;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)guidelines on means of meeting desired outcomes;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)standards or quantifiable characteristics against which environmental quality is assessed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)protocols or processes for measuring environmental characteristics to determine whether desired outcomes are being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, and to ensure simplicity and effectiveness of administration, Council must develop measures through a public consultative process having regard to a number of factors as specified in the bill. Important among these is the need to have regard to regional environmental differences, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the measure and whether it is the most effective means of achieving the desired environmental outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making a final decision on a measure, Council must have regard to the impact statement relating to the measure; the public submissions received and to advice from a committee of Commonwealth and State officials. Decisions by the Council, which is chaired by the Commonwealth, will be by a two thirds majority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National environment protection measures will be disallowable instruments only in the Commonwealth Parliament as agreed in Schedule 4 of the Agreement. They will apply automatically in each participating jurisdiction after the conclusion of the disallowance period, provided, of course, that there has been no motion of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as making national environmental protection measures the Council has an important role to play in reporting annually to Parliament on its activities, and its overall assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of national environmental protection measures in all participating jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council will be assisted by a statutory committee of Commonwealth and State officials and by a small secretariat staffed by Commonwealth public servants but established as a separate service corporation accountable to the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not proposed to create a substantial new bureaucracy for the development of national environment protection measures. Rather the Council Secretariat will draw upon work being carried out in existing environmental agencies throughout Australia. The cost of establishing NEPC and developing NEPMs will be shared between Commonwealth and state governments on a 50-50 basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the introduction of this bill is an important step in the process of developing harmonious environmental law in Australia to achieve national outcomes. The National Environmental Protection Council provides the means whereby the Commonwealth can work in partnership with the states and the states and territories can work in partnership with each other to share expertise, resources and decision making to benefit environmental protection in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AUTHORITY REPEAL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Repeal of the Automotive Industry Authority Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Automotive Industry Authority was established in 1984 to guide the automotive industry through the substantial changes imposed on it by the introduction of the Car Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of the Car Plan has been on industry restructuring and the promotion of an internationally competitive automotive manufacturing sector. Reviews in 1988 and 1991 have maintained this approach through the continuation of a policy of reduced assistance complemented by various mechanisms to promote rationalisation and increased economies of scale from export production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The automotive industry has responded to this policy with the rationalisation of manufacturing activity and is emerging as an efficient manufacturer and exporter of world class vehicles and components. The Automotive Industry Authority has made a substantial contribution to this development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to maintaining an Australian automotive manufacturing capability. It is cognisant of the strategic value of this capability not only in terms of direct employment and productive capacity in the automotive sector but also as a catalyst for the development of new technologies and new production techniques relevant across Australian manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key issue now is whether the industry is able to continue to improve its competitiveness within the existing policy framework and administrative arrangements under the Car Plan. Many of these factors that affect the industry's competitiveness cut across a number of Commonwealth Portfolios and may require a response at State level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that as a result of the reviews undertaken in 1988 and 1991, the policy and administrative structure itself has become progressively less complex. The direction for automotive policy is to work with the industry to not only monitor its response to existing policy but to also address the basic industry development and business environment issues which impact on its performance. The decision to repeal the Automotive Industry Authority Act reflects these changing demands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, activities relating to automotive policy development and implementation, consideration of strategic issues impacting on the automotive industry, delivery of generic programs to automotive firms and monitoring will be consolidated within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In repealing the legislation, the Government has allocated the equivalent of the Automotive Industry Authority's annual appropriation of $1.1 million to cover the costs of winding down the Authority, meeting financial obligations and relocating staff. Following this initial expenditure, there will be an ongoing saving of $600,000 annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to give effect to changes to operational rules applying to Pooled Development Funds announced as part of a wide range of measures by the Prime Minister on 4 May 1994 in the White Paper on Employment, Industry and Regional Development. The PDF Program, which was introduced in June 1992, is a mechanism for channelling patient equity capital to small and medium sized enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PDFs are concessionally taxed investment companies that may be established under the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 for the purpose of investing in equity in eligible businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program arose out of a recognition that there are imperfections in the capital markets and that small and medium sized firms often have difficulty in obtaining equity capital, especially those that are in the early stages of development. The availability of development capital for such firms is unduly constrained by several factors, with the main ones being a tendency to excessive risk aversion and short-term investment outlook by many suppliers of capital, the lack of a ready market for trading in their equity securities, and some general adverse perceptions about the risk of such investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds, as only $35 million has been raised by PDFs. This is because there is a view that the incentive available under the Program is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment, and because some of the operational rules have been seen as being overly restrictive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Government is committed to ensuring that the Program makes an impact in ameliorating the difficulties faced by small and medium enterprises in accessing capital. It was with this object in mind that the Prime Minister announced the changes to improve the tax incentive under the Program, and the flexibility of the PDF operational rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the revised taxation arrangements the existing  incentives available under the PDF Program have been improved by reducing the concessional tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits PDFs derive from investing in businesses. It should be noted that the tax rate on the profits of a PDF derived from non-SME investments, such as interest earned from securities, will remain at 25 per cent. The Treasurer will be introducing legislation to give effect to this measure. Those amendments will have a financial impact but there is none that will arise as a result of the amendments contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a range of measures to revamp the Program by freeing up the rules under which PDFs operate in line with the experience of the scheme and having regard to the views of the development capital industry. The rules are to be relaxed in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)a PDF will be able to invest in companies with total assets up to $50m, which is an increase of $20m above the existing limit of $30m for investee businesses;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)a PDF will no longer be restricted in its investments in start-up businesses;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)PDFs will be allowed to invest up to 30 per cent of their raised capital in any one investee business. This is an increase from the existing 20 per cent limit;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)the PDF Registration Board will be given a discretionary power to allow PDFs to invest more than the prescribed 30 per cent limit in any one SME investment under conditions agreed by the Board; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)individual ownership in PDFs will be raised from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, except for banks and life offices for whom there is no limit, and the Board's discretionary power to vary this restriction has been retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also increase the percentage of raised capital that a PDF must invest in investee companies from 50 per cent to 65 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The eligibility criteria defined in the PDF Act are essentially unchanged. A company applying for PDF registration must convince the PDF Registration Board that it can and will raise capital and use that capital to purchase new equity in Australian companies in a manner consistent with the various operational rules applying to PDFs. An applicant must provide the PDF Registration Board with investment and capital raising plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements will apply to existing PDFs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new tax rate and PDF operational rules will apply from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators, the Government is aware of the vital contribution to employment, economic growth, and export potential made by the small and medium business sector. The PDF Program is but one element of a range of measures that the Government has introduced to assist this sector. I believe that the Program is an important initiative that will improve the accessibility of small business to capital, and assist in economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRAINING GUARANTEE (SUSPENSION) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the White Paper on Employment and Industry, the Government undertook to suspend the Training Guarantee for two years. The Government believes that employers have recognised the value of training and will continue to play their role in increasing Australia's skills base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to that undertaking while still allowing employers who have not met their obligations in the current year to take advantage of the carry forward provisions which were recently introduced. It also provides employers with some incentive to provide training during the two years of suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those of you who have read the White Paper will be aware that the Government has also undertaken to abolish the Training Guarantee if employers make a credible commitment to providing the training places required in the White Paper strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suspension will be for the two financial years 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995 and 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main effect of the bill is to remove any requirement on employers to pay any training guarantee charge relating to the two years of suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further provision reduces the minimum training rate from the current 1.5 per cent to 0 per cent for the two years of suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second provision will have the effect that employers who elect to postpone a shortfall from the current year (1993/94) will be able to offset the shortfall with any training expenditure they incur in the two years of suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, any excess in those two years may be carried over and set off against a shortfall in 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill 1994 and I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move: On behalf of the leader of the parliamentary delegation, the former Minister for Transport, the Hon. Bob Brown, I present the report on the delegation's visit to Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Morocco. Other members of the delegation were the deputy leader, the Hon. John Moore, Senator Baden Teague, Mr Daryl Melham, Mr Bruce Scott, myself, and the secretary, Mr Peter Stephens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco from 9 November to 3 December 1993, a period which history will show was a vital stage in the ongoing process of achieving peace in the Middle East. The delegation was warmly welcomed by dignitaries and a number of leaders from the countries we visited. Standing out as the main highlight of these discussions was a 1 1/2-hour meeting with the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat. We were the first Australian parliamentary delegation to have the privilege of meeting Chairman Arafat. The fortunate timing of the visit, and especially the discussion with Chairman Arafat, gave the delegation a unique opportunity to observe at close quarters the peace process in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibilities for future commercial and cultural links between Australia and the region we visited were also uppermost in the minds of the delegation. There is tremendous goodwill in the region towards Australia flowing on from our commitment to the region during the two world wars and, since then, our support for and sympathy with the resolutions of the UN Security Council. The delegation took all opportunities to emphasis that Australia was determined to support measures which would contribute to a just, lasting and honourable peace in the region. At all of the discussions we stressed the Australian government's policy of total commitment to Israel's right to exist and the recognition of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Future commercial links with the four countries were also explored whenever opportunities presented themselves. The various discussions with commercial and agricultural representatives are reported on in detail in the report, and I recommend them to honourable senators. In brief, the prospects for increasing Australia's trade in these countries seem more than favourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the many high points for the delegation was the visit to Morocco&mdash;the first by an Australian parliamentary delegation. We were also the first parliamentary delegation from any country to be hosted by the Moroccan House of Representatives after the 1993 general elections. Australia's constitutional and electoral procedures were much discussed at talks with members of the various parties and political groupings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many points have been raised in the report on mutually beneficial cooperation between Australia and the four countries visited. This cooperation and discussion form the basis of the delegation's short list of recommendations which are outlined in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the delegates, including me, were accompanied by our spouses. Their commitment to the purpose of the delegation and their positive input was much appreciated. All members of the delegation benefited greatly from the outstanding contribution to the delegation's success made by the secretary to the delegation, Mr Peter Stephens. In particular, I mention also the support given by Paul Robilliard, the ambassador to Syria and Lebanon, and John Sheppard, the ambassador to Jordan and Tunisia. A number of other people who supported the delegation are mentioned in the report. Their personal assistance and knowledge of the region was much appreciated by members of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation has gained valuable insight into the problems and opportunities faced by the countries we visited. The challenging program and the diversity of issues covered, and the people we met, provided an excellent opportunity for fact finding, gathering and promotion of goodwill between Australia and the countries visited. I commend the report to the Senate and move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As another senator who was a member of the parliamentary delegation which visited Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco from 9 November to 3 December last year, I wish to speak very briefly, before seeking leave to continue my remarks, about this significant report to the parliament. Senator Jones, who has just spoken, and I were the two senators who made up the delegation along with four members of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with every part of the observations made by Senator Jones about the report that he has presented to the Senate. I found it a most satisfactory delegation to be a part of. Colleagues in the Senate will know that Senator Jones and I have been fortunate to be asked to represent the parliament on a number of delegations over the years. This particular delegation had excellent group dynamics; it had an excellent commitment to Australia's interests, and to the explicit objectives of the visits to the Middle East that are set out in the beginning of the report. I believe it had a significant impact on those four countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ambassadors of Australia in the region said to us in one of the careful, well-prepared formal farewells that we had, that the delegation had achieved for Australia more in a few days than is possible by the diplomatic service in a few years. I took that as a very important compliment. I believe that when a well-prepared and well-briefed group of members of parliament, in a delegation such as this one, proceed with energy and with carefulness, it is possible to build bridges, to start waves, to lift flags, and to open opportunities that can have a very significant impact. The parliament should never underestimate the good that can come for Australia when we work together with our permanent representatives&mdash;our ambassadors and public servants&mdash;in the way that we were able to at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was right that we went to Syria. As far as I know, this was one of the first parliamentary delegations to Syria. For 20 or 30 years, Syria has been offside with most countries because of its militant support of terrorism and its irresponsible international policies. However, this has been changing in recent years, particularly since the Gulf War when Syria was an ally with us, the United States and most other countries in action against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Also, as Syria has been making positive moves towards discussions with Israel for a settlement of the Middle East conflicts, it was right to go and listen to the Syrian parliament, to the government and to other elements of Syria, business included, and to make sure that an Australian-Syrian dialogue was open at a number of levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Lebanon, the civil war is definitely over. There are some terrorists and militant elements still within the country, such as Hezbollah, and they have some outside support. There are various analyses that we have not got time to give with regard to that. Only this week, Israel took direct military against Hezbollah. We do not welcome the need for military action on anyone's part in this part of the world. We are looking to a concluded peace between Lebanon and Israel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The civil war is over, and the flavour of all the discussion in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon was to reconstruct the country and to involve Australians in that construction process, in investment and in trade. We talked about the live sheep trade, building, and the injection of highly skilled elements of expertise that are needed by Lebanon and, to some extent, by Syria. Australia can make a positive contribution in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Maghreb, the other countries in the north of Africa, I believe again that this was one of the first parliamentary delegations to visit the area. We were able to visit only two of the Mahgreb countries, Tunisia and Morocco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make invidious comparisons but I commend Tunisia&mdash;its government, its parliament and its foreign minister&mdash;for the enlightenment that it brought to the UN agenda, to African nation discussions, to Middle East discussions, to human rights matters generally and to human rights for women in particular. As a Muslim country, and as a member of the Association of Islamic Countries, Tunisia has a very important voice that needs to be heard in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same goes for Morocco. Whilst there has been some difficulty between the King of Morocco and the elected members of the parliament&mdash;it may have been possible for the King to invite a prime minister and other major ministers from what was, up until last year, the opposition because of its success in the recent election&mdash;what happens in Morocco as regards government and the parliamentary election outcome is a matter of judgment. We found an excellent welcome in Tunisia and Morocco, as members of parliament and as Australians. There are some niche markets, not least in wool and iron ore, for Australia in the Mahgreb group of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to Tunisia's role in being the host for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. It was a very stable base for the PLO to diplomatically conclude its accord with Israel last September, an accord for which we all have very high hopes. The initiatives of the foreign ministry and government of Tunisia&mdash;in Norway, in the UN and in bilateral discussions with the other Middle East players&mdash;has been most significant in the coming together of Chairman Arafat and the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and other representatives of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of careful knowledge that the government and opposition in this chamber wish the accord between Israel and the PLO&mdash;indeed, between Israel and all the Palestinian people&mdash;well. We look forward to step-by-step progress through the five-year period outlined in the report. We can see the real achievements in Jericho and Gaza and we can see the enormous difficulties but we also see the determination on both sides for progress to be made. It is only right that Australia stands ready to assist as an international player in making that process of reconciliation, of working together, of peace, more achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happened to have been the first official meeting between any Australians and Chairman Arafat, and we had the honour of doing it in his own working office in Tunis. For an hour and a half, Ambassador Sheppard, the ambassador to Tunisia from Australia, the leader of our parliamentary delegation Mr Bob Brown, the deputy leader Mr John Moore, Mr Bruce Scott, Senator Jones and I&mdash;the final member of the delegation, Mr Melham, was absent on that particular occasion but joined us again in Morocco&mdash;were delighted to have a constructive, bona fide discussion not only with Chairman Arafat but also with the PLO's foreign spokesman Qaddoumi, with whom we met separately and together with Chairman Arafat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very conscious of debates in this chamber over the need for security for the Israeli and Palestinian people and for a solution to be determined by the representatives of those peoples on a just basis. By our parliamentary delegation visit to these four middle eastern and north African countries we are now better placed in this parliament to respond positively to those things that Australia can do to help in that peace process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I noticed was a continuation of the good work that AIDAB is doing in the Asian area. It is very much targeting particular projects and seeking the advice and views of the people for whom the projects are being undertaken. We attended a public meeting in a certain area where there was a project that provided water and sewerage. The people at that meeting indicated their pleasure at being consulted about and involved in the construction of the project. I believe that our role in the Philippines and the development of our friendship is continuing apace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the AIPO conference, even though we were only observers, we played an important role. We listened very intently to what was said by those nations which are part of the AIPO organisation. We had discussions with representatives of all those nations, known as a dialogue. It was agreed that we would recommend to the Australian government that it pursue agreements with the governments of the ASEAN countries for: the protection of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of such agreements; the development of tourism links in the region, including better air links; and the promotion of preventative health measures, including a common approach by the nations of the region in dealing with AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of that dialogue which I regarded as very important and very comforting was the discussion about a dispute over the potential of petroleum products in the Spratly Island area of the South China Sea.

It became fairly obvious that it was necessary to expand our friendly ties with that country and we certainly proceeded to do that. We saw that there was an opportunity to develop trade, particularly in the area of food. We must take into account their requirements for the way in which animals are killed in our abattoirs so that the meat is acceptable to their religious beliefs. </PARA>

<PARA>I refer to the Auditor-General's report No. 38 on the rural research and development program of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy particularly with regard to research, innovation and competitiveness in the rural sector. I would like to make a number of observations. I thank the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction for the opportunity to come back and speak to this report. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that. One has to realise that it takes a while to get through this report. Research into rural industry undertaken by the department is almost unique in the world in that it basically works on a year in year out basis and on a dollar for dollar basis. In the 1993-94 budget the government contribution was $97 million and the industry contribution was $90 million. If we leave out the contribution by government to newer industries which are now getting on their feet, the longstanding more fundamental industries provide dollar for dollar funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theme coming through from this report and from the task force is for a reduction in the dollar for dollar funding, and I urge the government not to consider that course because it would be a tragedy. If we look at the summary of the report we see `investment returns achieved.' I will read this particular part because I think it is very, very important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Authoritative studies of a number of rural industries over an extended period reported rates of return from 18% to over 100%. Benefit-to-cost ratios achieved were positive and, in some cases, very high.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to emphasise that in looking at the arrangements that now exist, the results are outstanding and have been outstanding for some time. Any interference with the system in place at the present time would be a step backwards, particularly when we recognise that there was a review in 1989. I disagree very strongly with one particular part of the report, and that is the reduced need for incentive. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, there appears scope for more reliance on normal commercial incentives and reduced emphasis on financial incentives through the Commonwealth Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the reasons why I believe that rural research has been so successful is the incentives that have been provided for many years. The program of incentives is nothing new. That particular part of the report needs to be thought through very, very carefully because we could well end up with a situation where those incentives are taken away. If that occurs the results could well drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to raise concerns the split-up between the community good and what is loosely termed the industry good or the industry benefit. It says here quite categorically:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . less than 20% of their programs were concerned with basic and `public good' research that did not have direct industry application.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the report is saying that 80 per cent is of direct industry benefit. Good research and good research results, and the application of those results&mdash;even though they go back directly to the industry&mdash;have a very important community or public good spin-off. Whether it is in the wool industry, the meat industry, packaging in the meat industry, or the grain industry, the more competitive those industries stay and the more they stay in front of international competitors, the better off all Australians will be. This break-up highlights that the research is well targeted. I believe that the break-up is appropriate. I emphasise that it is more than just the 20 per cent that goes to the good of the community in the broader context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at other industries we see such things as best practice programs and other programs to which rural industries do not have access and cannot utilise. In my view it is not satisfactory to just brush those few matters off in such a way and use that as a justification&mdash;as this report appears to be doing&mdash;for a reduction in the incentives that currently exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point comes under the heading `ANAO found limited evaluation by DPIE'. I will read this particular point because I think it is very important, and I believe that it does not truly reflect the overall evaluations because DPIE is not the only body that does the evaluations. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the audit the Department had conducted one consultant study which concentrated on the operation of the R&amp;D corporation's model. Further evaluation had been planned, including progress towards achieving the aims and objectives of the program. However, the extent of the work proposed was not clear and it had been deferred.</PARA>
<PARA>I challenge that particular aspect in the broader context because the various corporations which are responsible for the evaluation and the running of these particular programs put a very high emphasis on the importance of the evaluation. In the end, the best evaluation is whether or not industry picks up the research and utilises it. The very clear evidence is that industry does pick up the research evaluation. It raises another question, which is the subject of another debate, because it varies from state to state. Certainly in my state the Department of Agriculture has a very high reputation&mdash;in fact the highest in Australia&mdash;in terms of its extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular aspect of the report is also picked up under Appendix 2, entitled `Extract from the Report of the Task Force on Review of Rural Research'. I am pleased that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has come in because I would urge him to look very carefully before there was any move to interfere with the role of the various R&amp;D corporations. In my view, their membership is balanced. There is a balance of practical people in the industry, scientists and people who understand the economic importance of getting good results out of research. I would also take issue with the theme that is contained in that particular recommendation. The last point that I wish to refer to in terms of this report is recommendation 5, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.no additional Councils should be formed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.DPIE and, as appropriate, the Minister initiate discussions with the relevant industries with a view to exploring alternative options to the current Council arrangements, while maintaining the current level of industry involvement and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the minister treat this recommendation very carefully. I think the advent of the various corporations for rural research and development have been very successful and have done a very good job. I must take issue with that particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I would make in terms of that recommendation, which I think is short-sighted, is that no additional council should be formed. At this time I believe that basically the various industries are covered, but I think we will see the day not too far down the track, with the development of horticulture in particular, when there could well be a need to have specialised corporations with certain aspects of horticulture, just the same as there are for grains, meat and wool. Once again, I make the point that I think this recommendation is short-sighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to wind up my comments by referring to Senator Cook's answer in question time today with regard to the terms of accessibility to CSIRO being with an independent note taker from the minister's office. I think that is one of the most ludicrous suggestions that I have ever heard put in this parliament. I hope that the minister has cooled down, has thought about what he said at that time and will do what is necessary to remove this interference with the overall accessibility to CSIRO and the possible extension into other government departments. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise with very real concern about the declaration under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, made on 12 May with regard to the area of Goolwa in my state of South Australia and Hindmarsh Island, where the River Murray has a significant bend or elbow. The Aboriginal word for elbow is `Goolwa'; hence the name of the town that is based there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration by Mr Tickner stands for some 30 days. This tabled paper in front of me says, `This Declaration will cease to have effect on 14 June 1994'; that is, in about a week's time. In this period of 30 days, the effect of the declaration by the Commonwealth minister for aboriginal affairs has been to stop the building of a bridge between Goolwa town and Hindmarsh Island at the point fully investigated and planned by the state government of South Australia and, in fact, very close to where the current ferry operates and has been operating for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the declaration of the Commonwealth minister are not in any way set out in the tabled declaration. Rather, it is a bold legal statement that is published in the Commonwealth of Australia <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. This is the kind of blank cheque that the parliament has given to any Aboriginal affairs minister to act in matters where he is concerned that Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage needs urgent protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that those of us with a direct concern in this matter have not had any even informal disclosure by the minister of what the reasons for his action have been. The only publicly available reasons appear to me&mdash;and I have been following this for many months, indeed, for several years&mdash;to be the location of an Aboriginal midden at about the point where the bridge footings are to be constructed. This is one of 6,000 midden, as I understand it, in that region. Another reason is that this point, which is a national crossing point between the land and the island, was perhaps a place of Aboriginal congregation where Aboriginal people met in some decades last century, but that has not been the case at any point in this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further concerned, because in the development of plans for the bridge, the state government is required to make an environmental impact statement which must look at not only environmental matters but also Aboriginal heritage matters. There was a green light given in the early investigations of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for there being a bridge include, firstly, that there is a large marina development of very real significance to the state of South Australia and, indeed, to recreation use of the river and the whole southern region about the Murray mouth, Lake Alexandrina and other important and valuable areas of the state. This highly professionally planned marina required a volume of traffic between the marina and the mainland&mdash;the marina is built on the island&mdash;which led some years ago to most careful discussions with the state government of South Australia for approval for a bridge to be built, partly at the expense of the state of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A firm contract of agreement was determined by the former Labor government led by Premier Bannon and, as I understand it, in particular determined by the then Minister for Tourism, Minister Wiese. This contract or firm undertaking entered into by the previous Labor government was carefully examined by the incoming Liberal government, following the last state election and Premier Dean Brown; the Minister for Transport, the Hon. Di Laidlaw; the minister for the environment, the Hon. David Wotton; and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Dr Michael Armitage, were all involved, as were all members of the government of South Australia, to see what obligations remained upon the South Australian government with regard to the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help them in their investigations, they asked a former Supreme Court justice, Sam Jacobs, to carry out a thorough investigation of the whole matter. He had access to all papers related to the contract for the development of the bridge, all the environmental impact statements, community consultations, engineering plans, cost estimates and everything to do with the bridge. Justice Sam Jacobs has a very high reputation in South Australia as an honest broker and a very competent man. He was the one who was asked by the former Labor government to carry out the royal commission into the State Bank of South Australia. His report is well known in this parliament, as well as in South Australia. That was the principal matter at issue at the last state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has criticised the abilities or the bona fides of Justice Jacobs in carrying out his work. It was this same Justice Jacobs who was asked by the Dean Brown Liberal government to investigate the arrangements with regard to the Goolwa-Hindmarsh Island bridge. His conclusion was unequivocal&mdash;that there is a contract existing for the state government of South Australia to complete the bridge and, moreover, to complete it as soon as practicable. Accordingly, the state government of South Australia, the Minister for Transport and other ministers let contracts for the building of the bridge. The footings were begun earlier this year and the bridge was about to be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this point, after many years of the process being determined, that two different groups emerged with a last minute&mdash;more than 11th hour&mdash;attempt to veto the bridge. One involved those with broad, but not fully specified, environmental concerns&mdash;environmental concerns that everybody shares in this area because of the bird life, the salinity of the river, the preciousness of the habitat on Hindmarsh Island and so on. No-one has a monopoly on concern about the important environmental heritage that is wrapped up in the island and in this lower end of the River Murray system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of this 11th hour intervention came from some individual Aboriginal persons who claimed to speak on behalf of Aborigines of the area or their descendants or, perhaps, to have some claim to be representative of the Aboriginal people in that area. It is very difficult in this part of Australia where there has not been continuous occupation of land by Aboriginal people and their descendants for the representativeness of such spokesmen to be evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these last minute attempts to intervene, the state government again re-examined the matter and Ministers Armitage and Laidlaw, and Premier Brown, went ahead with the building of the bridge. The very last veto that then was attempted was the one we have tabled before us today by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, acting under section 9 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to be a South Australian senator who supports the just claims for land of Aboriginal people. I was present when my good friend Premier Tonkin handed over the title for the Pitjantjatjara land to the Pitjantjatjara community in a creek bed north of Ernabella. This was some 12 years ago. For five years I have been a member of the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Senator Collins, who is in the chamber, would note that I support the land claim made by the people at Daguragu and Kalkarindji near Wave Hill, which has led to the Gurindji people having land of their own possession in perpetuity. I am conscious of the land claims for which there has been solid evidence&mdash;and I have supported such claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also on the record in the Mabo debate as saying that the High Court decision in the Mabo case was justified, and I believe it still. If I had been on the High Court of Australia, I would have put up my hand to give a title of land to the Torres Strait Islanders on Murray Island in the way it was given in the Mabo case. For the credibility of my evaluations of Aboriginal land claims and for the credibility of Aboriginal people themselves in making such claims, I am therefore speaking out here in the Senate to ask the minister, `What is the credible set of facts that would lead to any significant Aboriginal heritage being endangered in this bridge matter in my state of South Australia?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has made it clear to me that there is anything of Aboriginal heritage apart from one in 6,000 middens or a generalised place of Aboriginal congregation in the last century. There is no Aboriginal sacred site to my knowledge&mdash;that anyone has told me about&mdash;that has anything to do with the bridge. This was the finding of the environmental impact statement that was carried out not only by the developers of the marina but also by the state government of South Australia. I refer to Roger Lubers, consultant archaeologist of Adelaide, and Neil Draper, the senior archaeologist of the Aboriginal heritage branch at that time, who were consulted with regard to this land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must draw my remarks to a close. I am very familiar with this part of South Australia. All my life I have known Goolwa very well. I know Hindmarsh Island; I have been there scores of times. I happen to be an environmentalist who appreciates the area. I sail beyond the first barrage, past the Murray mouth and down into the Coorong where, with my family and friends, I am delighted to leave undisturbed what is for me one of the precious parts of the heritage of South Australia. But I am of the view that unless there is a marina, unless there is a road, a hotel or a shop that can provide for people visiting that area in a responsible fashion, we will not be opening up the possibility of not only international and interstate visitors, but also South Australian people being able to see for themselves this marvellous part of South Australia's heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were so conservative as to put a wall around every area of national park so that no-one could get into it, we would be defeating the purpose of a national park. I am most vigilant to ensure that anyone who uses the national park, the Coorong, in South Australia does so in the most responsible and careful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the area well. I have ridden on the ferry between the island and Goolwa scores of times. If I were scratched a little bit I, along with some of my family members, would put my hand up and, as a strictly personal view, say that I actually quite like the quaint ferry that delays us 20 minutes&mdash;or, in a busy time, 40 minutes&mdash;in getting across to the island. In our busy life it is something which slows us down and leads us to get acclimatised to the island, the boat, the sailing and the walking that we are about to embark on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the view of the people of Goolwa; it is not the view of the state government of South Australia; it is not the view of the developer of the marina; and I believe it is not the view of the majority of the people on Hindmarsh Island. There is a clear minority view among some residents on the island, some `environmentalists' and some `Aboriginal spokesmen' against the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by urging Minister Tickner to tell me the reasons, even if it is on a private basis, so that I can be satisfied as one senator. But more than me, the interested parties in South Australia should be told the reasons. What is the Aboriginal heritage that is at risk in this matter which has escaped five years or more of investigation?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is no disclosure and if this declaration is continued beyond 14 June for any reason, we will have a conclusion that can rightly be reached. We would say that this was the most intrusive power of any government or any minister to upset a development that may be to the benefit of thousands of Australians&mdash;a project that has involved many millions of dollars of work&mdash;without reasons being given to all of the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This coming Friday there happens to be a mass rally in Goolwa by its residents. I understand that this rally is being organised by the mayor of the town, without reference to the developer of the marina on the island. It is to call for the building of the bridge. The majority of those who have contacted me want to see that bridge built for public reasons. The state government wants to see it built because it is under a legal obligation to build it. The developers of the marina want it built because they are the ones who have urged that there be that regular access without the 20 minute delay at the ferry. I want to know from Minister Tickner&mdash;a person with whom I have had some bona fide and genuine meetings over many years&mdash;the reasons, so that they can be communicated to that rally of South Australians on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Campbell wishes to speak because he sees parallels with what has happened to a crocodile farm development in Broome in Western Australia, because of the action of the minister in a declaration of this kind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to correct a number of things which Senator Teague has just harangued the Senate about in connection with the Hindmarsh Island bridge. I suppose one could summarise his 20- to 25-minute speech by saying that financial considerations of developers should always take precedence over the environment and Aboriginal concerns. That is really a summary of what Senator Teague said because he has tried to imply that those people who are concerned about the environment and those people who are concerned about Aboriginal heritage in South Australia have come very lately to this battle. So let me take Senator Teague back through a little history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 a developer not unlike the Chapmans chose to go into the last remaining wetland on the lower part of the upper Murray. He cleared that wetland by burning it off and getting backhoes into it before getting any permission whatsoever, and he totally destroyed a very important area. I then went along to see the then South Australian state minister for environment, Dr Don Hopgood. I am taking Senator Teague back to 1984; I am not talking 1994. I pointed out to Don Hopgood, the then environment minister, that already we were having serious problems with pollution of the Murray, that there was a limit on the number of marinas that could be built on the Murray and that, although the houseboats that often go into the marinas discharge their sewage ashore&mdash;albeit just on to the bank where it goes through a septic tank-type system&mdash;and the nutrient runs back into the river and adds to the nutrient in the river, things like the shower water and the washing-up water with potatoes peels, detergents and all those sorts of things go from the houseboats into the river. There was a serious problem with these sorts of things going into the river, and there was a limit to how many marinas could be put on the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hopgood, the South Australian minister for environment in 1984, assured me that that was the last marina that would ever be built on the Murray in South Australia. I want to put that on the record. Of course, Don Hopgood did not remain the minister for environment. He retired. The Bannon government, as we now know, went ahead and gave permission for a marina on the lower part of the Murray on the Hindmarsh Island side, increasing the impact on that Murray River system. Many people concerned about the environment have complained long and hard about the environmental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say of Mr Chapman that it was not part of his original proposal to build a bridge. In fact, that was foisted on him by the then Labor government. The Bannon government wrote that into the agreement. One must ask serious questions as to why, in the dying stages of a Labor government which had run up $10 billion worth of debts in the state, the minister for tourism in that Labor government chose to write that requirement into an agreement which was not necessary. I think it raises very serious questions about the propriety of that Labor government and whether there were not other reasons why that was entered into. Nonetheless, that was entered into. From then on there has been steady and very considerable opposition to the building of this bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague seemed to be arguing that all we were talking about was the impact of the bridge on the actual footings where the bridge was being built. He totally ignored the fact that, as the population pressure on Hindmarsh Island is increased and as people are given access to the far end of Hindmarsh Island, the pressure on that whole very important area down the Coorong, Younghusband Peninsula, Sir Richard Peninsula and so on is increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things Senator Teague seems to be ignoring is that fragile environments can take only so much population pressure before they start to break down. We cannot simply go on increasing the population pressure on these environments, expecting everybody to have the same enjoyment that Senator Teague spoke about so eloquently. It simply will not happen. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My judgment is that that area is sufficiently fragile, it is already under considerable pressure and it simply cannot take that increased population pressure. Those are my remarks to do with just the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people in that area were abused by the settlers of South Australia from the very earliest days. I think Senator Teague would have read in his history books how poisoned flour was issued to the Aboriginal people on the Younghusband Peninsula area in an attempt to exterminate them. The area was a rich area&mdash;one very rich in Aboriginal heritage, and it remained so. It was very sacred, particularly to the Aboriginal women. The whole area is of great importance to them. So it is not simply the disturbance to the area where the footings of the bridge will go; it is the whole issue of having thousands and thousands of people going on to Hindmarsh Island, subdividing the area, inevitably going through the 6,000 Aboriginal middens&mdash;there is probably more than that&mdash;and burial sites that Senator Teague mentioned and simply despoiling the area by that intense human habitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Minister Tickner has quite rightly exercised his powers under this act. I hope that the report for which he has called and which he is required to examine before he gives a final declaration will find that this bridge should not be built and that it would indeed interfere excessively with that very important Aboriginal heritage site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite contrary to Senator Teague's claim that the environmental people and the Aboriginal people are Johnnies-come-lately in this battle, this battle has been going on for a long time. If the state Labor government, as it was then, had been true to its promise to me in 1984, permission would never have been given in the first place for that marina on Hindmarsh Island. I understand the marina, before Minister Tickner's decision to call for this report was made, was actually in receivership, so it is extremely doubtful whether there is a great deal of economic benefit in this for either the developer or the people of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons I conclude by saying that I think the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was right in seeking to go down this path. I hope that the report that the minister has called for will confirm that this action should be turned from a temporary stay of execution into a permanent stay of execution and that the area should be protected more firmly, both as a conservation area and as an area of very great Aboriginal significance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that, some nearly 20 years later, I am able to visit Goolwa on Friday if I can possibly make it there to the public meeting. This is a very important issue that has been raised here. Taking away the local dispute between the people who are fighting about the environment and the people who are fighting about the Aboriginal heritage aspects to it, the real issue of principle, particularly here in the Senate, is the power of this federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to issue this declaration and the secrecy surrounding a lot of it that Senator Teague has already raised.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to look at here in the short contribution I make is the dangerous parallel with section 40 subsections (2) to (4) of the Native Title Act, where again the minister has a very similar power to overrule state tribunals and also the National Native Title Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Labor government in Australia we are getting to the stage where, if we want to build a thunderbox in the backyard, it is actually more sensible to write to the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs first. In the last few months this minister has issued declarations under section 9 on no less than four occasions. On 12 May he issued the declaration we are debating this afternoon, the one to stop the construction of a multimillion dollar bridge. On 31 March he issued a declaration regarding Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us from Western Australia know very well about the declaration to stop digging to build some ponds for crocodiles to live in up on Malcolm Douglas's crocodile farm at Broome. The minister issued no less than two declarations there. With the first 30-day application nothing happened, but Malcolm Douglas's operations virtually disintegrated. He then issued another 30-day declaration and finally appointed our former colleague Fred Chaney to mediate. Fred Chaney brought down a private report to the minister&mdash;we have yet to see that report&mdash;telling the minister that it should not go ahead. The minister then issued a declaration for five years&mdash;not a permanent declaration, a declaration for five years to stop development going ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Mr Douglas has 40 acres or thereabouts up in Broome with a declaration imposed by a federal minister sitting here in Canberra. I am not sure whether the minister has even been to Broome. Malcolm Douglas is sitting there on the land but he cannot dig it up, he cannot chop down a tree or do anything on the land. I am sure he still has to pay the local rates and taxes; I am sure he has to pay everything else. I am sure he has received no compensation from the federal government following this order from the federal minister supported by the one-man Chaney tribunal that takes evidence in secret, that does not keep transcripts&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot tell Senator Coulter whether Mr Chaney is wrong or not. I have not seen the report; I do not know to whom he spoke; it is all a secret. I have to trust the minister of the Crown who made this declaration. But I can tell Senator Coulter what is wrong: it is wrong that there is a minister sitting here in Canberra telling a bloke in Western Australia&mdash;or in South Australia or Boobera Lake or up on the Todd River in Senator Collins's electorate&mdash;that he cannot do something. It is a one-man tribunal. The decision can be appealed, but it is a one-man tribunal. As I said, if we want to build a thunderbox in the backyard in Australia, it is now better to come to Canberra and put the application to Mr Tickner first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person should get approval from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs first and then go to his local council and then the state government. A person should not go through all the normal proposals; he should not get an environmental assessment done; and he should not go to the Aboriginal heritage systems in whichever state he is operating. It is when he moves in with his bulldozers that Mr Tickner turns up. It does not matter whether it is at Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales, whether one wants to build a dam on the Todd River, whether one wants to build a bridge down at Goolwa or whether one wants to build a crocodile farm up at Broome: as soon as the bulldozer turns up Mr Tickner will be there a couple of minutes later. After the finance is in place, after the work force is in place, after all the state and local approvals are in place, Mr Tickner turns up. That is the principle that stinks about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other principle that is very wrong about having a bloke sitting here in Canberra deciding what people will do with their land in the states is the very dangerous parallel we have with the Native Title Act which passed through this chamber back in December last year. Last Friday we heard&mdash;and I see the chairman of the joint native title committee, my colleague Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia in the chamber today&mdash;that for approvals that are required to go through the National Native Title Tribunal the process can take between one and two years, and sometimes longer. It was not disputed by any of the people who gave evidence last Friday at the private hearings of the joint native title committee of this parliament that it can sometimes take two to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been through that process, having spent who knows how much money getting approvals firstly through the local authority, the state government and then through the National Native Title Tribunal, and any courts one may have to go through in the process, section 42 of the Native Title Act then says that the federal minister can overrule the tribunal. So it can take two or three years of approvals&mdash;all the approvals one has to get, all the approvals Malcolm Douglas up in Broome had to get, all the approvals for the bridge at Goolwa, all the approvals in the other two instances where Mr Tickner engaged himself&mdash;but under the Native Title Act the minister can do the same thing, and he has absolute discretion to do so within two months of the tribunal making a ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of all the decisions that have been made and regardless of the setting up of the tribunal, in the end one man or woman, whoever it happens to be&mdash;actually, Gary Johns is the minister responsible for this act&mdash;can overrule the National Native Title Tribunal's decision to ensure that that development goes ahead. If the people who are parties to the decision of the National Native Title Tribunal are not happy with the outcome&mdash;if it is a developer who happens to be a mate of the Labor Party when the tribunal has ruled in favour of the Aboriginal people in question&mdash;the developer who is a mate of the Labor Party can go to Gary Johns and say, `Johnsy, mate, we looked after you in the last election; can you look after us with this decision.' The minister has the power to overrule the National Native Title Tribunal's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, if an Aboriginal land council or group of Aboriginal activists, party to a decision before the tribunal, goes to the minister after two or three years of the approval process having been followed through, and if that group has the ear of the minister, then that group can get the minister to overturn the decision. Why would people even bother entering the approvals process? Why bother coming up with an idea to develop a piece of Australia if all those convoluted, confusing, expensive, unworkable processes can be gone through but, at the very end of it, it is still in the hands of the federal minister who, in the case of Western Australians, lives 3,000 miles away? In the case of Broome, it is more like 4,000 miles away. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend and colleague Senator Crane says, the minister does not have a clue. As Senator Teague and Senator Coulter said, there are some very genuine concerns that all Australians share with regard to protecting Aboriginal heritage. But the reality is that Aboriginal people lived, worshipped and went through all their activities across the whole of Australia. If some of the anti-development Aboriginal activists had their way, nowhere would there be development in Australia. Aborigines, like most of the Australian population, generally lived on the coast because they had access to fresh water, higher rainfall and better vegetation. A hell of a lot of the Aboriginal population lived in coastal regions. They were not silly: just like most Australians they lived on the coast where it is cooler and there are better living conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs, as I have&mdash;I am the secretary of the coalition's Aboriginal affairs backbench committee&mdash;understand that if one wants to stop development anywhere on the coast it is not hard to find where Aborigines lived. There is a difference between places where Aborigines had living sites, burial sites and places of worship, and it is absolutely crucial that there be a sensible balance between the preservation of Aboriginal heritage, the preservation of environmental values on our coast and the development of our coast. If we are to say that we cannot build a hut, bridge, resort of marina wherever an Aborigine lived at any time in the last 2,000 years, then we will not develop the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to suspect that some people who go off to Mr Tickner every time a bulldozer turns up on the coast and say, `Issue me a section 9 declaration,' really have as their motivation the stopping of all development on the coast of Australia. If that is their motivation, they should stand up and say so. There is evidence of Aboriginal living sites, burial sites and sacred sites right around the coast of Australia&mdash;from Cape York, right around the bottom, around Cape Leeuwin, right up the other side to Broome and right across the north. Aborigines have enjoyed living on the coast for thousands of years, and we should respect that. But when we are considering the development of the Australian coast, we have to strike a balance between respect for their heritage, respect for their former living and burial sites and the development of the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I have to say that if we continue to pass laws through this parliament such as the Aboriginal heritage act that gives one man the power to stop development in the way that this minister has done on four occasions over the last couple of months&mdash;and that is now enshrined in section 42 of the Native Title Act which gives power to the Special Minister of State to do exactly the same thing under the Native Title Act&mdash;not only will this nation come to a grinding halt as far as development goes, but we will also create an enormous amount of racial tension between Aboriginal Australians and Australians of European descent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get resentment building up because we have a government here in Canberra using so-called Aboriginal heritage to stop development and stop jobs around Australia, we will create racial tension in Australia, which nobody wants. There will be radicals on both sides of the political spectrum who will operate to try to create that tension for their own vested political points of view. That is something that none of us wants to see in Australia, and that is the road down which this government is taking us with these sorts of interventions and with its Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very dangerous course that this government has embarked upon. Not only will it halt development, not only will it create a disintegration of the Australian Federation, but it will also divide Australia on racial grounds. That is something which should be resisted and is something which the minister should think very carefully about before he issues more of these declarations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been rightly acknowledged that I have come fairly recently to this issue. My reason for involvement came towards the end of last year when people who were very concerned about what was happening in relation to the Hindmarsh Island bridge development heard about the, at that stage, potentially successful intervention over a Ramsar protected area in Western Australia; that is, the Creery Wetlands. I received a delegation of people who showed me maps and pictures of the area and explained their concerns regarding the impact of development in terms of not only the activity of migratory birds but the essential significance of the area to Aboriginal people. They expressed those views and they requested my urgent intervention on and support for the issue. I believe they had also gained support from Senator Coulter and others who were aware of their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the history of this project is worth evaluating. It does seem to me that some points have been missed in discussing it. I want to add my words to those of Senator Coulter in saying that from the start the impact of development on this area seems not to have been looked at sufficiently seriously both from an environmental and from an Aboriginal heritage point of view.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the planning process actually involved getting the proponents of a private development on Hindmarsh Island to agree to provide public infrastructure at their expense&mdash;a bridge&mdash;in order to obtain planning approval for their development. This had not been their original intention. Indeed, contained in their EIS for the project was expert traffic consultant advice that a bridge was not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a later document an EIS for a bridge was promised. This was never required or provided by the planning process. At that stage the development was a fairly simple one which might have required an additional ferry. I want to put on the record that none of the protesters from the community, who are deeply concerned about the bridge development, are unwilling to negotiate in relation to developments that are sensitive to the ecotourism concerns and the Aboriginal concerns regarding that highly significant area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having originally desired from the proponents of the development the commitment to a bridge, the council and the government then put forward that proposal for a bridge, but at public expense. A situation has emerged in which the present government, which some feel is seeking to hedge the risk of litigation, is actually driving innocent, honest citizens to bear the brunt of, basically, intimidatory tactics. Conservationists were arrested and held over under secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act on the day before that act was changed. It has led to people who believe very strongly in the proper pursuit of the developmental process coming under severe threat and intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having become involved in this issue, I visited the area. There was a gathering of about 200 people from all different sections of the local community who were desperately concerned that the development should not go ahead. As I mentioned previously, six arrests had occurred at the time that building construction went ahead in an area that is known by the local people to be an Aboriginal burial site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express concern that the intervention by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) came so late in the process. It would have been far more useful to have an earlier intervention on this matter. While I think it is very welcome that an area of such significance should have that stay of execution order on the construction, and it deserves the kind of detailed consultation with local people that is now being arranged, I do feel that it has come a bit late in the day. I concur with people who feel concerned that it is perhaps occurring at a very late stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, if I have the right to make comparisons, as Senator Campbell has made comparisons, I mention a very similar case&mdash;the Swan Brewery development in Western Australia. I must confess that it is with extreme gratitude that I realise that the construction of the bridge has not gone ahead, unlike the very undesirable state of affairs in Western Australia where a shell of a building has actually been constructed over an area of acknowledged significance for Aboriginal people. In this case the construction of the bridge could go ahead and it could be very damaging, but it has not gone ahead as yet. I think it is imperative that this stay of execution be supported, and whatever time is required for proper investigation and consultation to occur should be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the environmental issues, I think enough has been said. It is a unique area which is highly significant. Damage will occur unless the planning that goes ahead takes into consideration the amount of traffic that is already going onto the island through the ferry system and how much that would change if there were a toll bridge and an opening up of that island area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell also acknowledged that this area was one of the most densely populated areas of Australia prior to European settlement. Its significance in terms of Aboriginal middens and burial sites is well known. Senator Teague expressed bewilderment at the lack of comment on the significance of this site. Basically, that is the reason that I am now speaking. When I visited the site and spoke with local people, I discovered that the Aboriginal significance actually has to do with women's dreaming. There are constraints over the women; they have never spoken out openly in the past about their sacred areas. There is a reluctance over, if not a taboo on, speaking publicly in the presence of men about the reasons why this area is extremely sacred and important to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I commend the minister for Aboriginal affairs for having appointed a woman to do the research into this area. Without that appointment, I think the full amount of information would not come to light. We would not be able to see what the true story is for Aboriginal people of that area. So that explains the surprise that some people have felt about the new outspokenness on the part of the community, and many women in the community, regarding this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also stress that a wonderful thing has occurred in the community as a result of this sharing of environmental and Aboriginal concerns; that is, the reconciliation potential. There has been a recognition of the ecological importance of the area because of the international Ramsar agreement regarding bird migration paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collective effort of the Ngarendjeri and other Aboriginal peoples, the local residents of Goolwa and Hindmarsh-Kumarangk Island, the trade union movement and environment organisations to protect our heritage is an all too rare example of Aboriginal-white Australian reconciliation in action. I have here a very moving submission from a person by the name of John Rice, whom I met when I attended the protest. He goes through the issue of the bridge at Goolwa, saying how much larger it is than a monetary or development issue because it contains elements of physical, cultural, spiritual, emotional and moral aspects. I stress that it is a very valuable and moving synthesis of the reasons why this issue is not simply a South Australian, environmental, Aboriginal, heritage or tourism issue but is a national issue that deserves the importance it is  currently being given by the minister's order.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for inquiry and report by the last day of sitting in September 1994: The adequacy and appropriateness of the operation, funding and resourcing of research relating to rural industries by the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to please ignore the paper that was circulated twice this afternoon, indicating my intention to amend that motion. That will be left, if he so desires, in the hands of Senator Coulter. The motivating factor in moving the motion was the surge of representations from CSIRO scientists and employees right around Australia, including bodies in Western Australia. The calls from these scientists have been supported by the peak rural bodies in Western Australia, so I apologise to nobody for calling for such an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem at hand is that CSIRO top management is about to consider the position of up to 200 staff, consisting mainly of agricultural scientists in the agricultural divisions, mainly as a result of the short- to medium-term budget cuts to eight agricultural divisions around Australia on 25 May. It is not as though there have not been past staff reductions. I believe that, irrespective of their status, all organisations in Australia have to go through some restructuring to meet the demands of modern times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute of Animal Production and Processing has taken the brunt of redundancies in the past three years. It is not as though this section has not been the subject of a certain amount of restructuring but this restructuring seems to be occurring mainly in the agricultural sector. To back up that argument, it should be noted that, in 1991-92, of a total of 103 redundancies in the CSIRO, 67 were agricultural scientists&mdash;65 per cent. In 1992-93, of 115 CSIRO personnel made redundant, 67 were agricultural scientists. Until 13 May 1994, 114 agricultural scientists were made redundant out of a total of 182 redundancies. In this and many other ways the dice are loaded against the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO and other research organisations within departments of agriculture around Australia under the auspices of state governments need to be looked at in terms of the next 25 years rather than in the short term as has occurred under this federal government. The government should harness the zealous research work of agricultural scientists and set specific goals for each agricultural commodity so that we can meet the demands of the future. Concrete proposals are needed to harness and keep in Australia the top agricultural scientists that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day, in answer to a question by Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Collins said that there is record funding in Australia for agricultural research. However, in saying that, Senator Collins did not point out to the Senate that he was taking into consideration all of the agricultural research around Australia, including all departments of agriculture which, of course, are paid for by state governments and have nothing to do with the federal government, thus belying the fact that the CSIRO had had its agricultural based funding cut. We need to harness the talents of those CSIRO agricultural scientists and keep them in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to see is a further brain drain to competing countries. The brain drain of agricultural scientists has already started to places like Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, and those countries are receiving the benefit of the written research and minds of those scientists. The other day I heard Senator Cook say that the frontiers of science never cease to expand. That was a motherhood statement that we knew of without him telling us, but it demonstrated the disastrous effects of the brain drain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most famous example of such a brain drain that I can think of&mdash;perhaps you, Mr Acting Deputy President, could think of more famous examples&mdash;is Marconi.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the biggest worries I have with top agricultural scientists leaving Australia for other parts of the world because those other countries will then use their research when competing against us in world markets. Selling off Australian research stations is forcing Australian agricultural scientists to commit professional suicide, especially those research stations that were bought by levies. I refer to a document that I received the other day. As I said earlier in this place, one station that I am particularly concerned about is Yallanbee in Western Australia, although there are plenty of others on the list to be sold off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yallanbee is CSIRO's only experimental research farm for Australia's mediterranean region, which stretches from north-western Victoria through South Australia and Western Australia. The CSIRO has been told that has to be sold and shifted to Katanning, which has a different environment altogether. As a sideline, it also appears that half of CSIRO's Yallanbee station, 1,100 hectares of research farm, has been paid for by wool growers, yet proceeds from the sale would not go back to wool growers. This situation is because of the fact that CSIRO, no doubt under instruction from the government, has been told to sell these research places off to fund the government's deficit or to fund the budget cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These stations have had ongoing programs to provide animals for the research itself, to provide a site for field experiments and to provide stock feed for animal houses and adjoining laboratories. Selling off is not the same as selling off an airport. If an airport is sold off, Australia still gets the benefit. That station is an example, but there are plenty of others in the same situation. Agricultural research farms are our own laboratories&mdash;as you well know from your own state of Tasmania, Mr Deputy President&mdash;without which our agricultural scientists cannot work, or it means that their work is dramatically reduced if they have to go elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go through the specific reasons why funding for agricultural research has declined in the past. First, there are ongoing funding cuts and increasing difficulty in winning Australian wool research and processing. Secondly, AWRAP research grants for CSIRO in some respects duplicate the extension of the research approach of these state departments and only concentrate on practical research projects rather than the hows and whys of agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding crisis within CSIRO's agricultural divisions has even forced an axing of this practical research. The reasons for crisis in research are: the six agricultural stations have virtually lost their external funding. AWRAP, which had a different name before, has eliminated 80 to 90 per cent of the research arm. There has been a big downturn in the price of wool in Australia, unfortunately, so that the levies from those sales have gone down. While we are facing a smaller amount of levies, one would think that the government would be more interested in putting in extra funds until the woollen industry comes back&mdash;and it will. I have said that often enough in this place. The market is showing that the price of wool is coming back, although production has gone down&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if it keeps going we will get back to somewhere near a reasonable price. One would think that the government would be interested in increasing funding rather than eliminating it. I have given the reasons, namely, the collapse of the wool fixed price. Of course, we all remember the price of 700c a kilo under the floor price scheme, and we remember that debate. Half of one per cent of the sale of every bale of wool is taxed to fund research. But if the price is not there, so the research money goes down. As a result, wool growers' contribution to research has fallen dramatically. It has been aggravated because the federal government's dollar for dollar basis has gone down with those levies. I have already said, and I will repeat it in case it has not sunk in, that is the reason for the government increasing funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did we see? CSIRO's overall budget was cut by six per cent in the overall scheme. There was a change of course in the priorities for CSIRO research initiated by a couple of former ministers in this place. Through the McKinsey report, CSIRO was told to shift focus. This is a government and a minister who tell us that they do not direct an independent body. We were told last week that CSIRO was an independent body, yet it cannot give us a briefing. If someone from CSIRO, uninvited by me, arrives at my door and asks if I would like a briefing, would I not say yes? But I have to have present one of the minister's henchmen, although the minister denies that he gives these sorts of instructions. I declined that briefing because I was not going to be told who comes to my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO has been told to shift the focus away from agricultural research and put it as its least important priority. I would like to hear the minister deny that. The McKinsey report recommended that CSIRO concentrate on small to medium business, where a small business has been defined as employing at least 20 employees and having an annual turnover of $2 million. I have no problem with research into small business as small business is the biggest employer of labour in Australia, but let us find funds for that purpose. But in order to do that, do not take the focus away from some of Australia's most important industries. There are not many farms in Australia, and they are mostly family farms, that employ 20 people. There are not many farms in Australia with a turnover of $2 million. This has disenfranchised and excluded research to serve Australia's 50,000 farmers who are helping to carry this country but who are no longer defined. I always took farming to be a small business, and Senator Jones obviously agrees with me. But now we have been defined out, not legislated out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO's agricultural division has also lost access to CSIRO's priority fund source created by a one per cent plus tax on all 38 division budgets and then allocated to priority funded research projects. Internal announcements by the chief executive officer of CSIRO show that priority will be given to buildings rather than to retaining staff. Some of the CSIRO divisions directly affected and facing staff cuts later in this month are as follows: tropical animal production; animal production itself as a different subject; plant industry; tropical crops and pastures; animal health; wool technology; entomology; and half of the Division of Soils. That is how this government is treating agricultural research in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening remarks, this inquiry was sought by the agricultural scientists. It was not, as Senator Cook said, that members of the coalition went to CSIRO demanding to be heard and to sit in on its deliberations&mdash;yet he wants one of his henchmen to sit in on any sort of briefing that we have. The push for this inquiry came from those scientists around Australia. Senator Murphy can laugh as much as he likes&mdash;it shows what he thinks of the farmers of Tasmania&mdash;but that is the situation. Perhaps when he goes back to Tasmania on the weekend he can explain to the farmers down there why he was laughing at their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as there was a hint of an inquiry into the CSIRO the paperwork started pouring in, encouraging us to carry on. We did not go out and create a demand for an inquiry. The committee in question is busy enough without taking on extra inquiries. But in this case it</PARA>
<PARA>was demanded by those people out there. We claim to be the clever country, so let us look into the concerns of those clever people and not have Senator Cook telling us how to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientists are speaking with one voice. Not one of my colleagues has told me that they have heard a differing view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, as a Tasmanian senator I hope that I will be able to make a useful contribution to this debate, unlike Senator Murphy with his interjections and facial contortions. The CSIRO is a very proud national institution which has been gutted by Senator Murphy's Labor Party. Labor's record in this area is nothing short of appalling. While it is good to see the Australian Democrats agreeing to this motion, it is a pity that they and the Greens were not able to protect the CSIRO in their budget negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sensitivity of the ALP in this area is highlighted by the refusal of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, to allow Senator Panizza and me to have a briefing with CSIRO staff. In fact, it was the staff who approached us for a briefing. The minister disallowed that on the basis that he wanted someone he euphemistically referred to as an independent notetaker&mdash;someone who just happened to be from the minister's office&mdash;to be present. He sought to justify that requirement by saying that it was for the protection of both CSIRO staff and the senators involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the minister that neither Senator Panizza nor I require protection and I am sure that the staff did not think that they required protection. Nevertheless, the minister won the day. His attitude has been similar to that of the former holder of the portfolio, Senator Schacht, when he required my good friend and colleague Senator Calvert to have people present when he was seeking information concerning the proposed closure of the marine division in Tasmania. This extraordinary interference by a minister in the affairs of an independent statutory body clearly highlights the need for this inquiry. </PARA>

How does the economic return on agricultural research at CSIRO compare with that for other sectors of CSIRO's research activities? Is the ratio of administrative staff per scientist justified?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The researchers need their different sites because the differing locations provide for research on different soil types, climatic conditions, predators, diseases, et cetera. To deny the researchers these sites is like denying a scientist his or her laboratory. The major site changes mooted will devastate the CSIRO as an effective research entity and reduce staff morale to absolute rock bottom. Whilst it is accepted that some of CSIRO's difficulties arise from a decline in wool research funding, the government's appropriation to CSIRO is budgeted to decrease by 12 per cent in today's terms over the next three years. Cuts in research support funding are exactly the same as cuts in research funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document that the Labor Party heralded as Working Nation stressed the need for employment.

However, these three are the ones who are promoting this motion, and none of them took advantage of the opportunity that the parliament affords to find out the facts. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on their abysmal ignorance and the facts that no-one who knows the fact from any of the other parties that I have referred to has come forward to support them at this stage, there is a case to be answered here in just terms of parliamentary conduct: whether we take the forms and organisations of this place as responsible and deal with them in a proper and responsible manner, quiz the various authorities in a proper and responsible way and enable a smooth running of the place, or whether we introduce out of the blue motions such as this because the mood seizes us. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another factor I should touch on before I go to what the government would put as the merit of its position, and that is that a red herring has been drawn across this debate and referred to by the last two speakers over what the CSIRO's ruling is concerning access to CSIRO officials by parliamentarians. At basis, it is not, of course, to interfere with the professional expression of opinion by any CSIRO officer at all. Allegations of that sort are just not true. Nor is it to do anything other than ensure that officers of the CSIRO are protected from becoming political footballs by there being an objective body of recording of what it was they said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any reason to show why that is necessary, let me go no further than Senator Abetz's last remark. He selected a name of a professional officer of the CSIRO and described some of this professional officer's utterances as unbelievable. He then went on to say that a memorandum allegedly penned by this officer is an absolute disgrace. That is, I gather, the non-professional opinion of a backbench politician in this place about what a professional does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has he done by doing this? He has introduced in public debate the name of a professional officer of the CSIRO and then derided that person's professional opinion under the coverage of parliament without there being an ability of that  person necessarily to reply. I think that is disgraceful. That is why an objective, independent record of conversation should be kept on all of these occasions so that the facts of the matter can be made clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue at hand. The starting point in any logical dissertation on a subject such as this should be to find out what the act setting up the CSIRO provides for it to do? Subsection 9(1)(a) of the Science and Industry Research Act sets down the functions of the organisation. It would serve honourable senators opposite well to read the organisation's objectives that they are complaining about because the objectives are quite clear. Subsection 9(1)(a) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)to carry out scientific research for any of the following purposes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) assisting Australian industry;</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that point, `assisting Australian industry', when I deal with remuneration achieved by the CSIRO by selling of its services to Australian industry, which goes in part to what rural Australia does do by buying some of these services as consultancies or as research commissioned by them. It goes to some of the terms of reference put down by Senator Coulter, who seems to suggest in those terms of  reference that perhaps there is some imbalance here and perhaps the Australian industry requirement is distorting the priorities of the CSIRO&mdash;at least that is the implication of the terms of reference. It is a direct obligation on the organisation to work in assisting Australian industry in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the objectives of the CSIRO set out in this act as a matter of public record are clear and the CSIRO is, and let me say this clearly now, adhering to those objectives. As the minister responsible for this authority, I have full confidence in its board and executive to discharge the obligation it is charged with by this parliament, and I believe it to be doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the government's role in relation to the CSIRO. We bring forward, and parliament decides, the act which sets down its objectives. That is point one. Point two is that the government&mdash;and I am the recommending minister to Cabinet, which then makes recommendations to the Governor-General&mdash;constitutes the board of the CSIRO. We have an eminent and well-respected board of Australian citizens whose qualifications are, in terms of the job they have to do, without par. They deserve the respect of this parliament. I think Senator Panizza's motion seeks to undermine them, as I propose to demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That board fixes priorities under its strategic plan and notifies them to me, as minister. I, as minister, have a chance&mdash;if I want to&mdash;to use a section of the act to direct the board. I have not done so. It has brought forward its strategic plan; the one for this financial year is to come forward shortly. In the best consideration of the priorities of the organisation, and within its budget&mdash;a point recognised by opposition spokespersons in the past, and I am sure not denied by them now&mdash;it recognises the appropriate priorities for Australia's premier science research institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those priorities, by and large, are applied research priorities. I hear a lot from Senator Coulter&mdash;he may say something about this later&mdash;about pure science. I have a great and deep interest in seeing that the funding for pure science in this country is appropriate and ensures that we are internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO, while it does some pure science research, is not primarily a pure science agency; it is primarily an applied science agency. When we have done all those things, we appropriate in one line in the budget an allocation of funds to enable the organisation to thus perform. That is the appropriate role of government. That is what we do&mdash;and the organisation carries on from there. The executive and the board, working together, ensure what those priorities are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard in this debate no argument from anyone in the opposition that this is the wrong thing. I have heard in this debate no argument from anyone in the opposition that we should do something else. I have heard in this debate from the opposition an argument that we should not interfere in the CSIRO. Coming from the opposition, this is a laughable proposition because the motion before this parliament is the mother of all interferences possible with the CSIRO. Those opposite cannot sit in this chamber and say to the government that has responsibility to the Australian people, `You can't interfere,' when we are not and when we are abiding by our obligations to the organisation, and then undertake the most disruptive, undermining possible sort of inquiry which interferes fundamentally with the structure of the CSIRO. That is the key reason this government will reject the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Senator Panizza, the author of this motion, put out a press release headed `Cook interferes in the CSIRO', when in fact under this motion he is proposing to interfere more than anyone ever dreamt of. In the context of his press release, I never interfered with the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us pause for a moment and consider what a Senate committee brings to this matter. It will essentially bring to this process the powers of a royal commission with the power to compel evidence to be produced, to compel documents to be brought forward, to censure people and to deal with them in that way. What has been produced here to justify that level of inquiry? Nothing at all!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True to its logical, careful, planned reform of its own agency, the CSIRO is in the process of being part way through a restructuring. At what point of time would an inquiry, which knocks all this into a cocked hat, have the worst effect on an organisation undergoing restructuring? The answer is: about this time. Why do we not just sit back as a parliament, deal with the report of the CSIRO, utilise the forms and techniques of this parliament through its estimates committee process and other forms of inquiry&mdash;such as putting questions on notice or simply asking them&mdash;and allow the CSIRO to discharge its obligations to this country in the way in which over the years it has won an enviable reputation, both internationally and in Australia? Why do we have to have a motion such as this which undermines the authority and standing of the organisation, at a time when it is undergoing sensitive restructuring?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, and as can be freely taken from my remarks, I believe that this motion constitutes an affront to the management of the CSIRO, the reputation of its managers, the efficacy of its board and the careful and logical managerial and administrative responsibility that is put in place to discharge its obligation under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people in this chamber&mdash;and I make this an invitation&mdash;believe that the appropriation of funds that the government has given the CSIRO is improper, if that be the motivation of this inquiry, let them censure the government. I invite them to do so. I ask them not to crawl over the CSIRO in order to embarrass the government. I ask them not to bring it out and require its resources to be misallocated to meet the needs of this inquiry. Also, I ask them not to interfere with the delicate restructuring phase the organisation is now in. Those people need to face up to what they believe to be the fundamental problem, if they believe there is one, and deal with the government. But those opposite should not try to undermine this organisation in the way in which they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion suggests that there is little real interest&mdash;there might be some&mdash;in saying something about funding, but there is interest in getting into the bowels of the CSIRO and its administration. I invite those opposite to step forward and deal with us, if that be the case. But I am afraid that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the present circumstances of the CSIRO? Let me go back to 1987-88. In that year the CSIRO commissioned a report, a report that any administrative organisation would itself commission in order from time to time to check that it was operating properly. This was a report by the McKinsey organisation. Its report to the CSIRO recommended several things. I have heard the name of that report canvassed in this place as if it were some foul, underhanded thing. This is a reasonable, proper and logical thing for an organisation such as the CSIRO to do&mdash;namely, invite a consultant to examine and report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What comes forward by way of recommendation does not necessarily mean it is adopted automatically. What the CSIRO management has done is get that report from the McKinsey organisation and it has thoughtfully gone about proposing change within the structure of the organisation. A key reform that came through from that report is that it brought together both the production and the productivity sectors of the organisation in their institutes, and virtually integrated the raw materials and value-adding functions of the CSIRO. Frankly, I think that is a commendable step forward because for too long we have concentrated in this country on raw material production and not enough on thinking about how we add value to the raw materials we produce and how me might use scientific means to encourage production from that. That is one of the fundamental changes that came forward out of that report, and it is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive has gone further. It has said that in the coming financial year, 1994-95, there will be another investigation and report, this time from an organisation which, I understand, is not yet named. Nonetheless, it is another external review to see how the implementation of its strategic plan is going and whether it is meeting the objectives that it has set. Again, that is a quite reasonable and logical set of external review and analysis of the structure of a responsible organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the organisation had an internal review of its two premier agricultural institutes, one dealing with plant life and the other with animal husbandry, in order to ensure that internally they too were functioning. This Senate comes along on the back of all that and says, `Let's poke our nose around in all this too.' Why I ask, when the organisation is functioning properly and responsibly, having regard to external consultancy advice and within that structure applying a restructuring of the organisation to make sure it remains relevant as the frontiers of science change in Australia, and as it needs to ensure that Australia is up to date and across all those changes&mdash;and able to reflect them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are, as I have said, clear, logical and cogent reasons why this organisation should be left alone and not dragged into this type of inquiry. I have not yet heard Senator Coulter. In his previous statements he has talked about pure science&mdash;something on which I have a fundamental agreement with him&mdash;but perhaps we part when it comes to accommodating that in a budgetary way because the government has a responsibility for budgets and the Democrats do not. I have heard from Senator Panizza and Senator Abetz that they would like some more research centres, or they would like some research centres to be kept open. That is what they would like. </PARA>

I could say to Senator Panizza that he may want to drag the CSIRO into this debate in order to enhance his political reputation and serve his own precious little self-interest group in the community, but that is a distortion of values and it is one that we will not agree to in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now go to the record of this government on rural research. Australia's rural research and development in general, and the CSIRO in particular, is a well-funded effort in this country. Australia is a leading source in the world of scientific papers on agricultural research. It is often the most frequently quoted source of research by other nations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary industry and energy output in this country is important, and it is an important element of the total economy of Australia. It represents, however, 4.3 per cent of our GDP and 23 per cent of our exports. It is important that we give it due recognition but it is not the only thing. There are other elements of the economy that are important, that require recognition and require elevation. They represent a bigger share. In setting priorities one has to have regard for those as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural focus for the CSIRO in funding is best demonstrated by going to the figures. In the 1993-94 budget year the CSIRO spent 40 per cent of its budget on rural research in one form or another. Some who come from the mining sector, the manufacturing sector, or environmental science, might say that that is a distortion of priorities and it should have gone elsewhere. That is what the organisation did. For the coalition to pretend that the CSIRO does not focus itself on research and development in rural Australia is to argue that the priorities of the other sectors should be relegated further than they are. I would like to hear the opposition explain that to those other sectors. Forty per cent of the total budget in any person's language is a substantial percentage when it accounts for 4.3 per cent of overall GDP in a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be argued that the CSIRO should spend money in other areas. It could be argued that it could spend some more money in molecular biology. The CSIRO, when it spent money in molecular biology in Australia, was able to come up with the world's first breakthrough on gene shears. When those opposite talk about giving it all to the rural area, they should look at what the organisation has been able to achieve in other areas. If the CSIRO reorganised its priorities, as it is trying to logically and reasonably do, we may in fact come forward with further breakthroughs and that would be important for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 budget year, on agricultural research in its two premier institutes in the CSIRO, the government funded $140 million; on primary industry research and development in other sources the government funded $126 million; for university funded primary industry research we funded $85 million; and through cooperative research centres we funded another $20 million. Therefore, out of the taxpayers' pocket in this current financial year we have spent $370 million in rural research direct from government outlays. That is not a small amount of money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this current financial year the intention of the CSIRO, following the allocation of funds to it by this government, is to spend on the two largest institutes, the Animal Production and Processing Institute and the Plant Production and Processing Institute, about $158 million. That is an increase of $140 million from what was spent in the current financial year. So we can see that that is again a recognition of the important priority agricultural research has and of the important dominant position it obtains within the cost structure of the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the fundamental point. The CSIRO's charter&mdash;its act&mdash;requires it to deal with all Australian industry, not just one industry. What would the debilitating effects of this inquiry be on the organisation itself? In the first instance, it does reflect on the management, no matter how those opposite might pretend otherwise. Those opposite are inquiring into priority setting by CSIRO management; the means of administration that that management adopts; the way in which it goes about consulting rural organisations and others to set its priorities; and how it lets its outside consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite want to conduct an inquiry, clearly that is not good enough. They cannot ignore the fact that they are reflecting on both the board and the management of this organisation. The board started about setting goals for the organisation back in 1991. It involved all the stakeholders in the organisation getting a clear direction and providing leadership for the CSIRO. The CSIRO&mdash;now three years old&mdash;because of those steps is regarded internationally as the model organisation for other science institutes to follow in this form of administration: how to set goals, how to consult, how to involve the community; and how to go about determining priorities. Those opposite are reflecting on an internationally recognised organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also reflects on the ability of an organisation to adapt and change. I have often said in debates about the CSIRO that things in science change because knowledge is discovered and new things are learnt. Therefore, priorities change accordingly. We cannot have a snapshot from the 1930s or a snapshot from the 1950s and say that things were set then; agricultural funding got almost all the money, therefore it must continue for ever and a day to get all the money. We just cannot say that because it is a denial of the obvious fact about the nature of the enterprise itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal setting methodology adopted by the CSIRO essentially has four criteria. They are to look at the potential benefits from the research that is to be undertaken; to look at Australia's ability to capture something of value from those benefits and keep and develop it here; to look at the research and development potential that might come from those further exercises; and to look at the research and development capacity of the organisation as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there are currently 46 different levels of inquiry into the CSIRO, including a broad inquiry into science funding in Australia by the Industry Commission. Does anyone in this chamber have any idea about the massive allocation of resources that it takes an organisation such as this to meet that demand? It takes a huge allocation of resources which is a tariff or a tax on the funding of that organisation and which takes money away from its scientific effort. The broad ranging `poke your nose into every damn thing that is going' type of inquiry proposed here would again be an inquiry which would take substantial resources away from the CSIRO, and one that we would not support as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could make many more remarks. However, let me come to a conclusion. It seems to me that one of the key points that the opposition has made is that, in the course of this goal setting and priority distillation process, the CSIRO will be consolidating its activities from 27 sites to 17 sites. Reducing and consolidating the sites has been said to be a major problem for the opposition. The CSIRO is developing a critical mass to more effectively spend its funds on scientific research. It is doing this by removing the overhead costs of different institutions, by overcoming the communications and maintenance costs of buildings and by overcoming the problem of travel and extra administration. By doing that and taking funds out of all of those areas, the CSIRO, through this consolidation process, is able to put more funds where they are necessary in the targeted area of real research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that will lead to reductions in staff over three years in a phased-down way, they will not be in scientific research. The CSIRO itself, I understand, has said that the reduction in scientists from their research activities will be a total of three&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;people. While people in this chamber bandy around other figures such as 143, they are not reductions in the scientific research capability of the organisation. Those senators misrepresent the position in an effort to try to stampede people into confusion, worry and concern about their own futures. They are reprehensible and must be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time the opposition indicated its policy on science, it did so in a document it now seeks to ignore. It did so in a document it called Fightback. In that document&mdash;I refer this to all members of the opposition present in the chamber&mdash;the opposition proposed to reduce funding to the CSIRO by imposing a higher levy on that organisation through efficiency gains. When we look more broadly at the allocation of the funding to the science effort under Fightback, we see that the opposition proposed to reduce across-the-board funding of science in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition may not wish to know about this any more. It does not have a policy at present but the last one we know of was to cut funds. Those opposite should not come in here and tell me or lecture me about what the government has done by increasing base line funding to the CSIRO when their last declared policy position was to cut funds and when their shadow science minister, who obviously ought to have a say in this debate, does not have the guts to come in here and put the position on behalf of the coalition. His absence is noted&mdash;it is noted by me&mdash;it will be drawn to the attention of the science community and he will have a case to answer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) was filibustering, bearing in mind that this debate will be concluded in about 15 minutes time. He seemed to be arguing very much like a yo-yo. At various points he seemed to be saying, `I am the minister. I am responsible,' and heaping this onto the government. At other times, he seemed to be trying to argue that the CSIRO is completely independent. He cannot have it both ways. Throughout his speech he argued one way and then alternately the other way. Clearly, the minister and the government do not have any notion of the proper division of responsibility of CSIRO and its scientists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook also made a quite incredible remark. He repeated several times that of course the rural industries are responsible for only 4.3 per cent of GDP. He was rather implying that we could cut out all rural activity altogether. It reminded me of that American economist who not so long ago said, `Food production in America is only five per cent of America's GDP. We can do without that.' Of course, the truth is that we depend far more fundamentally on rural research and agricultural production than is represented as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up on a question asked by Senator Abetz about whether the Australian Democrats had put a proposal to government for increased CSIRO spending. The answer is that, yes, we did. The fact of the matter is that we put a very balanced alternative to the government in which all the expenditures would be fully financed by income. Included in that was a substantial increase in the budget for CSIRO. But, of course, the government chose not to do that. I put on the record again that, over the next three years, on average CSIRO will be $20 1/2 million less well off than it was during the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook implied that somehow or other the CSIRO was independent, it was making its own way. A number of things have been imposed on the CSIRO by this government, and it is about time that we had a look at the effect of that on the CSIRO's activity. I mention, for instance, the requirement for 30 per cent funding from private sources. That has been imposed on the CSIRO by this government. A feature of the rural industry at this time is that, with the rural downturn, the funding from those sources has become much less, particularly in relation to the wool levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why CSIRO's divisions in the rural area are having difficulty with their funding. This bears very much on one of the subterms of reference that I will shortly be moving as an amendment&mdash;that is, the need for countercyclical government funding to maintain long-term research. If the CSIRO is to undertake long-term rural research, we simply cannot have research which goes up and down with the supply of funds. We must put in place a system under which, if someone is 30 per cent dependent on private sources and those sources are incapable of meeting that 30 per cent, the government bridges that gap&mdash;it must put in more during that time. It is precisely due to that type of research that the rural industries will get themselves out of the hole in which they are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several years ago, when John Button was the minister responsible for this area, senators may recall that I asked him how much time was spent by CSIRO scientists making out grant applications in seeking funding.

In fact, John Button went on to say in his reply to me that it was an advantage that this amount of time and effort was expended in this way because `it helps set the agenda for the CSIRO'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supporting this motion. In fact, in a press release which I put out the day before Senator Panizza gave notice of this motion, I called for an inquiry into CSIRO. I foreshadow that as an amendment to the motion I will move the additional nine points which have been circulated to the Senate. I include among those&mdash;and I understand Senator Panizza might have mentioned an earlier date for reporting&mdash;the requirement that the committee report by the last sitting day in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment says that the committee will inquire into particular matters especially as they relate to rural research. So it is related to rural research specifically, not the CSIRO in general. The first point refers to the structure and administration of CSIRO. It has already been mentioned by the minister that CSIRO is administered by a board. It has a corporate structure similar to private business. But to whom is the board answerable? There are no shareholders in CSIRO. In fact, the board is acting in a way without parallel. Indeed, many of the board members are people who have particular business interests. For instance, I believe that Adrian Clarke has been given a directorship on the board of the AMP. These sorts of things raise questions about conflicts of interest and I think it is about time, given that these conditions have been imposed on CSIRO by this government, that these matters are inquired into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point refers to the sources and adequacies of research funding. I think it is quite clear from what is happening to CSIRO that the sources are inadequate. The minister claimed that only three scientists would be dismissed. I suggest that this figure is grossly misleading. It is clear that a total of 331 staff are expected to leave CSIRO as a result of the exercise already referred to by Senator Abetz. The figure includes 148 staff who are expected to accept redundancy rather than relocate to other sites, plus 183 forced redundancies. Taking into account the anticipated rehiring of some 187 new staff, the net loss is 144 positions. Of these, three are claimed to be research scientists, but in real terms a significant proportion of these positions would be considered research staff. As an example, over 50 per cent of the staff of this particular laboratory we are talking about are directly involved in research. The following statement comes from one of the CSIRO's scientists:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important factor not considered in retaining the critical research capacity is the training of the rehired research staff, and this typically takes from three to five years and will put massive constraints on the ability of the divisions involved to provide the research outcomes essential to ensure the survival of the industry at this critical time when recovery is in sight.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the minister's statement today about sitting in judgment over them when they provide evidence, I will not reveal the name of the person who wrote to me, but I assure the Senate it comes from a CSIRO scientist. The sources and adequacy of research funding need to be looked at and, as I have already mentioned, there is a need for countercyclical government funding to maintain long-term research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point refers to the influence of private funding on effectiveness and direction of research. I have already referred to the fact that the 30 per cent funding from private sources, together with the structure of the board and the way in which CSIRO is administered, I believe, may well be distorting the direction of research in CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point refers to the benefit of rural compared with other research. The point has already been made by Senator Abetz that the rural and agricultural divisions have borne the brunt of cuts in recent years. Roughly 50 per cent of the attrition of CSIRO staff over the last three years has come from those divisions, and far less from the other divisions. I accept the minister's point that certainly one can restructure these activities, but the scientists are very concerned that the $173 million in potential court costs faced by CSIRO is being spread equally across all the divisions, whereas the appropriations are certainly not. The question of the actual cost benefit ratio of rural research compared with research in other divisions is something that needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth point refers to the adequacy of the structure of commercialisation of research results. I think the fact that CSIRO has involved itself in several court actions, one of which has already proved to be a very expensive court action and one which has that potential, indicates that the structure by which CSIRO is seeking this commercialisation research certainly needs to be looked at. Point seven refers to how the costs and benefits of this commercialisation are distributed, and the costs and benefits between the divisions. Finally, there is the effectiveness of communication between CSIRO and the community. That, again, is a point made very strongly by a number of CSIRO scientists. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to make two more points. Senator Cook was rather dismissive of the fact that some of us had not been to the estimates committee and asked questions. I think all senators will know that I have certainly asked a number of questions in the chamber here in question time, but the answers I have received from the minister have led me to not believe those answers. The same thing happens at estimates&mdash;one gets replies through the minister. The minister is there and is answering on behalf of senior people. I am not satisfied with answers being filtered through the minister; I want direct answers. I want scientists to be able to come before the committee to provide evidence directly of the concerns which they are now privately providing both to me and, clearly, to members of the opposition. I simply do not accept that criticism from the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I simply say that considerable concerns have been raised within some of the divisions in relation to the closure of some of the laboratories. That point has already been raised. The other day I read into the record a letter from another CSIRO scientist relating to the Long Pocket research station in Brisbane. One of the senior scientists there said that one of the options available is the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- remaining at Long Pocket with no administrative, computer maintenance, library, workshop, store, meeting room, reception, parking or social facilities, or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">- relocation entailing construction costs for replacement of quarantine, office, laboratory, insectary and glasshouse facilities in excess of $8 million which, when combined with other expenses, would appear to be more than could be realised by sale of the Long Pocket site.</PARA>
<PARA>I think one needs to be very careful when saying that CSIRO is necessarily closing these particular laboratories with the idea of improving its functioning. Certain conditions have been imposed on CSIRO by this government through its funding cuts; they have been imposed on CSIRO by the 30 per cent requirement for private sources funding. This government even imposed an efficiency dividend on working scientists as though somehow or other every year we can cut a percentage from scientific activity and make scientists more efficient. Nothing could be more silly, but it indicates the degree to which this government has intruded directly into the day-to-day operation of this organisation. It is not as independent as the minister at various points in his remarks was trying to make out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reference needs to be very strongly supported; I am pleased that the opposition has put it up. I hope the opposition will also see fit to support this amplification of the terms of reference that I have moved, and that we can get under way with this inquiry as quickly as possible. </PARA>

God or the hand of fate provided 12 hours of calm. It proved long enough to throw the human cannon fodder ashore. The Americans, the Canadians, the British, and the troops of occupied Europe, including the French and the Poles, all played their part. This was to be an action between fighting soldiers, not merely machines or computers. Never again would a war be fought in such human terms, if that is an appropriate way of putting it. If the weather had turned nasty, the great armada could have gone the same way as the Spanish Armada did 400 years before. Today, we would be commemorating a disaster, not a great feat as we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why time was of the essence was that the might of the German war machine was far from dead.

Anybody who takes the time to look at each and every one of the electorates, the margins, the results and the very wide areas that come out, will see that the people of the Northern Territory chose very deliberately a Country Liberal Party government in all of those seats.

Two very important candidates for the Labor Party: Mr Rioli and Mr Lanhupuy, both of whom were Aboriginal candidates for the Labor Party. But the Labor Party chose, on the campus of the Northern Territory University, in a pamphlet marked, `Top End Candidates' to leave them out. Why was that done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in question time today, I mentioned the point that a senior staffer of Senator Collins was very obviously seconded to play an important role in this election campaign very early in the piece. A staffer of Mr Ede, Mr Jamie Gallagher, was given the original job of being the Labor Party apparatchik in pulling together all of those issues that affected this campaign. His contribution collapsed in the first couple of days because he used an advertisement in which he featured southern actors purporting to be Northern Territory people saying what was wrong with the Country-Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Gallagher exited from the picture and Brian Johnson was brought up from Canberra from the staff of Senator Collins and, behind the scenes, was very involved every day and in every issue of that entire campaign in that area. So Senator Collins has to take full responsibility for much of what happened in the Labor Party camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Collins was not seen for the second half of the election campaign&mdash;he did not feature. After he made a major blunder in his comments on the Cannonball Run and how it was perceived, the Labor Party strategists very obviously chose to take Senator Collins out of any of the media. One wonders why and what was going on in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also ask some questions about the candidate that the Labor Party put up against the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in the seat of Fannie Bay. This was an imported candidate who came across the boundaries from Kununurra&mdash;the former president of the shire in Western Australia with very close links to the former Western Australian Labor Party and particular premiers. A particular incident is worth recalling. At the wake for the Labor Party on Saturday night in Darwin, when things were being gathered and everything else and the party was trying to muster support for the failed leader of the opposition, Mr Brian Ede&mdash;let me stress the word Brian&mdash;what did Mrs Susan Bradley do? She said, `Come on! Let's hear it. We need three cheers for our leader tonight, Brian Burke.' That says it all about the associations and the links&mdash;`Three cheers for Brian Burke', not Mr Brian Ede. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imported candidate from Western Australia Inc., along with other state parliamentarians, was brought into the Northern Territory, which makes it look very probable that the Labor Party will lose the seat of Victoria River. Senator Collins himself went out there and manned the polling booth at Port Keats on Saturday morning. </PARA>

This failed candidate was also interviewed on the media on Saturday night. One of her first key statements was, `The ALP in Canberra has to do something about the CLP government here, particularly with regard to our funding.' The whole issue of this campaign was that Canberra somehow manipulated and controlled and now here was this hidden threat of the failed candidate, reinforcing what the territory people had very obviously come to realise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins today gave no specific examples except to regurgitate media stories that were pulled off the front page of a couple of newspapers over this particular issue. This was not a campaign based on race. Sure, candidates of political persuasion and independent candidates talked very importantly about Aboriginal issues because Aboriginal people are 25 per cent of the voting population of the Northern Territory and they had a lot at stake in this area. I again need to reinforce that Senator Collins has not been able to present any issues or statements other than to pull out media perceptions often generated by backroom, Labor Party areas. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NT poll opens with race row.</PARA>
<PARA>The opening paragraphs to that story read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NT election campaign blasted off yesterday with a row on Aboriginal policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chief Minister Marshall Perron warned of Labor's "frightening" Aboriginal agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Perron at a media conference claimed that NT Labor would bring "massive change" in a "secret agenda" that would disrupt the Public Service and the legal system&mdash;but he singled out racial issues.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not the Northern Territory Labor Party saying this; it is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> and its accurate front page story. The story went on to quote Mr Perron:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Perron said: "I believe the Labor party. . . had they been in office over the last few years would have been an absolute disaster for the Territory with their Aboriginal agenda which frightens Territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think you will find that most Territorians will agree that the Labor social agenda and the Labor Aboriginal agenda will not be in their interests in the future."</PARA>
<PARA>This is a quote from the Chief Minister. The paper went on to say in its front page lead:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week, Mr Perron claimed Labor planned to introduce softer laws for Aborigines, thus creating what he called a system of "apartheid" in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Chief Minister actually launched his campaign, the centrepiece of his campaign launch, which featured on all of the television news bulletins&mdash;the one piece of his speech that both the ABC and Channel 8 News carried, as he knew they would&mdash;was his statement that the Northern Territory Labor Party, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, was proposing two sets of laws for the Northern Territory to be `soft on Aboriginal offenders'. I make it quite clear that the Chief Minister was not talking about land laws but about the criminal law of the Northern Territory being amended or changed by the Labor Party in such a way that a special deal would be cut for black offenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And Senator Tambling has the unmitigated hide and gall to stand up here with a straight face&mdash;I noticed that he spent only about 30 seconds talking about the racial charges&mdash;and say that this was not a racial campaign. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of the same day, the Darwin based journalist for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Dave Nason, headlined a story:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politics of race key to victory.</PARA>
<PARA>Dave Nason is a very experienced and long-term journalist in Darwin who now works full time for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in Darwin. The story went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the lie was that both know the economy, while important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is both leaders&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will rank behind Aboriginal issues for many of the urban-based swinging voters who will decide the election outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it went on. There are two independent journalists, both writing and quoting the Chief Minister directly, who had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that this was straight for the bottom line. Today's story filed by Gordon Feeney, the Darwin based journalist who writes for AAP, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Race scare sweeps ALP aside in poll.</PARA>
<PARA>The story says&mdash;these are Gordon Feeney's words, and the words of nobody else:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Racial division. The electorate's disdain for southern Australia and its fear of the unknown was the powerful three-pronged attack used by the CLP in its crushing seventh consecutive win.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with any of that, with the addition, of course, of the economic health of the Northern Territory, which I will mention in a minute. Gordon Feeney is a very accurate reporter in my experience. The story goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On May 17th, the day he called the election, Chief Minister Marshall Perron warned the NT electorate was frightened by Labor's Aboriginal agenda. The CLP has long branded Labor `the Aboriginal Labor Party'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is not racist, of course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and friends of the powerful Aboriginal Land Councils, and throughout the CLP campaign there was strong racial undertones. One advertisement warned that Labor would bring in two sets of laws, one for black and one for white Territorians. Then two days before the election, a little-known Aboriginal organisation, which had been holding talks with the CLP, announced a native title claim over vacant crown land in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to that, the Country-Liberal Party was also considering running a television advertisement which singled out the honourable member for Arnhem, Wesley Lanhupuy, now re-elected for a fourth consecutive term, and comparing him as lands minister with Steve Hatton. It got legal advice that it could be the subject of successful legal action if it did that simply in respect of Wesley Lanhupuy, so it compromised and ran a sleazy television advertisement which compared the white ministers who would be out of office in a CLP government with black Aboriginal ministers under an ALP government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were very professional, sleazy advertisements: an American advertisement agency could not have done a better job. They had a colour photograph of Steve Hatton and a black and white photograph of Wesley Lanhupuy. After the last image of Wesley Lanhupuy had left the screen&mdash;that is the last face that people saw&mdash;a voice said, `You have got to be joking.' When it gets to the stage, and Senator Tambling knows this, that a journalist like Frank Alcorta&mdash;whose support for the CLP in every column that he has ever written is well known&mdash;criticises the CLP in the Northern Territory for running racist advertising, I think I can rest my case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said today, and I stand by it, that I was sad, and that is the emotion that I feel, as a long-term territorian who intends to spend the rest of his life in the territory, to see that kind of advertising, that kind of campaign run. I make no apologies for saying it publicly, even though I know it is not the politically smart thing to say. But now that they have done it successfully in the Northern Territory, they are all embarrassed by it, and Senator Tambling and the Chief Minister want to write history and pretend it did not happen. It did happen; there is no question about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the other very important issue, and I acknowledge it, is financial management and economic health of the Northern Territory. There are only two communities in Australia that one can compare in terms of their economic health&mdash;that is, the white part of the electorate, the non-Aboriginal part&mdash;and they are the Northern Territory and the ACT. Both of these places enjoy the highest per capita personal income of any two places in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a substantial reason for that, namely, that 80 per cent of the Northern Territory's budget is provided by the federal Labor government. In addition to that, there are hundreds of millions of dollars a year&mdash;I checked on the ATSIC contribution to the territory alone today&mdash;for Aboriginal programs which enrich the construction community and the business community of the Northern Territory. There are hundreds of millions of dollars in defence spending alone. In fact, there would be no employment in the Northern Territory if it were not for the excellent deal that the Northern Territory gets from the Labor government in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that there could be some irony attached to that, but not as far as I am concerned. As far as Warren Snowdon and I are concerned, the territory will continue to get a good deal out of Labor. That is something that the Northern Territory Labor Party has to be proud of in its Canberra Labor connections. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

That was to be on Tuesday the 10th of May. Ayden Cross stated the following:&mdash;That he was employed at the Seaworld Nara Resort as a bell boy and that on a particular date last year he observed Senator Graham Richardson in the foyer with two in his words "prostitutes". Senator Richardson then left the foyer area.

I then advised Bob Katter who I believe has spoken to the father of Ayden Cross.

<PARA>It is very clear that there is quite substantial evidence to associate former Senator Richardson with the allegations that have been made in this place and in the other place and it is totally and utterly dishonest for this government to say that those of us on this side have no evidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to see this matter properly and thoroughly dealt with.

Until this government ascertains the exact substance of the statement made by Mr Cross and is willing to admit that statements have been made to the Queensland Police  in  relation  to  former Senator Richardson's dealings with prostitutes, we can have no confidence in it and absolutely no confidence in its interest in this matter being properly and thoroughly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time this matter has been raised in the other place by Mr Katter there has been nothing but obfuscation and obstruction from the Labor Party. It is interesting to note that as I walked across the Members Hall today, I went past Mr Leo McLeay, Mr Kerr and Mr Holding&mdash;three of the culprits who took points of order after points of order, none of them having any substance, in an attempt to interrupt Mr Katter's speech. I heard them discussing very loudly how they were going to deal with this particular allegation. They were rehearsing the defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great defence from Labor, the great defence from the party of the worker was, `He is just a bellboy. Who is going to listen to a bellboy? Nobody is going to listen to a bellboy. After all he is only a bell boy.' This is the line that you will hear this government trot out time and time again over the next couple of days. It will try to discredit somebody simply on the basis that he is a young man employed as a bellboy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the credibility of this government. Instead of saying, `We have to take this matter seriously. It is a matter of substance. Let's face it, it has been reported to the Major Crime Squad in Queensland', what will the government's response be? The response of the government will be to attack and vilify the person who has made a statement to the police in good faith. Mr Cross made his statement to the police not just because he was sickened by the fact that former Senator Richardson was involved in these matters but because the following weekend former Senator Richardson was staying at the resort with his wife and family. As the statutory declaration says, Mr Cross found this hard to accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very good reason why this matter has to be taken seriously. Mr Katter has already made it very clear in the House of Representatives that there is a substantial link between Mr Peter Laurance and former Senator Richardson. That link is evidenced by the fact that former Senator Richardson was invited to Mr Laurance's wedding&mdash;people do not invite just anyone off the street to their wedding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Two way trade between Australia and Taiwan has expanded strongly in the past decade. Australian exports to Taiwan grew at an annual average growth rate of more than 16 per cent, from $A737m in 1984 to approximately $A2.8 billion in 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The composition of trade reflects the comparative economic advantage and pattern of industrial development in respective economies. In the case of Australian exports, traditional commodities remain important, although simply transformed manufactures and processed food have gained significance. In 1993, key commodity exports included coal, coking and steaming ($A308m), iron concentrates ($A119m) and crude petroleum ($A24m). Semi-processed metals have grown much stronger than total exports to Taiwan with aluminium unworked recorded growth rate of over 28 per cent, plates and sheets of iron and steel at 48 per cent, iron and steel coils 162 per cent and blooms and billets at over 283 per cent. Exports of semi-processed food and processed food has developed strongly; the most outstanding has been exports of fresh and chilled seafood which has recorded triple digit average growth rate (248 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan exports to Australia have also diversified. While basic manufactured goods (toys, games and  sporting goods, textile yarns, plastics, furniture) have continued to perform well, computers and computer parts have shown spectacular growth performance (from $A14 million and 3 million in 1984 to $A360 million and 231 million in 1993).</PARA>

They identified significant opportunities in infrastructure, health and environmental projects which come under Taiwan's Six Year National Development Plan. In addition, due to rising personal income, Taiwan consumers are demanding more convenient foods and drink, high quality clothing and household goods, leisure and recreation and education services. This restructuring of consumer demand provides `new' areas of trade for Australian business to capture and retain its strong export performance to Taiwan.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1-3) The Medicare levy is essentially a taxation measure which partially finances health care in Australia, and its payment is not related to eligibility for Medicare benefits. It is an income related tax and not conceptually a health insurance premium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy is governed by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986, both of which are administered by the Australian Taxation Office. Medicare eligibility is established under the Health Insurance Act 1973. My Department does not have access to taxation records including data relating to the Medicare levy. Both sets of legislation contain definitions of Australian residency that determine, respectively, a person's liability for income tax (including the Medicare levy) or eligibility for Medicare. However, the respective definitions do not contain common criteria for residency, as they are each intended to fulfil fundamentally different purposes.
