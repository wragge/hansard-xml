<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By letter dated 1 March 1994 under the signature of the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Vanstone, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, pursuant to standing order 81, has raised with me a matter of privilege. The matter raised by the joint committee is the unauthorised disclosure of an unpublished submission made to the committee. The letter from the committee sets out the facts of the matter, which, briefly, are that a submission made to the joint committee in 1991, and not published by the committee or by either house of the parliament, was quoted and tabled in the houses of the South Australian parliament on 4 March 1993. The committee's letter indicates that the committee has sought to investigate the unauthorised disclosure of this document, as recommended by the Committee of Privileges in its 20th report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am required to determine whether a motion to refer this matter to the Committee of Privileges should have precedence, having regard to the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(a)the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(b)the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA>My predecessor, President Sibraa, has explained the interpretation and application of these criteria in a number of previous cases. The principle has been followed that precedence is given to a matter if it is capable of being regarded by the Senate as conforming with criterion (a), and if there is no other readily available remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to criterion (a), the matter is clearly capable of being held by the Senate to meet that criterion, and in past cases the Senate Committee of Privileges and the Senate have made this clear. The unauthorised disclosure of an unpublished submission to a committee is declared by the Senate's privilege resolution No. 6 to be a matter which may be held by the Senate to be a contempt, and is also made a criminal offence by section 13 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to another remedy, the only other remedy for the alleged unauthorised disclosure of the submission would be a prosecution under the act, but that has not been regarded as a readily available remedy in past cases and is certainly not available in this case because the unauthorised disclosure is alleged to have taken place in a state parliament. That may also mean that the Senate is unable to apply any remedy if the facts are as stated by the joint committee, but that is a matter which the Committee of Privileges will no doubt consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore determine that a motion to refer this matter to the Committee of Privileges may have precedence over other business in accordance with standing order 81. I table the letter from the joint committee. Senator Vanstone may now give notice of a motion in accordance with standing order 81.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to facilitate the appointment of a new President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments relate to the proposed appointment as President of Justice Deirdre O'Connor of the Federal Court of Australia. Justice O'Connor has agreed to be recommended to the Governor-General for that appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judge wishes to continue to hold her office as a Federal Court Judge, and has also requested a fixed term appointment of 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed to both requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 is to be amended to provide that a Judge of a court created by the Parliament may concurrently hold the office of President. This is supported by new sections 15A and amendments to section 21. Those provisions make it clear that the tenure and entitlements, including judicial salary, of a Judge who is appointed and serves as President are not affected by that appointment or service. Any difference between the judicial salary and the Presidential salary will be made up by a special allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 16(1A) of the Act provides that the next person appointed as President may have a fixed term of office. This will allow Justice O'Connor to be given the 5 year term which she has requested.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past nine months, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has been inquiring into the law and practice relevant to immigration detention in Australia. The Committee's findings and recommendations on this complex and controversial issue are detailed in the report which I have tabled today, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, Border Control and Detention</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's system of immigration detention has attracted much public comment in the past year. Concerns have been expressed about persons who have arrived at Australia's border without authorisation and subsequent to arrival have sought asylum in Australia. Some of those persons, currently three in number, have been held in detention for over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry, there was general agreement that the long term detention of asylum seekers is unacceptable. In this regard, the Committee has noted that various factors have contributed to the length of detention which has been endured by many of those currently in detention. These factors are discussed in detail in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In examining the issue of immigration detention, it was not the Committee's role to apportion blame for past mistakes, nor to seek to justify past practice. Rather, the Committee was charged with the responsibility of assessing the appropriateness of detention within the context of Australia's orderly migration program. While past experience was relevant to the Committee's deliberations, the Committee was of the view that such experience should not be the sole determinant of future immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal issue for the Committee was whether those who arrive unauthorised at Australia's borders should be allowed to enter and reside in the community while their status is being determined. In this regard, the Committee deliberated extensively on Australia's options and obligations relevant to asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One option for the Committee was to agree with many of the advocacy groups which made submissions to the inquiry and recommend that claiming refugee status upon arrival should guarantee direct entry to Australia. At the opposite end of the scale, the Committee could have decided to support a system whereby those who seek to enter Australia without proper authorisation are turned around at the border, as is occurring in some countries which are faced with a refugee problem of crisis proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has not supported either of these extremes. Rather, the Committee has sought to ensure that Australia continues to provide an appropriate response to those assessed as being refugees, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of Australia's migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the report, the Committee emphasises that Australia must retain its sovereign right to determine who may enter, the conditions under which a non-citizen's entry may be permitted, and the circumstances under which a non-citizen may be permitted to stay or may be removed from Australia. Australia's system of immigration control, which supports Australia's important migration program, must be upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee's principal recommendation is that persons who arrive unauthorised at Australia's borders should be held in detention while their claims to enter Australia are determined, but that there should be a capacity to consider release from detention where the period of detention exceeds six months and certain requirements are met. In the Committee's view, this recommendation strikes an appropriate balance between the need to treat asylum seekers fairly, and the need to ensure that mere arrival in Australia does not become the key to unauthorised long term stay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs should have the capacity to consider release from detention where the detention has exceeded six months, and the continued detention has been brought about because of inaction or administrative error by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Committee considers that the decision should be one for the Minister personally, which should not be delegated. The benefit of this is that the Minister would be accountable to the Parliament whenever the discretion is exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering whether any unauthorised border arrival should become eligible for release, the Minister should take into consideration a range of factors which are listed in the report. These include, among others:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the applicant has a special need on the basis of age, health or previous experiences of torture and trauma;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the applicant is likely to abscond;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether there is a reasonable basis to the applicant's claim to refugee status;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether appropriate support arrangements can be established;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent to which the applicant co-operated with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, particular consideration for release should be given to those who have a special need on the basis of age, health, or previous experiences of torture and trauma.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Committee's proposals, persons who satisfy the relevant criteria in the appropriate circumstances would be made eligible by the Minister for the grant of a bridging visa, which would secure release from detention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee has emphasised that the Minister should not be compelled to exercise the discretion to issue a bridging visa. In addition, the mechanism should be structured to ensure that the Minister's failure to exercise this discretion in any individual case does not invite judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts that its proposals do not go as far as some community groups may have wished. The Committee framed its recommendations after taking into account the totality of evidence provided during the inquiry. In particular, the Committee took account of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the evidence that among those persons who are able to reside in the community while their refugee claims are determined, a significant percentage disappear into the community when they are refused permission to remain in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the reluctance of community groups to become involved in any policing arrangements for ensuring that persons released into the community would not abscond; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the difficulties associated with providing adequate support arrangements if unauthorised border arrivals were released into the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this last point, at public hearings, many community support groups suggested that there would be sufficient support within the community to sustain border asylum seekers in the community. However, when 37 asylum seekers in fact were released into the community during the course of the Committee's inquiry, as a result of an agreement reached between parties in a Federal Court action, it was evident that the reality of the situation did not match the confidence of the community groups. Committee enquiries revealed that those who had agreed to care for those released into the community were experiencing difficulty in providing care and support in the early months following release, and doubts were expressed about their ability to sustain that support in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises that a fair and efficient refugee processing system remains the key to minimising the time spent in detention by unauthorised arrivals. As a result, the Committee has recommended that, as an absolute priority, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Refugee Review Tribunal ensure that the processing of refugee claims by unauthorised border arrivals and persons held in detention be given precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations are based on the evidence that previous time delays in processing of refugee applications largely have been overcome. The latest statistics provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on refugee processing times gave the Committee confidence that the changes to the refugee processing system over the past few years are providing decisions within a reasonable time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of time delays, the Committee has noted that various factors have contributed to the duration of detention endured by certain unauthorised border arrivals. One such factor has been the decision by those refused refugee status at the primary and review stages to pursue litigation to the State Supreme Courts, the Federal Court and the High Court. In the Committee's view, the Government cannot be held responsible for prolonged detention where persons seek to utilise all avenues of the legal process on top of the administrative process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the issue of access to judicial review was the focus of much attention by the Committee. In recent years, there has been an increasing propensity to litigate migration matters in Australia's higher courts. While the Committee acknowledges that appeal systems are important to rectify errors which can be made in such matters as refugee determinations, legal challenges in the migration field, as it currently stands, can be and are used to buy time in Australia, as applicants seek to exploit every avenue and loophole open to them in their bid to remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the increased trend to litigate migration matters must be addressed, and accordingly has recommended:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Judiciary Act 1903 in order to limit the opportunity for challenging refugee determinations in the Federal Court; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the introduction of a leave requirement for applicants appealing or seeking the review of a Migration Act decision in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures for granting or refusing leave applications should ensure that the applications are dealt with expeditiously, and that unmeritorious claims are disposed of by screening as soon as they are filed. While a leave provision may cause some delays in the hearing of cases which have merit, ultimately it should lead to faster decision making overall, by ensuring that unmeritorious cases are not pursued through the court system. This would also ensure earlier departure from Australia of failed asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also considered the role of legal advisers within the refugee determination process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee had some concerns about legal representatives providing asylum seekers with unrealistic expectations of their chances in litigation, the Committee considers that the practice of providing legal assistance to unauthorised border arrivals at the primary and review stages should be continued. Beyond the administrative review stage, any legal assistance should be subject to a merits test. A recommendation to this effect is in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations relevant to immigration detention relate specifically to the new legislative provisions contained in the Migration Reform Act 1992, which is set to come into force on 1 September 1994. The report contains a detailed examination of those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry, the Committee was hampered in its examination of the impact of the new legislation by the lack of information which was available on the regulations which will govern the operation of the Migration Reform Act. Nevertheless, the Committee has identified certain anomalies in the text of the Migration Reform Act which need to be addressed before the commencement of the Act. These are detailed in the report and relate to a number of technical matters on the new procedures for immigration clearance, bridging visas, and judicial review. The Committee has recommended that these anomalies be rectified by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will continue to monitor developments in relation to the Migration Reform Act, in accordance with the Committee's terms of reference, by which it is charged with the responsibility of inquiring into and reporting on any changes and proposed changes to the Migration Act and Regulations, and any related Acts. To this end, the Committee has recommended that, as soon as possible, the Government make available for the scrutiny of the Committee the legislative drafting instructions and operational procedures relevant to the Migration Reform Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 into the Senate on Thursday, 24 February 1994, after this report went to the printer. The Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 as amended by the Migration Reform Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the main focus of the inquiry was the system for immigration detention, the Committee also gave consideration to the facilities in which immigration detainees are held. The Committee examined the operation of, and conditions and services provided within Australia's immigration detention centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many in the community, Australia's immigration detention facilities have become a focal point for the concerns and criticisms regarding Australia's detention policy. During the inquiry, the Committee listened to various complaints and criticisms about the immigration detention centres and sought responses from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Protective Service in relation to those complaints and concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence provided by the Department and APS indicated to the Committee that they are sensitive to the various criticisms which have been made. Both would acknowledge that there have been past difficulties at the detention centres. At the same time, both pointed to a range of improvements which have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from raising relevant matters, the Committee was not in a position, nor was it the Committee's role, to address each and every allegation made. In any case, it is unlikely that the allegations or problems will cease at the end of the inquiry. For this reason, the Committee has supported a suggestion made to it by the Society of St Vincent de Paul that there should be greater opportunity for detainees, their families and community groups to raise concerns about the detention centres and have these concerns addressed. The Committee has recommended the establishment of an Immigration Detention Centres Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, APS, detention centre residents, community service providers, and local community representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advisory committee should consider and make recommendations in relation to the conditions and services within the detention centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also addressed some specific concerns about the education and health services provided at the detention centres. It has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consideration be given to allowing detainee children to attend local schools, in the appropriate circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consideration be given to teaching detainee children in their native language; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where a large group of unauthorised border arrivals from the same nationality are held in a detention centre, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs make every effort to engage the services of medical personnel who can provide regular consultations in the native language of that group of detainees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Committee gave consideration to the location of an immigration reception and processing centre at Port Hedland. Committee members acknowledged the disadvantages of placing detainees in a location away from capital cities, including the problems with accessing appropriate services, the additional costs of transport for departmental staff and legal representatives who are required to travel to Port Hedland as part of the refugee determination process, and the difficulties for detainees in accessing community support. At the same time, Committee members recognised the benefits of placing detainees in a centre which is in reasonable proximity to where most of the boat arrivals first land, and where the remoteness of the location provides a disincentive to abscond from the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, the Committee was of the view that it would be premature to close the Port Hedland facility at this stage. The original reasons for establishing the centre at Port Hedland do not appear to have diminished to any great extent. In the Committee's view, should the number of detainees at the Port Hedland Centre decrease to the extent that operation of the Centre would not be viable, then the Port Hedland Centre should be decommissioned, but with the capacity to recommission the Centre should it be required in the future. Recommendations in this regard are contained in the report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS> supports the broad thrust of Australia's existing immigration detention policy. The committee has sought to ensure that Australia continues to provide an appropriate response to those in need of refuge whilst, at the same time, maintaining the integrity of Australia's migration program and border protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's principal recommendation is that persons who arrive unauthorised at Australia's borders should be held in detention while their claims to enter Australia are determined but that there should be a capacity to consider release from detention where the period of detention exceeds six months and where that continued detention has been brought about by inaction or administrative error by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and certain requirements are met. This recommendation strikes an appropriate balance between the need to treat asylum seekers fairly and the need to ensure that mere arrival in Australia does not become the key to unauthorised long-term stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report will not put Australia out of line with other nations which have unauthorised arrival problems. As the report identifies, most countries have policies of detention, some have even harsher measures, such as turning boats around at sea. The committee rejected the proposal that boats carrying unauthorised arrivals to Australia be turned around at sea. The committee also rejected the proposal that unauthorised arrivals be detained for a short period and then released into the community on a system of bonding or bail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also rejected the suggestion which has been implicit in many submissions that, because people have embarked upon a long and hazardous sea journey and succeeded in reaching Australia, they must be refugees and therefore should be allowed to stay here permanently. The committee did not address the circumstances which prevail in countries from which people had fled, nor was it required to examine conditions in countries to which failed asylum seekers may have to return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that, during the course of the inquiry, the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Short, and I visited Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia on parliamentary business not directly related to the inquiry. However, whilst we were in these countries, we made high-level inquiries about returnees&mdash;people who had returned to their homelands from which they had originally fled. It is pleasing to record in the tabling of this report that over 60,000 people have returned to Vietnam and over 362,000 people have returned to Cambodia. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently convened a meeting of its steering committee of the international conference on Indochinese refugees, which reviewed the situation of 60,000 Vietnamese boat people and 26,000 Lao in camps in South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting recorded that 2,844 people had voluntarily returned to Vietnam in January of this year. The meeting decided to complete work in the first asylum countries under the comprehensive plan of action by the end of next year. This would mean that all camps will be closed at that time. Australia is playing its part in taking those refugees who have been screened from those camps into the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short and I visited some of the camps before and at the conclusion of the aforementioned visit to Indochina. We separately visited the Sikhui camp in Thailand and the Galang Island camp in Indonesia.

We are now in a better position to judge conditions in Australia's detention centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not an inquiry into the detention of Cambodian boat people in Australia, although one could have been led to believe it was because of the emphasis placed on the detained Cambodians in some of the submissions and public evidence taken by the committee. Many submissions, at best, overlooked or, at worse, were not concerned about the fact that people from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Poland, Romania, Vietnam, Somalia, People's Republic of China, Turkey, Nigeria and Macau had all arrived in Australia by boat and had been detained upon arrival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was but one of a number of disturbing features of the inquiry. The very important peace process that Cambodia has been engaged in was judged by some to be unimportant. One could have been led to believe that Pol Pot was still in power in that country and that last May's democratic elections had never happened. The fact that 362,000 people had returned to Cambodia was not thought to be relevant. Forgotten also was the fact that the last boat carrying Cambodian people to arrive on our shores occurred three years ago&mdash;in April 1991. </PARA>

The committee and the report benefited from this evidence, but I record regret that she, and her organisation, had previously ignored the inquiry. Despite a public challenge and invitation to Mr Nick Poynder, a lawyer immediately and directly involved in the detention issue, he did not provide a submission to the committee and therefore did not appear before the committee to substantiate or elaborate upon his much publicised views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak briefly to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS> of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, of which I was the deputy chairman. I support many of the remarks and, in particular, the tabling statement of the chairman of the committee, Senator McKiernan. From the outset, I welcomed the establishment of the inquiry. I note in the dissenting report by Senator Chamarette that she circulated the terms of reference in draft form to the committee at the start, which is correct. But with not undue pride, I would point out to the Senate that some of the statements I made shortly after becoming shadow minister were also a catalyst. There was general support for the inquiry because it was a very important issue. I commend the report to the Senate and to the Australian public. It has been a very interesting, very difficult and sensitive inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has come out with a very detailed and careful analysis. It has produced, with all the sensitivities involved, a very balanced outcome and presentation of the issues, and the recommendations reflect that. I thank all those witnesses who appeared before the committee. We received a very large number of submissions from a very wide range of people and organisations. Those submissions were critical to the committee's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also publicly congratulate Senator McKiernan on his chairmanship of the committee. It was not an easy task, and he did it very well and with grace. I would also like to thank the secretariat; in particular, the secretary of the committee, Andres Lomp, and staff members Dianne Fraser and Elizabeth Copp, and especially the committee's legal adviser, Kathryn Cronin, for the tremendous support and advice that they gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me stress what I see as one of the fundamental underpinnings of any consideration of these matters: the quite fundamental importance of maintaining the integrity of Australia's migration program, which is the envy of most other countries around the world. That is due, importantly, to a range of issues. It is certainly due, quite critically, to our universal visa system. We are also extremely fortunate in having no land borders, and we have an off-shore migration program that few other countries have. The committee agreed, I think unanimously, with the view of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, which is outlined on pages 108 to 111 of the report, that the concept of detention is a control mechanism to ensure that every non-citizen entering or staying on in Australia is authorised to do so, and to ensure that the integrity of the migration program is upheld. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is virtually no dispute on the need for Australia to maintain its policy of detention. The fundamental question that arises is the length of the detention process. Senator Chamarette will have her turn in a moment. There are two extremely important issues that flow from this, as I have just alluded to. There is the length of the detention&mdash;I will come back to that&mdash;but also, and very importantly, the extent, if any, to which the detention regime should differentiate between what to date have been called unauthorised arrivals&mdash;in particular, the so-called boat people&mdash;and, on the other hand, the different category of illegal entrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These latter are mainly people who arrive in Australia legally, quite frequently on visitor visas or the like, and then overstay at the expiry of their visas. Illegal entrants in that description total well over 80,000, whereas the total unauthorised arrivals in Australia at the moment is well less than 1,000. So it is important not to get the unauthorised arrivals out of proportion in the debate. I repeat: it is the illegal entrants that, at least in volume, are far the more important problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, unauthorised arrivals have been subject to mandatory detention; most other illegals have not. I believe that that is an unjustified discrimination. I am pleased to see that the Migration Reform Act, which comes into effect on 1 September this year&mdash;its entry deferred from 1 November last year because of sloppy departmental and ministerial actions&mdash;will remove this discrimination. That is good: all illegals will be classified as illegal non-citizens, subject to detention. However, that leaves still the second question of whether the terms of release should be the same in both cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Reform Act provides for a bridging visa system for all those other than what we have to date called the unauthorised arrivals. The committee felt that there should be provision for the release of unauthorised arrivals, under certain conditions, after a six-month detention period because there was a unanimous view within the committee that prolonged periods of detention of boat people or other similar unauthorised arrivals is simply unacceptable in a civilised nation like Australia. So the committee has recommended that there be scope for release of detainees after six months, under certain conditions, and those are spelt out on page 156 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some people and some organisations will understandably feel that this recommendation is not sufficiently liberal. But I do ask them to have in mind when they are making their judgment that maintaining the integrity of our migration system is of paramount importance for many reasons, not the least of which is the need to maintain public confidence in that system, because if public confidence is lost then the whole of our migration program, including the refugee and humanitarian elements, is placed at grave risk. I accept and indeed subscribe to the committee's recommendations in this respect but I do draw attention, in particular, to paragraph 4.175 of the report on page 155, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is mindful that the RRT is an independent body charged with making deliberative decisions in its own right and, accordingly, is not subject to Government direction in the management of its case load. For this reason, the Committee has not included reference to the RRT in the above conclusion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the release conditions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises that its conclusion is based on the expectation that an efficient RRT review process will provide fair and expeditious decision making. If the RRT review process fails to meet this expectation, this would need to be addressed by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that as an important recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that arises is the extent to which unauthorised arrivals or any other illegal immigrants should have access to Australia's judicial system to appeal their claims to stay in Australia. I believe, for reasons that are spelt out in the report, that access is far too liberal at the moment. The Migration Reform Act does make certain provisions to restrict access to the courts. The report makes further recommendations to further do that. We have also drawn attention to the fact&mdash;and it is a specific recommendation, No. 6, in the report&mdash;that if those things do not result in a very significant reduction in appeals through the judicial system, the matter needs to be looked at again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very efficient administrative appeals system in Australia that ought to be taking precedence. I commend the report to the Senate and to the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in paying tribute to the chairmanship of Senator McKiernan and the deputy chairmanship of Senator Short, and to congratulate the committee on the great work it has done. I have added an addendum to the committee's report, and that deals with the capacity of judges to release people from custody in the appropriate circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view the courts are absolutely fundamental to the sort of society in which we live. We are a great democracy, a very great and tolerant country, and one that can justifiably pride itself on the way it treats everybody within its borders. Much of that character comes from the capacity of the courts to deliver people from imprisonment in appropriate circumstances. That is a long and a traditional role played by the courts over many generations in Australia, and prior to that, over many centuries in the United Kingdom, from which we draw our legal traditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was so in the great cases that dealt with slavery. There was the case of James Somerset, a black person from Africa. He had been taken as a slave to Virginia and then to England, and he remained there for two or three years. When his master wanted to take him back to Virginia, a writ of habeas corpus was taken out on his behalf, and the courts held that that writ was available to a person, no matter how low his social status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Somerset's case typifies what we should be about in this country, and that is giving the courts a capacity to deliver people from an imprisonment or from a custody that is not, in the circumstances, correct. As I said in my addendum, it is quite right and proper that the executive itself should have rules according to which people might be released from custody. But it troubles me that the power to deliver a person from executive custody should be confined to the executive. The very statement of that indicates the problem&mdash;that the person who holds somebody else in custody should not be the only one who delivers that person from custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have a great legal system. We have great judges; we have judges who do have the capacity to take into account the public interest at the same time as taking into account the particular circumstances of a person. In my view, judges have the capacity to measure the public interest in preserving, as Senator Short has so ably put it, the integrity of the system of immigration into Australia. At the same time, the courts can balance against that the public interest that nobody should be confined unjustly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraph 4.181 the committee deals with tests that could be applied in deciding whether or not a person should be released from detention after six months. One test is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether the applicant has a special need based on age, health, or previous experiences of torture and trauma.</PARA>
<PARA>If a person has that experience, that is an appropriate matter to take into account. If a person has suffered trauma overseas it may well be that that person should be released as a matter of urgency much earlier than six months, and it is proper that the judges should have the power to do so. The addendum really is an expression of my absolute faith in the judicial system, my absolute trust in the division of powers, and my absolute faith that if we do give the courts the power they traditionally have had, then that process will not threaten the overall integrity of the immigration system but will ensure that those people who are in need of release are properly released. </PARA>

I also acknowledge the many hours of discussion put in by the deputy chairman and the committee members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must express my extreme disappointment at the majority report presented here. As I explained in my dissenting report, there is no need for the continuation of mandatory detention that is at the basis of this majority report. This is the most inhumane and unjust of policies, not to mention being extremely costly and ineffective in terms of its purported aims. I looked in vain for evidence to support the continuation of mandatory detention&mdash;for perpetuating the disgraceful situation where most of the boat people currently in gaol have been held for more than a year. Some have been held for four years for the so-called crime of coming to Australia without a valid visa. We do not even treat major criminals this harshly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report blithely notes the length of detention that some boat people have had to undergo but seems to imply that much of the blame for this lies with the legal appeals that have been lodged by detainees. This smacks of a `blame the victim' mentality. If the law is being applied in such a slipshod or discriminatory manner by the departments that a legal case is recognised by the courts, why should not detainees utilise the courts? This is the course available to Australians who perceive themselves to be wronged. When the alternative may be the return to a country where people may face punishment or discrimination, then of course such people are going to make all possible efforts to make sure their cases have been properly considered, and if we regard ourselves as a free country that is right and proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This `blame the victim' feeling of many of the report's conclusions perhaps explains why the majority report gives so little attention to the psychological impacts of prolonged detention. There is no shortage of evidence as to the effect of prolonged detention on individuals and families, and these effects can occur no matter how good the detention facility or how robust the individual. Long-term detention is deleterious to everybody, with detainees suffering from boredom, frustration and anxiety, and feeling depressed and tense. There have been suicide attempts and the effects on children are particularly worrying, as the Red Cross and the New South Wales Child Protection Council testified before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report is also somewhat vague concerning the cost of Australia's detention system. As an overview, detention costs for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs totalled $18.43 million in 1992-93 alone, and this figure does not include the costs of legal assistance. The per person, per day costs are similarly of concern, especially when it appears that there are less expensive alternatives available, as I will discuss shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report justifies its recommendation to continue mandatory detention by noting how processing and review times for refugee applications have fallen considerably since 1990 and 1991. I find this illogical. One does not tolerate poor policy in the hope that its injustice and impracticalities will never become apparent. Moreover, the arbitrariness of the detention means that Australia will still be in breach of its international conventions. If the rest of the committee was so sure of the speed and fairness of administrative procedures for asylum seekers, why was it so adamant as to mandatory detention? Furthermore, why was it so mean-spirited in terms of the restrictions on when and who could be considered for release?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mean-spiritedness is clearly evident in a number of respects.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the minister is requested to consider release only where the period of detention exceeds six months and the delay is due to lack of action on the part of the department. Six months is a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the class of detainees to be considered for release if this stage is reached appears to be additionally restricted by the majority report to those who fall into specified categories, such as age or health related need. One can easily argue that the psychological effects of detention for this length of time can be debilitating for anyone, not just the aged, infirm or children. The impact on children of six months detention is incalculable. The third act of mean-spiritedness&mdash;this is also reflected in several majority report recommendations&mdash;is that it seeks to restrict the legal bases on which immigration decisions can be appealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last point brings me to the political double-speak in the majority report, also referred to by Senator Short, parroting that of the government in describing the Migration Reform Act as eliminating the distinction between the asylum seekers who arrive without documentation and those who apply for asylum after having entered Australia. Why is this a sleight of hand? While it is technically true and stated in the act that all illegal entrants will be subject to mandatory detention, in practice only boat people will be detained. The thousands of illegal entrants already in the community will continue to be allowed to remain in the community while their claims for refugee status are reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. If the federal government has decided that documented arrivals who overstay their visas do not pose any threat to the maintenance of Australia's immigration system by being conditionally released into the community, it is extremely difficult to see why it is not the same with unauthorised border arrivals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report appears to ignore this state of affairs and gloss over it, and regards almost any litigation by asylum seekers as unjustified. More seriously, the majority report recommends a substantial reduction in access to the judicial system. This situation is much more dangerous than the political double-speak occurring with the supposed elimination of the visa-no visa distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the limiting of grounds for judicial review of the Migration Act decisions is such as to be possibly against international conventions. Australians would be horrified if they could not challenge administrative decisions on the basis of breach of the rules of natural justice, lack of evidence, unreasonableness or bad faith. Many of these grounds are part of our legal heritage and the exclusion of non-citizens from similar access to judicial review of administrative decisions on these grounds is extremely discriminatory and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Commissioner has submitted that Australia is currently in breach of several international conventions because of our system of detention. As there is currently no provision which allows the individual circumstances of detention of border claimants to be taken into account, Australia is in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia's long-term detention of children also means that we are clearly violating the Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the conventions on the rights of the child. I would submit that the recommendations of the majority report, if implemented, would only increase the likelihood that Australia is breaching international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this injustice, this expense and this breach of international conventions is totally unnecessary. There are alternatives available which actually achieve the objectives that are claimed for the practice of detention. The basis of the alternative is a conditional release to be made available to all unauthorised border arrivals claiming refugee status once preliminary identity, security and health checks have been completed. The basic thrust of a conditional release scheme would be to release relevant detainees into the community under specific conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community groups and their resources would be utilised in a cooperative approach to provide such releasees with accommodation, material goods, transport, education, health and counselling that are adequate for their basic needs. The federal government would provide funds for most of these services, although community organisations may be able to provide some from their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particular emphasis on early release should be given to vulnerable individuals such as children, the elderly, the infirm and those who have been victims of trauma or torture, since they are likely to be particularly affected by detention. To say that their detention is mandatory for the first six months prior to these conditions allowing their release on a bridging visa is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as being more appropriate for the level of the offence that has been committed&mdash;that is, entering without a visa&mdash;a community based scheme also has considerable potential for savings compared with mandatory detention. I emphasise the fact that if the sleight of hand or the double-speak that says all illegal entrants will be detained is actually true, the enormous blow-out in the budget will defy our imagination. </PARA>

I think it is worth placing on record the fact that both Senator McKiernan, who has spoken in this debate from the government side of the chamber, and Senator Short from the opposition have curtailed their remarks because of the 10-minute time limit that is applied to honourable senators speaking on the tabling and consideration of committee reports, which, as honourable senators would know, has a time limit of one hour. In the circumstances when a misunderstanding like this occurs I think it is appropriate to be as flexible and reasonable as we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would propose one of two courses of action: that we agree to leave being granted to Senator Chamarette to speak for a further five minutes or, alternatively, I would certainly agree to leave for Senator Chamarette to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> any further remarks that she may have. If Senator Chamarette wishes to utilise either of those options I believe that is appropriate in this circumstance, but I think the Senate should be aware that other senators have had, as a result of this situation, to curtail their remarks. </PARA>

At a whips meeting, at which all parties were represented, it was agreed that there was half an hour for each speaker and for as many speakers as required to speak to the report. Consequently, a rather longer than 10-minute speech was prepared. I did not intend to read it; I intended to speak to it. However, when I was informed of the curtailment of time, I read the speech to expedite the content for it to be available on the public record.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue that arises is the extent to which unauthorised arrivals&mdash;or any other illegal immigrants&mdash;should have access to Australia's judicial system to appeal their claims to stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be recognised that, since 1992, the fundamental reason for continued detention of the unauthorised arrivals is that they have chosen to appeal through our judicial system against the double rejection by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and by an appellate review body, of their applications to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is almost alone in allowing such unrestricted access to our courts in addition to the two tier administrative review system we have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This increasing resort to judicial review in recent years is in my view undesirable. It cannot be totally eliminated, whether we like it or not, because our Federal Constitution guarantees right of access to the High Court. However, I believe, as did the majority of the Committee, that steps should be taken to severely curtail the access to our Judicial system to appeal against decisions which have been given after the most careful and objective consideration and review at the administrative level. No less than 60-65 percent of all the ADJR Act cases before the Federal Court relate to the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Reform Act has introduced changes which should go some way to meeting this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report makes recommendations to further restrict appeal access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not certain that this will be sufficient. So the Committee made a further recommendation, recommendation 6 on page 104, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . if the amendments in the Migration Reform Act 1992 and the proposals in this report aimed at curtailing the recent trend to litigate migration decisions in the higher courts are not successful, consideration be given to implementing a new refugee determination process which would provide refugee claimants with access only to the two tier administrative process, and which would close off access to review and appeal in the higher courts, save for the right of access to the High Court which is guaranteed in the Australian Constitution. . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report deals with a very difficult and sensitive subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of maintaining the integrity of our migration system surely cannot be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be recognised&mdash;with pride&mdash;that Australia has an unparalleled record for its granting of refugee status to people fleeing from persecution in other countries. We have given refuge to half a million people since 1945. That makes Australia the third largest recipient of refugees in absolute terms, and the first on a per capita basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the Report encompasses all these many considerations in a balanced way, and I commend it to the Senate and to the Australian public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will read the minority report because alternative views have been expressed. I was talking about the costs of the program and of the savings of an alternative. I now want to talk about the success rate of that. The evidence from existing release schemes indicates that there is likely to be quite a good success rate in terms of adherence to release conditions. Safeguards for release would build upon the experience gained from the system that currently operates for illegal immigrants. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs would still retain some responsibility for those released. The department would also coordinate the program and provide the necessary resources to appropriate community groups to ensure that an adequate scheme is established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Replacing mandatory detention with a conditional release scheme is basically the application of a risk benefit approach. Of course, some unauthorised border arrivals may abscond on a conditional release scheme, just as do some illegal entrants and some citizens on bail. However, these numbers can be minimised by the use of safeguards and incentives. It should not be forgotten that what is being offered is no more than what is offered to Australian citizens, who are invariably able to apply for release when the type of offence involves a relatively minor level of criminality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the government could save considerable amounts in terms of costs spent on unauthorised border arrivals. More discussion and analysis on the details of the conditional release scheme that I propose would be necessary before implementation by the federal government. However, I believe that the evidence supports the view that such a scheme would not only deal with unauthorised border arrivals in a more humane manner, it would also be more effective in a risk management and a cost sense than the process currently in existence or proposed in the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to the extent that one of the reasons for the federal government's mandatory detention is deterrence, it should be noted that the number of unauthorised border arrivals is likely to vary more with events in overseas countries than with the harshness of Australia's detention policies. In addition, small sums spent in helping refugees at overseas locations may be considerably more effective than the large sums spent on detention in Australia. There appears to be an assumption, but no evidence, in the majority report that the conditional release of border claimants would see the control mechanism unravel. Consequently, an increase in expenditure on support of refugees overseas would be more useful than the continuation of mandatory detention if the government believed that additional measures to dissuade refugees from coming to Australia were necessary. Given the apparent cost of detention, providing resources to help  refugees overseas would undoubtedly be considerably more cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the practices of other countries, cost effectiveness, common justice and our obligations with respect to international conventions all point to the elimination of mandatory detention as a government policy and to maintaining current processes of judicial review. The majority report fulfils none of these criteria, which is why I disagree with most of its recommendations&mdash;almost all&mdash;and have provided a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations with which I can wholeheartedly concur, however, is that the processing of applications for refugee status from unauthorised border arrivals and persons held in detention must be given absolute precedence. This is particularly the case, given the existing situation of mandatory detention and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) refusing to exercise his discretion and release all long-term detainees. It is also necessary because of the extremely unsympathetic and restrictive nature of the majority report recommendations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to those individuals and organisations who put time and effort into making submissions and appearing before the committee. Their appeals were overwhelmingly to end our detention regime. I am deeply sorry that their views received so little recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some final comments concerning the overall inquiry process as played out in this report on detention practices. I believe that the conclusions in the report do not reflect independent analysis of the evidence presented to the committee, but rather reflect existing  prejudices of both the government and opposition parties with respect to boat people. These prejudices are evident in all discussions that occur in this place on migration, including those last year on the Migration Amendment Act and Migration Reform Act. I only wish that the changes that are recommended by the majority report did more than just seek to justify an inhumane and unjust policy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1993-94, appropriations totalling $2.0 million additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1993-94 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increases sought relate primarily to the replacement of information technology assets of the parliamentary library and the parliamentary reporting staff, and to fund increased facsimile usage in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1993-94</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these bills, parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1993-94 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional appropriations in these three bills total $710 million; $542.1 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $165.9 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $2.0 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1993-94; reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. The savings in the appropriations, amounting to $545.5 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document "Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations", which has been distributed to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $164.5 million in appropriations for 1993-94, an increase of 0.5 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1993-94 budget. This compares with the level of supplementation sought in 1992-93 of $1,185.6 million, an increase of 3.2 per cent on that year's budget appropriations, and is consistent with the downwards revision of outlays growth for 1993-94, as announced recently by the Treasurer. This lower growth in estimated outlays reflects the continuing strength of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the main areas for which the Government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1993-94 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from salary increases. $150.2 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies, including the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases; this represents an increase of 1.3 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). Other factors affecting running costs include transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gross additional estimates of $175.7 million are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$88.6 million for Defence Facilities, largely due to the payment of the Defence capital contribution for the Russell Offices redevelopment; higher than previously anticipated expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation in Sydney; and costs associated with the connection of sewerage systems at Holdsworthy/Moorebank; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$71.7 million for Defence Housing, reflecting advance rental payments to the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and an additional capital subvention for the DHA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increases have been offset by reductions elsewhere in the Defence appropriations, giving a net increase of some $139 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes provision for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an increase of $49.3 million for Labour Market Program assistance to Jobseekers and Industry, reflecting the Government's commitment to assist the long-term unemployed to return to work;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$42.1 million for child care fee relief, which reflects growth in average fee relief and in the number of private sector places;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$15.2 million for payment to Australian Hearing Services, mainly due to higher than anticipated demand following the extension of pensioner fringe benefits from 1 April 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">$14.6 million for the care of veterans in non-departmental institutions, reflecting increased patient numbers following the sale of the Repatriation General Hospital Hollywood in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of some $95 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional appropriations are required to meet undertakings made by the Government since the budget, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other economic parameter changes since the budget was prepared.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am continuing my remarks from yesterday on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993. To recap, this is an important debate, although the legislation which is the catalyst for the debate disguises that matter. It is a very simple piece of legislation which proposes a series of amendments to make the operation of the training guarantee administration simpler and to provide more flexibility in its implementation. However, when one looks at the range of speakers proposed by the opposition on this matter, it is quite apparent there are much bigger issues at stake than would be contained in this measure which has budgetary implications of about $2 million this year. What is at stake is essentially an ideological debate about the role of the state and the role of government in the provision of assistance to employers for training. It goes to the heart of basic philosophical attitudes about the way in which these measures should be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of speakers provided by the opposition clearly indicates it takes this matter very seriously. The remarks we have already heard by Senator Teague indicate that there is not much at stake in terms of the amendments themselves; it is the principle at the very heart of the bill that is causing concern to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, I have been arguing that reliance on the market to provide such basic measures as training of the Australian work force is a totally inadequate measure to provide the necessary skills for the development of a fully-rounded work force and to provide for a mature, developing economy. No clearer example of that can be provided than the fact that a report by the National Safety Council of Australia produced earlier this year indicated that Australian employers are endangering the lives of workers by failing to provide adequate training in the workplace. Up to 600 deaths and 500,000 injuries a year can be directly attributed to the failure of Australian employers and a failure of the market to provide adequate training. That clearly indicates the need for measures to ensure there is adequate provision by this country for workers and for the way in which employers provide training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been indicated is that the Australian economy is growing. As I said yesterday, there is an opportunity now for a better trained work force to participate in that economic recovery and prosperity. In my view, what the training guarantee levy has successfully done is to encourage a much greater compliance rate and a much greater responsibility by employers to meet their responsibilities to this country as a whole. The compliance rate of over 95 per cent is particularly significant. In 1989, a training expenditure survey by the government indicated that 58 per cent of businesses were spending nothing on training and 74 per cent were spending less than one per cent on training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many critics of the scheme indicated to the Senate committee hearings that a majority of businesses report that their training has been more effective since the training guarantee levy has been in operation. This legislation and these amendments are only part of a total package, however. This government is keen to ensure there is an ongoing commitment by industry to a more competitive approach to industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training of one's workers is a very important part of that. From the workers' point of view there is an essential responsibility to ensure that work satisfaction is improved by being able to participate more effectively in the work force and able to move more flexibly between employers to improve the employability of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those employers who bludge on other employers by not providing training are committing a great disservice, not just to this country, but to the industry in which they participate. It is not appropriate for employers to say, however, whenever there is a shortfall in skills, that the government has a responsibility to fill the gaps. That has been the tradition in this country. Whenever there is a shortfall in skills there are calls by employer groups to provide more immigrants. The old idea of planeloads of people arriving to fill gaps in the economy is totally inappropriate and inadequate for an advanced industrial country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government says it is important for all groups in the community to participate in economic development. The government provides all sorts of incentives to employers. Some $2.5 billion a year is provided in direct assistance to employers by governments in this country. It is up to employers to meet their share of the burden. It is not good enough for conservative employer groups, represented in this place by the Liberal Party, to say that the government should get out of encouraging employers to meet their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critics of this scheme who suggest the scheme is too bureaucratic and administratively too costly, in my judgment, will be demonstrated by the review process that is currently under way to be incorrect. To date, we have not seen the evidence to support those sorts of ideological claims by the dry-as-dust groups within politics in this country who suggest this scheme is somehow or other not working properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to clearly examine the evidence which suggests rorts are occurring and to understand precisely what is the political motivation of people who make such claims. What we heard during the Senate committee inquiry into this matter was that businessmen for some years have used the taxation system to their advantage. Nothing is likely to change quickly in that regard. Notwithstanding the fact that the evidence of the Tax Office is that there is very little abuse of the scheme, it is quite apparent some people will misuse any taxation schemes, just as it is quite apparent some employers will resist any attempt by the government to encourage a more socially responsible attitude in terms of the provision of training for workers, no matter what direct benefits they enjoy by participating in such schemes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that the Democrats support the amendments contained in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993. We agree with their purpose, which is to make the scheme slightly more flexible. Senator Carr provided an accurate description of the effect of the amendments. I referred this bill to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. During that inquiry we were told in further detail what the effect of the amendments would be. As such, the Democrats support the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also told during that inquiry that the Department of Employment, Education and Training was conducting a review of the training guarantee scheme. Some aspects of that review were revealed to the committee, but I am still unclear about what the review can achieve in the long term while the government maintains the philosophy of compulsion rather than encouragement. No matter which way one looks at this scheme, it is a scheme which emphasises compliance and compulsion rather than looking at ways of encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the scheme is that if an employer is obliged, by qualifying under the scheme by crossing the threshold of payroll level, to spend a certain amount of money on training, but does not do so, a penalty will be imposed&mdash;a levy will be applied compulsorily. I support the concept of using training to increase productivity, but I believe we ought to be looking at many more ways of encouraging that to happen rather than by the application of this compulsory levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of outstanding trainers is contained within the concept of this legislation, but we have heard little about it. There has been very little publicity regarding outstanding trainers and the practices they follow. We have seen very little attempt to establish such enterprises as models for other businesses to follow. That, to me, would emphasise the encouragement aspect rather than the penalty aspect. There is quite a deal of confusion about what legitimate training is. Senator Carr mentioned the myth of rorts. I agree with him. In some ways we have a tradition whereby there are certain taxpayers who will always find a way to avoid it, and a way of using loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be much more emphasis on what is legitimate training so we can establish that as a model to be followed. Those who are in business to make a dollar are not there for the prime purpose of discovering loopholes but to conduct a successful enterprise. One would hope that that is the case. If those who want to encourage legitimate training emphasise what qualifies for it, we would have more success. Such an approach has the potential to positively affect all enterprises in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the Senate of what we were told at the committee of inquiry by Senator Schacht, who was the minister presenting evidence at the time. He reminded the committee that there are approximately 800,000 small businesses in Australia. We were also told that only some 70,000 of those businesses were required to meet the training guarantee levy; that is, only some 70,000 qualified by dint of being within the threshold of the payroll level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, only approximately 500 small businesses did not meet that requirement for training&mdash;only 500 out of 800,000&mdash;and therefore had to pay. It is fairly strange that any business at all should be in that category because the present legislation provides that an enterprise can remove its obligation to pay a levy by making an equal donation to certain educational institutions, and such a donation is a taxable deduction whereas the levy is not. I am amazed that anybody would be so ignorant as to leave himself liable for that levy when the simple way out would be to make a deductible donation to an educational institution. I am amazed that any enterprise would allow itself to be saddled with the levy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past three years that relatively small number of small businesses&mdash;some 500 out of 800,000&mdash;have paid approximately $6 million. That amount is much lower than the government has spent promoting and administering the scheme. I understand that the purpose of the scheme is not to raise sufficient administrative funds through levies to pay for itself. That is not the point of the scheme, and I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making is that it is an unwieldy scheme; it is not an easily administered scheme. Admittedly&mdash;and those who speak on its behalf admit to this&mdash;it is a broad brush scheme that is not targeted. It is even difficult to determine whether it achieves its own goal of increasing spending on useful training.   Contained  within  the  act  at  the</PARA>
<PARA>moment there are not the tools to make that determination easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that enlightened managers were already spending on the training that this scheme requires anyway, and that they were already reaping the consequent benefits of increased productivity. We all know that there were unenlightened managers who may have been compelled by this scheme to spend on training. But the clumsiness of this scheme does not easily allow for determination of whether that spending has been on worthwhile training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr rightly expressed his concern that several hundred workers had died through lack of proper induction and training in correct workplace safety procedures. I share his concern, as I hope all honourable senators would. I refer to the speech given by Mrs Silvia Smith, the honourable member for Bass in the other place, on 3 February when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU's national occupational health and safety coordinator, Ms Renata Musolino, said employers needed to ensure that workplaces were as safe as possible and that workers are properly trained to manage potential danger.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Smith said that Ms Musolino said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly there are going to be industries where you can't eliminate hazards and where you have to work with hazardous chemicals or to work with electricity or you have to work suspended in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You make sure that you've done everything you can to make the actual work environment as safe as possible and you train your workers. Where employers are falling down, I believe, is in both these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most employers provided adequate training but many companies, particularly small businesses, neglected their responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>That was Mrs Smith quoting the ACTU's national occupational health and safety coordinator. But this scheme does nothing to ensure that those obligations are met. This scheme does not target them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, there are some 730,000 small businesses which are not obliged to do anything under this scheme. The scheme is not targeted; it does not even affect a huge majority of small businesses in Australia. In an associated vein, again quoting from Mrs Smith's speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training guarantee slots straight in with the concept of the level playing field. It also means that the good corporate citizens who train their employees do not have their staff poached by corporate parasites who do not train. This is achieved by the blanket requirements of the training guarantee. All organisations with a payroll over the threshold must train their staff.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very noble, but 730,000 small businesses are not caught and are therefore not prevented from poaching from enlightened enterprises that provide well directed training for their employees. Senator Carr is absolutely right: adequate training is not being provided in safety and workplace practices. This scheme does not deliver it. The free market cannot be relied upon to deliver it either; in fact, I would suggest that the free market would do almost the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme needs considerable alteration before it can be declared successful in its own stated goals and achievements. I agree with previous speakers who commented about the fact that this scheme introduces a penalty of record keeping and extra administrative mumbo jumbo to be gone through just to employ people. The refinements required are considerable. In fact, when really considered carefully, this is a scheme that encourages quantity, not quality; the capacity to improve productivity is not correctly addressed; and there is no easy method of determining whether this scheme is actually delivering that which it purports to deliver. The best we can do at the moment is to agree with the amendments that we have in front of us. In fact, the first two amendments proposed by Senator Teague achieve an extension of that flexibility and, because of what they do, will be supported by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going a fraction of the way but, as far as we are concerned, the key emphasis in the future should be on encouragement rather than compulsion. When Senator Carr talks about the opposing philosophies in this debate, I would like to add a third aspect: there is not only a need for recognition that training is necessary and must be provided; we should also look at the means of compelling that event to take place. As I have said before, in this scheme there has been too much stick and not enough carrot. In the review that DEET will conduct I will be looking for alternatives such as the emphasis on outstanding trainers and establishing models of good practice and enterprise leading to increased productivity and increased safety in the workplace. I will be looking for those emphases in the DEET review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we need to look at improving this scheme. Therefore, the Democrats will be supporting the first two amendments proposed by Senator Teague and will be carefully monitoring the evaluation process which DEET itself is now conducting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it this morning the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1993, which will amend the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990. The principal act put into place the training guarantee scheme which, at the present time, requires employers with an annual payroll greater than $226,000 to spend at least 1.5 per cent of their payroll on eligible training. Employers who do not spend the specified amount must pay a training levy. In a sense, because it is not tax deductible, the levy is a fine or penalty imposed on employers. The defaulting employer who fails to meet the training requirement and spend the required amount of money is thereby penalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the amendments will implement two of the government's promises that were made in the 1993 election lead-up: the carrying forward of excess expenditure and the treatment of training subsidies. Those honourable senators who were here at the time may recall that, when debating the original legislation in 1990, I alerted the Senate to the insufficiency of it in relation to the carry forward element. I repeat today what I said then: the inability was inequitable and contrary to normal taxation principles and taxation law and practice. What is surprising though is that it has taken this government nearly four years to act and to correct this anomaly. That is a shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the legislation include: the carrying forward of the training guarantee shortfall; the doubling of the minimum allowable apprentice or trainee amount; removal of the age restriction on student work experience; changes to grouping arrangements; and the definition of eligible training expenditure. Other provisions deal with liquidators. I have no problem with the general thrust of the amendments because they increase, although in a very limited way, the flexibility of the scheme. Commendable as the objectives of the training guarantee scheme are&mdash;the raising of the national training effort and increasing business awareness of the importance of training&mdash;the scheme is an administrative nightmare and a great disincentive to employment. From its very beginning the whole scheme was flawed, and it continues to be flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the scheme was introduced in 1990, I raised these existing problems before the scheme actually began.

For example, the Australian National Audit Office report indicated that the scheme does not suit the management style of many companies and industries, nor does it lend itself easily to program evaluation or the development of performance indicators. In addition to the coalition's criticisms of the mechanics of the scheme, we believe the scheme is dominated by problems such as high costs of administration. Let us look at those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACCI believes that the training guarantee levy has failed in its purpose, has increased administrative overhead costs for business, has been a disincentive to employment and should be abandoned or substantially overhauled. It also argues that the scheme is designed to suit the needs of the Australian Taxation Office rather than the requirements of business. That is an interesting point. The administrative problems go further than just the extra cost; they extend the extra time required to meet and to administer the scheme's onerous requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what about the scheme's impact on small business? Small businesses have problems complying with the scheme. They find it difficult to construct appropriate training programs for all their employees so they quite frequently select only a group of people to train. One of the other problems is that, because of the difficulties that small business face, the training levy is often spent by the principals in going to assorted conventions. There is a bias in that there is a tendency under the scheme for senior staff to be trained at the expense of the unskilled ranks. Small businesses rarely have the in-house resources to comply with the scheme and must seek external assistance, naturally at an extra cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to avoid paying the levy, such employers may use the exemption available to payments made to certain organisations, such as universities.

While the amendment permitting a shortfall to be carried forward is a step in the right direction and one that I signalled in 1990-91, I query why a shortfall cannot be carried forward for more than one year. Why is it not three years? An extension greater than just the one year would allow business to adequately plan its training program to take into account new staffing requirements as and when they may emerge. It is prescriptively too short a period in terms of what is allowed. Again, there is not enough flexibility, even in this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned also that the carry forward provisions relating to the excess expenditure are not available to employers that have elected to form a group. The explanatory memorandum for this is that for technical reasons it is too vague. Perhaps Senator Sherry should direct his mind to answering the question as to the technical reasons.

A number of points mentioned in today's debate are quite true. It is possible for companies, and especially small business, to avoid their actual training contribution by the executives attending expensive conferences and seminars. I have seen a $2,000 for two days conference, especially at the time when there was one year for that money to be spent without there having to be some kind of penalty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the same token, extending the scheme a further year, as the coalition is suggesting, may create problems in the other direction. I am not suggesting that the majority of companies were involved in avoiding paying their contribution, but I am concerned if the scheme can be averaged over three years then some, especially young workers in a particular industry whose payroll exceeds the minimum payroll requirement for the training guarantee to be required to be spent, may fall through the gaps. Two years may be the means by which people who are working in a particular business may not receive any reasonable training outcome because their employer has managed to avoid any particular expenditure on useful training for over two years. </PARA>

It is especially so in those kind of service industries where there is a one-to-one client and craftsperson worker relationship such as electricians and plumbers.

This creates all sorts of funny training programs, which I will return to later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the very broad brush approach of this legislation does not take into account&mdash;this is probably its most serious flaw&mdash;is the profitability of a business. Highly profitable businesses can obviously roll with a charge like this, but very marginal businesses&mdash;particularly since this legislation came in, and with the depths of the great recession&mdash;increasingly have been forced to the wall by a whole range of inappropriate government charges and procedures. When those very marginal operations have a 1 1/2 per cent impost added&mdash;which is really another tax if they cannot spend the money on training in an effective way&mdash;they often go under, and I will return to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many arguments for abolishing this bill and, in this amendment before us today, we have a bandaid job. The government realises that this legislation is seriously flawed in many ways, but rather than bite the bullet and do what is required, it is putting to us that it has identified a number of these problems, and that it will take this bandaid approach and change it a bit here and a bit there and hope it will come up with a better scheme that businesses find more acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But businesses will not find it acceptable for the reasons I outlined at the start of my speech. It puts an additional cost on business. In this modern era of enterprise bargaining, it is totally inappropriate. Training really should be part of a total deal in a true enterprise bargaining package that would look, not at training in isolation, but at all aspects of the way work practices operate in a business. There could be certain trade-offs in a business which would mean that staff in highly technical areas would get a lot more training than staff in less technical areas, but there might be some other benefit in a true enterprise system for those less technical areas. This one rule for all business cuts completely across that and is another reason why it should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the way that some businesses go about increasing their training component there are some very ineffective types of training taking place. One of the greatest criticisms of this scheme is that it often has a high recreational component as businesses struggle to make up this 1 1/2 per cent, and this has led to a lot of rorts in the system. It was highlighted in my own city of Newcastle recently when a training group was discovered to be rorting the system considerably&mdash;for example, the group was going to Thailand to have conferences to solve some of the problems of the business. When questioned on this by a more honest member of staff, the head of the business said, `We can get away from the phones'. This particular rort was exposed and the people are being dealt with and charged. But it is the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the conference brochures that are around to see the locations, the types of activity and the costs to see how much rorting is going on. I personally resent it. Apart from being a taxpayer, I am a conference attendee. There are many conferences I would like to go to. As senators, brochures come through to us on all sorts of things. Occasionally I look at one and say, `That would be good. I would like to know a bit more about that, and go to that two-day conference'. Then I see that a conference that five years ago cost me $100 to attend now costs $1,800, and many luxury weekend resorts soak up the money in the training guarantee levy. It is a distortion of training money. This country needs much more and much better training. It makes me very angry that the money is wasted in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training was so concerned after the training guarantee levy legislation was passed that it set up an inquiry and has been monitoring its development. Indeed, this legislation before us today was referred to the committee for its consideration. A number of witnesses appeared before us, and what they had to say was particularly revealing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET was there putting its usual little blocking pieces for the government and telling us that this was just very necessary finetuning. It is interesting to see that DEET will have a full report out on this legislation in October of this year. It should then come back into the parliament with our report and we should consider where we go from that point. If the government does a fair and honest assessment of this scheme I believe it will come to the conclusion that the scheme should be totally wound up, and that, in our amendment, with a sunset clause, is exactly what we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other people came before the committee, including Professor Noble from Charles Sturt University. He had done some research into training guarantees across Australia. He found that the average firm spends 2 1/2 per cent of its payroll in this area. He said that we should look at better training alternatives to the training guarantee levy. Indeed, returning to Professor Noble's former point, a lot of those firms which found they were spending more than the 1 1/2 per cent actually cut back their training because they thought, `We won't get the best tax benefit out of our training unless we come back to that 1 1/2 per cent'. So, in some instances, it has actually reduced training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gaite and Beresford from the University of South Australia have also done some research on the training guarantee levy. They appeared before the committee and said that this scheme really had little effect on business expenditure and that there was very little incentive to engage in further training. However, they pointed out&mdash;and I think this is one of the vital reasons this should be scrapped&mdash;that the training guarantee levy adds very high administrative costs and a record-keeping burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked a number of firms to provide me with the details on that, and not just on the training guarantee levy but on the extent to which government paperwork right across the board adds to their business costs and, more importantly, adds to the time that they have to spend going through government hoops rather than making money out there in the real world. I have made that request over a number of years to quite a number of small businesses. They have all said, `Yes', I will do it.', but no-one has got back to me yet and I suspect the reason is that they are so busy completing government paperwork that they do not have time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At our hearing we heard from one firm which gave us its experience of the training guarantee levy. That was Coles Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Pty Ltd from Broadmeadow in my own city of Newcastle. That company has been in business for 38 years and employs 30 to 40 staff. The training guarantee levy did not increase in any way that company's amount of training. But, to highlight the point I made earlier, what it did do to Coles Refrigeration was add 100 hours of paperwork per year in documentation, filling in forms and jumping through government hoops. Multiplied across the nation, this means that this particular piece of legislation has a large impact on business costs, and is another reason it should be scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from our committee, other bodies have had a look at this scheme. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted a survey, which concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Training Guarantee survives today as a nuisance imposition on the costs of running a business and on the structure of training at the enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA>What a damning indictment. This statement comes after a survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry which covers businesses that are the main subject of this piece of legislation. It just shows how much this government is not listening. It blindly follows ideological principle and it seems it is not capable, even when we have a piece of legislation like this before us, of fine tuning it to the needs of business and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office found that 63 per cent of firms spent the same amount or less than before the introduction of the training guarantee levy, and 70 per cent reported more administrative work. This piece of legislation is fundamentally flawed. It is not working. It does not cover the 93 per cent of businesses under the threshold. A few minor amendments, as proposed in this legislation, will not fix up the fundamental flaws of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government is not prepared to listen, I urge the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the independent member, Senator Harradine, to support in particular the opposition amendment which puts a sunset clause on this bill of June this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can lead an animal to water but cannot make it drink. This government believes in the directive. It has shown that in all sorts of policy areas. In the area of training, the government is basically saying that it believes it knows how businesses should be run. The government believes it should tell a business that it should spend 1 1/2 per cent of its payroll on training its people, and the government has put a levy on all businesses above that $220,000 threshold to enforce this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that governments cannot run businesses efficiently. That is why all governments around the world are now getting rid of their businesses. That is what the privatisation thrust is all about, so that government businesses are pushed out into the private sector to let the owners, managers and employees work efficiently in trying to compete. In properly run businesses, the owners, managers and employees all recognise the need for proper training, otherwise the businesses do not survive. They do not need a government directive to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is arrogant nonsense to suggest that government ministers know what is best for each business. It is again arrogant nonsense to suggest that government can prescribe the level of training needed for each business, even for the 45,000 businesses which are affected by this legislation. What the government can do and should do is encourage firms to be internationally competitive, and then leave it to the businesses to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International competition forces owners, managers and employees to perform to the best of their ability in order to make the enterprise succeed. If they do not do this, they know there is failure. In a competitive environment businesses know that they have to have a cooperative and effective work force, with appropriate education and training, and the training has to be continuous but at the appropriate level. As my colleague Senator Tierney said, it is horses for courses&mdash;a lot of training is required in some jobs and very little in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training is best done on the job, and the amount and cost varies enormously. Let us consider the differences between the additional training that can be given to an experienced bulldozer operator and the training that is required almost continuously for the operators of a sophisticated, electronically controlled plant. The differences are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not being critical of the need for training, quite the contrary. I believe very firmly that training is an absolutely essential ingredient for successful business. I have had personal experience of that, having managed businesses and been a director of several businesses. In each of the businesses I have been involved in we have put an enormous amount into training&mdash;in fact, training expenditure commonly was of the order of between 3 per cent and 6 per cent of payroll; and that is necessary. But the judgment is made: what do we need to do to make this business efficient and make it compete with the rest of the world? If we are competing against the best people in the world, we have to train and do it well. I agree with Senator Bell's comments that encouragement and not compulsion is required in the training area. So the government is heading in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has added significant business costs and, in particular, administrative costs. This is because of the requirement of the scheme for all training expenditures to be recorded separately from those incurred in the normal course of business. As two of my colleagues have mentioned, since its introduction the current scheme has been the subject of significant rorts, which by themselves make the administration and structure of the scheme a laughing stock within the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had numerous examples quoted to us over the years about junkets to seminars and overseas travel which are totally unrelated to industry training. The many flaws in the scheme have been highlighted by the recent survey undertaken by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There is no need to go into the details because they have been mentioned in previous speeches; but virtually all the employer organisations have criticised the scheme&mdash;and all have recommended that it be wound down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chamber of Commerce and Industry report pointed to the fact that the scheme involved considerable administrative costs, and that the administration was apparently designed to suit the needs of the Australian Taxation Office rather than the requirements of business. In its first report on the compliance with the levy in 1990-91, the Australian Taxation Office was not able to conclude with any certainty whether the scheme was actually working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to private research conducted for the ATO, about 70 per cent of employers were meeting their training obligations under the legislation, `merely by putting together structured documentation for their existing in-house programs'. Again, I reiterate that all the major employer organisations in Australia have recommended the scrapping of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even government bodies as diverse as the Australian National Audit Office and the government's EPAC&mdash;the Economic Planning Advisory Council&mdash;have expressed doubt as to the practicality of the scheme. The ANAO report expressed concern that the scheme did not lend itself easily to program evaluation or to the development of performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office also found a degree of concern amongst employers and industry groups about the administrative costs of compliance with the scheme, and the fact that it has resulted in the imposition of increased structure and documentation in the management of existing programs. The EPAC report criticised the scheme for approving training programs with a high recreational component.The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long run it would be desirable to move away from the blunt instrument of compulsion and penalties. </PARA>
<PARA>What we require is encouragement&mdash;not the blunt instrument of compulsion and penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of my colleagues mentioned earlier, in August last year the then minister for employment, Mr Beazley, referred to the scheme and was reported as saying, `it probably should go'. The government's own recent task force on regional development, chaired by ACTU Secretary Kelty who is, after all, the power behind the emperor's throne, has actually recommended that the scheme be suspended for three years. According to the findings of the task force, the scheme has not been fully understood by industry, and is seen as an administrative burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real need is to encourage businesses to be internationally competitive, and then leave them to get on with the job. Owners, managers and all the employees, if they are facing up to international competition, will recognise the need to do the training. The employees themselves will demand the training so that the businesses will succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments introduced in the bill attempt to increase the degree of flexibility in the scheme by allowing firms to carry forward excess expenditure from one year to the next. The amendments are simply tinkerings around the edge of the system which has outlived its usefulness, and is now simply a bureaucratic burden on Australian business.

This amendment relates to an act which requires employers with a payroll over a specified level to spend a minimum amount on training. Of all the silly decisions of this government, perhaps the silliest was the training guarantee levy. It would have to have been dreamt up by some ivory tower boffins with no knowledge or understanding of the requirements of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy was sold to a Labor government equally bereft of business experience by those people whom ex-Senator Walsh would call the `chattering classes'. Over the years I have worked in manufacturing, mining and service industries. This has meant working with people at all levels, from tradesmen and unskilled labourers to professional engineers and so on. At no stage have I seen a situation where suitable staff could not be obtained, in the main from within Australia, but in odd specialised instances, from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did hear Senator Carr talking about employers bludging off other employers by pirating people from other companies. That practice occurred in days of full employment particularly, and still goes on today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been times when companies have pirated staff from academia and the public sector. I have heard complaints over the years where people say, `We have trained these people in academia or the public sector, and someone comes along and pinches them'. That will not be stopped. That is why I said we have this mad, chattering class that convinced this government to go down the track of imposing a penalty and forcing employers to train people when they do not need to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about employment, we must acknowledge that the problem has always been the availability of people prepared to work in certain sectors of the economy. That happens even today for reasons which predominantly relate to the welfare system. What the training levy has done is to build up a whole new industry of so-called experts who are earning a living at the expense of the wealth creating sector and who spend the money, whether they need to or not, rather than hand it over to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was unwittingly involved in this a few years ago&mdash;and I see Senator McMullan looking with raised eyebrows; he may have even done it too&mdash;when I was asked to give talks at these training programs. Professional people who are involved in training and who have developed it into an industry, get you to go along there. They do not care whether 20, 30 or a 100 people turn up, because they charge a fairly hefty fee. In some instances I suspect a lot of people register for those courses and do not turn up, but have fulfilled their obligation under the training guarantee levy. </PARA>

Senator Bell is nodding; he has seen it; he may well have given a speech, too, and not been paid for it. That is what is going on. When there is bad legislation such as this it is inevitable that this sort of thing will happen. Senator Carr talked earlier about people abusing the system. Of course they will abuse the system. The worse the legislation the more the system will be abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those who prefer to hand the equivalent of the training levy over to educational institutions rather than engage in silly but acceptable programs which only serve to reduce the productivity of the companies themselves. Senator Bell mentioned that of 70,000 people in the small business sector who are required to participate in the training guarantee levy, 500 pay the fine&mdash;which it is&mdash;to the government. He was surprised the figure was that high. I am also surprised it is that high because any accountant would normally advise those people on ways to get around it. I say that quite deservedly: ways to get around it. They do not want to do it but here we have this heavy hand of government that says they must spend 1 1/2 per cent or whatever it is of their total payroll on training people whether they need to train them or not. If there is anything more stupid than that, I would like to know what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems in this place is that people tend to keep myths alive and the great myth is that these things are all very good and they are doing great things for the country.

They had a few good barbecues, they played a bit of golf and they were lectured on stress. No-one took it seriously except one person. He decided that he had never been stressed before but he was now, having listened to the lecture, and he insisted on taking a 10-minute walk every hour to relieve that stress when he got back to work. This put the company itself under stress because it had to work out ways and means to get rid of that fellow. </PARA>

As an observation about stress, may I say that in the whole of my working life I have never seen a genuinely busy person suffer from stress&mdash;never. I have seen a lot of idle people pretending they were busy suffering from great stress. The most stressful thing to do to people to really stress them out is put them in a room with nothing to do.

That is the whole problem with this Labor government, the attitude of the opposition and the difficulties we are having in the economy. A group of business people&mdash;the wealth creators in Australia&mdash;who employ the people, the 800,000 small business people Senator Bell referred to, have an opinion and Senator McMullan interjects and says, `What would you expect them to say'?</PARA></TALK.START>

We have one million people out of work, not helped by these crazy schemes introduced by this government to impose penalties and conditions that detract from the requirement to employ more people. In fact, if we were to talk to these small business people today they would say that what is wrong with this country is that we have a whole series of things that are a disincentive to employ people. It is not just the training guarantee levy. If it were, we would not have the problem. We have a range of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have incredible redundancy payments that have to be made. The crazy thing about that is that when a company gets itself into bother and needs to lay off people, that is when it has financial difficulties. So there is a disincentive to employ people on a full-time basis. What this country needs today is incentives to employ people on a full-time basis. Yet the whole thrust of all these policies is to say, `Let's not put them on a full-time basis, let's employ as many as we can as casuals'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that&mdash;and I see Senator Burns opposite&mdash;are the unions trying to push businesses into employing people on a full-time basis. I do not disagree with that but we cannot push against the tide. If all the government policies&mdash;and we have got stacks of them&mdash;are to have a climate where there is a disincentive to employ people full time, it does not matter what happens on the side of the unions, people are going to get nowhere. Once the government goes down this track, as it has done on its industrial relations bill as well, there is a disincentive for employers to put people on full time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another remark struck me in the report put out by the majority committee. As I said, with all the evidence, it should have said, `Let's abandon this silly stuff', but instead it said, `Let's support the amendments.' It said that Professor Jim Gaite and Ms Karen Beresford of the University of South Australia reported to the committee on their research into the training needs of small business. It is important to reflect on this because the general view on all sides is that small business is the creator of employment in this country. Their research indicated that small business expenditure on training had been little affected by the training guarantee; it provides little incentive for small business to engage more fully in training activity; and the administration and record keeping required was disproportionately burdensome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They indicated their personal view that despite the considerable changes in the attitude of Australian firms towards training, they still require further prodding. I do not know what they mean by that but if we want this country to be able to get off its backside and employ some of those one million out of work that were caused by the recession we had to have, according to Paul Keating, there is only one way to do that and that is to get off the back of business and to get rid of those disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those disincentives, no doubt, for those who are involved in training is this training guarantee levy.

It is for that reason that the legislation was necessary&mdash;to ensure that these people, who really do not accept their responsibility not only to the industry and to the people who work for them but also to society in general&mdash;and who do no training at all&mdash;do some training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only recently that unions have looked at multiskilling, embraced it and been cooperative in regard to it. Of course, that is a question of horizontal skilling rather than vertical skilling. Vertical skilling is also a consideration.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the metal industry, for instance, the unions have been very supportive of this proposition. The employers have recognised that it is very helpful and gives them a more skilled and flexible work force. But many of the metal unions are saying that when these people are trained, either academically or properly at the workface, they should get recognition for it. They should get a certificate which indicates what their skills level is and the experience that they have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though one would think that many employers would believe Father Christmas had arrived if they got multiskilling, flexibility and cooperation, they are resisting the idea of giving recognition to people who have those skills levels and experience. This is another twist in the issue of people failing to pick up their responsibility in terms of training and skilling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer and others have talked about the fact that there will always be transfers of staff. I have no problem with that, and neither does the trade union movement. If two companies which are good trainers find that an employee of one or the other is attractive to them and are prepared to offer that person employment, that is a good thing; there is no problem. It is when those who will not train seek to take the benefit of those who have trained that I have an objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer also said that there is an abuse of the system. He talked about funny systems where some companies have decided that rather than allowing the money to go to the government they will put on special trips and special supposed training exercises which are not training and really are just a waste of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeking to make the legislation more flexible and easier to work with. It provides an opportunity and some compulsion for employers to train people properly, which, as I said, and I repeat, is something that is accepted in the community because of the need for a well-trained work force. Some people have always been involved in training and see it as a reasonable, proper approach which is absolutely instrumental in increasing productivity in terms of quality and delivery of goods. All these things are so important in getting contracts and having them continue. They are all the things that we look at in this regard. We provide the opportunity for people to abide by the legislation. As I said, those who provide training do not have a problem. They already spend the money wisely and sensibly, so there is nothing in addition for them to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the fault of the legislation that there are those who do not wish to spend the money and who want only to abuse the system and waste money. I would be absolutely amazed if any employer of any significance could say with honesty that his or her work force did not require training. It is true that there may be odd exceptions where people have been in a job for many years and there is no turnover in staff; but even then there are new things coming up all the time&mdash;and training is a useful process. There is no fault in the desire of the government to seek proper and well-trained people in the community, as I said, and thus increase productivity and make society a better place to live in. The fault is with the people who create the abuses. I suggest those on the other side of the chamber address that issue and support the proposition put forward by the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are really two issues before us in the second reading debate and they will come up for consideration in detail in the committee stage. One is whether the legislation should continue and the other is the form in which it should continue if the sunset clause proposal is defeated. There is no contention about the desirability of the general thrust of these amendments if the legislation continues, as, of course, the government is advocating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with those issues in sequence, but not at great length because, as I have said, the committee stage will give us a chance to do that. The worst thing would be to unduly take the time of the Senate to rehearse a debate that properly will be conducted in the committee stage. But I think they are both second reading matters. They have been addressed at length by participants in the second reading debate. I will not deal with them in the same length, but they certainly warrant response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will address the overall question as to whether Australia should ever have had training guarantee levy legislation and whether the training guarantee has in fact played a socially useful role. First and foremost there has been no doubt that the training guarantee legislation has been part of that body of changes taking place in Australia over recent years which has fundamentally lifted the profile and focus of training. No change takes place in isolation. There are a whole range of changes taking place in our society. There is a fundamental change in the education and training of young Australians, most notably illustrated by the doubling during the last decade of the number of young Australians going on to year 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of changes are taking place. At the same time, we cannot isolate one and say how we can study it totally in isolation. But there is no doubt in my mind, as a consequence of the discussions I have had over the years on the operation of this legislation, that all those people, other than the most hidebound ideological critics&mdash;we have heard some of them in this debate&mdash;believe that this training guarantee has been part of the process of lifting the profile of and focus on training in Australia. At the initiation of this measure it was fundamental that that profile be lifted. It remains important that Australia continue to have an active training program within our enterprises as well as within our training institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that there is not a debate about whether training is important; I will not rehearse that. We all agree that is critical to enhancing Australian efficiency and competitiveness as the world economy becomes more open, and a crucial element of competitiveness is the skill level of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns was right to make the point that some people were unreasonably taking advantage of the responsible employers by failing to discharge their training obligation. That is a burden on the most efficient employers. What we had, until this training guarantee emphasis, was that the businesses which were most responsible, either nationally or in their own long-term self-interest, were being imposed upon by a sort of privately imposed tax by the businesses that were not training. They were inflating the training cost of the good businesses by poaching the trained staff. This is a measure about training, encouraging and assisting the responsible employers. In my view, that is the reason why we should not be voting for this sunset clause legislation. Other than those senators who adopt a blinkered approach&mdash;and there are some in this place&mdash;it seems a bit odd to be advocating that in advance of the evaluation of the scheme that is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get to the amendments about which I wish to say two things. They are not about a fundamental clash of principle between government and opposition, because we are all saying that there should be enhancement of the grouping provisions and that there should be some carry forward provisions. It is a question of how wide, how long and whether those two can interrelate. That is putting aside the third amendment, which is the one that goes to the continuing operation of the bill. We have a fundamental disagreement about that amendment, but as to the other two we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the ironic situation that people come in here saying that this legislation is too complex and they then propose amendments that seek to make it more complicated. They cannot have it both ways. The fundamental reason that the government does not agree with these amendments should appeal to opposition senators because the problem is they impose more complexity than they add benefit. It is not that they are inherently bad ideas but that on a cost benefit basis they impose more complexity than they add benefit. We think that should not happen. </PARA>

<PARA>In proposing these amendments our intention is to make this bill even more flexible for business. We wish to make it more possible to allow the training guarantee arrangements to be averaged over a group of businesses, wider than is envisaged by the current bill. That is the outcome if the Senate supports these three amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that if there is a group of businesses that are linked together under company law in the same way that they can, in other elements of their companies' operations, link their operations, there may be a choice for that group of businesses to have training schemes in common or to monitor and account for their training programs and their spending on training across a group instead of by individual businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) has put up only one objection to this. He has taken up the quite legitimate argument that Senator Watson puts from time to time that we have very wordy tax legislation and often equally wordy amending bills which make life complex for people who have to operate the tax law. In this instance I believe that is an Aunt Sally; it is not an appropriate analogy to be used as relating to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the committee, absolutely manifestly, this bill that is before us comprises 10 pages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague has accurately described the purpose of these amendments. It is pointless to reiterate that. They seek to allow access to grouping and carry-forward provisions at the same time. What they do not do is deal with the issues of who owns the excess and who has responsibility for the shortfalls as one allows the interaction between the grouping provisions and the carry-forward provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each provision has merit and is being supported by everybody here, but they do not go to the issue: if one makes a choice, who owns the excess payment? Which part of the group or who is responsible for the shortfall? I am not saying that it is impossible to draft amendments that do that, but that is where the complication arises. It does not arise from what Senator Teague has done, but from what we will have to do to make his provision work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the committee decides to support this, as I say, we are not going to take our bat and ball and go home. We will seek to give effect in the House of Representatives to the Senate's intention by redrafting the amendments, sending them back to the Senate, and having the same purpose with better drafting, but it will make it more complicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we did not do this was not because we did not think of it or that it was a heinous principle, but that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel advised that a legislative scheme which provided access to both the grouping and carry-forward provisions and dealt adequately with the ownership and responsibility issues would be excessively complex; that is, the benefit that would flow would not justify the added complication. Therefore, we do not think it should be done. We will come back with that complex option if we are required to do so, but I urge the committee not to require us to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the groups of amendments proposed by the coalition, I think it would expedite matters if I addressed both groups&mdash;amendments 1, 7 and 8, and 2 to 6 and 9&mdash;proposed by Senator Teague. I indicate the Democrats will support both of those groups but will reject proposed amendments 10 and 11. The reasons for that are that, in seeking to make the best of the legislation that we have here, it is quite evident that what we are really about is making more flexible the provisions that apply to enterprises; to allow the decisions about training to be taken at an enterprise level in a way that is as flexible as possible to accommodate the variety of training needs that exist in industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training needs should be emphasised. Training should be allocated, to borrow a phrase from another place, according to need. That is not an expression that was invented just recently. In fact, it is part of the well-established theory of human resource management that good human resource management practices take place after a training needs analysis has been instituted at the enterprise level. The enterprise should then be able to conduct its training according to that training needs analysis rather than other constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the constraints that have been applied to enterprises have been applied by the timetable and the regulations which attach to the training guarantee scheme. In reducing the rigidity of that scheme and allowing greater flexibility, we come closer to the opportunity for human resource management divisions of enterprise to be able to provide training according to the training needs analysis rather than artificial constraints provided by legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we support the first two components of the coalition's proposed amendments. I understand what Senator McMullan is saying about the fact that, with regard to compliance with the legislation, complications will be added to the legislation, but I honestly believe that complying with the training needs analyses of their enterprises will become easier at the enterprise end.

<PARA>I thank Senator Bell for his comments and analysis. He has foreshadowed the argument I now put in favour of these amendments. I certainly thank him for the carefulness with which this has been considered by him and his colleagues.

I am not going to go over my speech on the second reading debate but merely point out that this is a flawed bill. It must be suspended. It needs to cease its operations and we will see better training outcomes as a result. </PARA>

I do not fully accept that. There will always be limitations when there are surveys but I nevertheless list the arguments that he has put at large and to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I will continue the listing: to Professor Gaite, also referred to by Senator Carr, and Ms Karen Beresford; to the study at Monash University by Tim Henson; to the condemning of this whole measure by the Business Council of Australia; and to the call by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the scrapping of this legislation. Other senators have referred to others that have made similar assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been our view from the beginning that this is flawed legislation. It is a firm promise of the Liberal and National parties that this would be one of the imposts on business and industry that we in the coalition would remove as soon as we had the opportunity to do so. Accordingly, the amendments that are now before us, Nos 10 and 11, would see this whole piece of legislation ceasing on the first day of July of this year which is the fourth anniversary of the operation of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finally put it to Senator Bell to get on with this action now where he can take the initiative. I say this through you, Mr Deputy Chairman: be a part of the action that is successful now, before this government does the same thing in the May budget. The honourable senators opposite are aware of the arguments such as those to which I referred in my speech in the second reading debate and which I have listed just now. With the exception of some people, such as Senator Carr and Senator Burns, who do not seem to be convinced yet, it may well be that there is a majority in caucus, certainly a majority in the budget cabinet of this government, who want to see measures that are responsive to the requests of business and industry, and to see the end of this legislation. Then training can be built in with other incentives and be more effective for the kinds of outcomes in training that will make Australia all that much more internationally competitive. I therefore make this final appeal to the Democrats and to other honourable senators that they join with the coalition in voting for these final two amendments in order to get ahead of the government's budget, when it is likely to also abolish this whole scheme. </PARA>

As Professor Gaite also indicated, they will not necessarily reflect his assessment of what was actually happening with his report, but an attitude that is being expressed by some small-minded, narrow-minded, ignorant people about the way in which they should conduct their business affairs. Of course, it is understandable that some people will want to bludge on others. It is understandable that in business people seek to take advantage of their competitors. That is not necessarily a correct approach that should be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been indicated that lots of rorts are going on in this area. Mr Flood has appeared before the Senate committee. He is the officer from the Australian Taxation Office responsible for compliance management. He indicated that, in his experience, in the experience of the Australian Taxation Office, for some 20 years businessmen have been taking trips to various things and a prime aim was to get a tax deduction. In relation to the training guarantee, our experience has been that not a lot of that sort of thing has been claimed for the training guarantee. Certainly, newspapers tend to think that everybody who goes on an overseas trip or somewhere is doing it for the purposes of the training guarantee with training funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not what we have found with our audit program. We have been asked for a full substantiation of nearly 1,000 cases. In only about 60 of those cases have attempts been made to claim what we might call `junket conferences'&mdash;only 60. Now we are talking here about measures that apply to companies with payrolls of more than $220,000. We are talking about perhaps 70,000 companies that are actually able to be covered by this particular measure. Under the Taxation Office's own estimates, its audit programs, we find 60 that are ripping off the scheme. So it is totally inappropriate to suggest that this scheme is invalid, and an attempt to de-legitimise it on the basis of rorts is a pretty cheap shot. To try to illegitimise the scheme, based on the actions of a few people, is not an appropriate political strategy, I suggest, if people really do have the interests of this country at heart, and if they really do have an interest in making sure we have a flexible and highly trained work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak today on a matter of great importance to me and to all Western Australians, and that is the matter of fire safety in Western Australia. There is a growing concern in the community about the protection of Western Australian citizens from the ravages of fire and the protection offered to professional and volunteer firefighters in Western Australia as a result of a proposal put by the Western Australian Fire Brigade board to reduce services and to reduce staffing currently provided for fire protection in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in this matter, being a former official of the firefighters union of Western Australia. I am still an honorary member of that union, a position I am very proud of. My concern today arises from the success of that union in achieving appropriate salary levels for professional firefighters in Western Australia in a recent decision of the Western Australian Industrial Commission. In that decision the full bench of the commission awarded significant pay increases to professional firefighters, to be phased in over the next year or so. That was the umpire's verdict after a very long wage contest between the brigade and the union, spanning more than three years. The dispute was eventually brought to arbitration because of the failure to achieve a conciliated result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the cause of my concern is that the Western Australian Fire Brigade board's response to that decision of the industrial commission has been to look at the financial impact of that decision on the board and attempt to reduce its fire services to accommodate increased costs to its budget. I am the first to admit that the cost of wages is a large proportion of the Western Australian Fire Brigade board's budget and is the most significant expenditure item. I am happy to concede that the wage decision represents a major impost on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as often happens in such matters, the board has taken it upon itself to see the answer in reducing fire services and protection to the Western Australian community rather than in attempting to convince government that appropriate funding ought to be made available to continue the established service and protection levels that are required in Western Australia. I think it is very worrying and an indictment of the Western Australian Fire Brigade board that it seems to have adopted a position of reducing services and reducing the community protection level that it established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board has recommended a proposal which seeks to reduce crewing on certain appliances, particularly at certain country fire stations&mdash;which I am sure is of concern to Senator Panizza&mdash;and also to take appliances off line. The phrase `on line' refers to appliances being staffed and available on call to fight fires and other emergencies within the metropolitan area. The proposal would have the impact of reducing the brigade's expenditure by reducing the number of firefighters employed in fire protection at any one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people in the Western Australian community who understand these issues are greatly concerned about this reduction in fire protection levels. It is always difficult to determine what is the appropriate amount of protection. Obviously services cannot always meet all the demands that are placed upon them. Nevertheless, Western Australia currently has an approved level of service and fire protection to meet the minimum requirements established under professional firefighting guidelines. The proposals that the fire board has put forward seek to reduce that level of protection, and to put at risk the Western Australian community and its firefighters. I think it is of grave concern to the whole Western Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two things that the board is proposing that are most likely to have an immediate effect. The first is the abandonment of safety crewing. The safety crewing concept is internationally recognised as the minimum desirable crew required to attend on a first appliance at an emergency. Safety crewing requires that the first firefighting appliance has to have a crew of four firefighters. This is based on the requirements for wearing breathing apparatus and safe firefighting techniques. The four firefighters are required so that two firefighters can enter the burning premises, search for people trapped inside and deal with the fire. The other two firefighters stay outside to provide assistance and backup for the two inside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety crewing is a very well-established, international safety requirement of firefighting. To its credit, the fire brigade board has argued for and struggled for years to implement safety crewing in Western Australia. Approximately four years ago, we were successful in achieving the establishment of a safety crewing program to ensure that all first-attending appliances in Western Australia were safety crewed. However, this proposal by the board will reduce safety crewing. It will mean that, in a number of centres, fewer than the minimum of four firefighters will be on those first-responding appliances. The regional centres of Geraldton, Bunbury and Albany are of particular concern. These centres are a long way from the metropolitan area and a long way from professional backup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Geraldton and Albany, if there were a major fire or a major incident in one of these centres, backup from other professional services would be over four hours away, which is a long time. It would be almost impossible to provide adequate support for the firefighters and for the community. Local volunteer brigades provide enormous service as backup to the professional brigades in those regions, but their equipment is limited. I would be the first to say that they are inadequately serviced, in terms of equipment, training and other needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the reality is that those centres are extremely isolated in terms of professional backup for first-attending appliances. The board's decision will mean that the lives of firefighters in those regional centres will be put at risk. Make no mistake about that. It is also putting at risk the lives of the volunteer firefighters who back up the professional firefighters. The board's proposal has this fundamental problem. It is a problem that will come back to haunt the government, unless something is done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of concern is the board's suggested decommissioning of second-line appliances at a number of key metropolitan stations. It is a fact that second-line appliances are generally located in the vicinity of Perth's major hospitals. They are located there because of the established higher risk involved in firefighting in those particular places. The station at Fremantle provides backup to the Fremantle Hospital&mdash;I do not mention that for any purpose relating to the by-election. The Daglish Fire Station, as Senator Panizza would well understand, provides an important backup service to Perth's major hospitals&mdash;the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women and the Hollywood Hospital, which is the old repatriation hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those stations are there for very good reasons: they are there to help protect lives in the case of a major incident at those hospitals. I think every senator would be aware that an incident at a hospital would be a particularly dangerous situation, given the number of persons who would be unable to get themselves out of the buildings. This proposal is a real threat to the protection offered to the Western Australian community and a real threat to the lives of Western Australian firefighters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that this reflects the problem of the composition of fire brigade funding in Western Australia. Essentially, the funding of the fire brigade is made up of a 75 per cent contribution from insurance premiums and 12 1/2 per cent each from local government and state government authorities. The impact of that system of funding is that the Western Australian fire brigade board is dominated by the  considerations of where the funds to meet the needs of the brigade are to be raised. A lot of the representatives on the Western Australian fire brigade board have a very keen eye to their own constituencies, be they the insurance companies or the local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny or decry their very real problems in meeting brigade funding but I think it really is a reflection on the adequacy of the system. When it comes to the question of appropriate fire protection, it seems of more concern where the local government authorities or the insurance companies are going to be able to find the funding for the brigade, rather than the primary question of the proper protection to be offered to Western Australian society and the protection to be offered to firefighters. We really have to call upon the state government and call upon the Minister for Emergency Services, Mr Wiese, to put the protection of the community first and ensure that funding is made available to retain the existing fire protection standards established by the fire brigade board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of concern that exists in the fire brigade about these proposals is reflected in the fact that the chief fire officer has written to the Minister for Emergency Services expressing his concern about the proposals. He does not support the proposed reduction in staffing and is fearful of the risks that it poses for the community and for firefighters. I think the views of the chief fire officer in Western Australia have to be given great credence and he has expressed serious concern about these propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware of the deaths that occurred in New South Wales during the recent bushfires and honourable senators from Queensland would be aware of the tragic loss of two professional firefighters in an incident in a fire in Queensland recently. It brings home to us the real dangers involved in firefighting, both for professional and for volunteer firefighters. Because of the extremely good safety record and professional standards set in Australia over the years, it is easy to forget the very real dangers faced by firefighters every day of their lives. It is easy to discount those dangers and the risks at which they put firefighters and the community in the event of fire or other emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to make an outrageous, emotional plea in relation to this matter. I do not want to use the sort of terminology used by my friends opposite in relation to another matter&mdash;about people having blood on their hands&mdash;because I find that sort of rhetoric totally inappropriate.

What I am saying and what I am calling on the Western Australian government to do is to provide leadership to ensure the maintenance of professional fire prevention standards in Western Australia. The minister must act, not try to wash his hands of the issue or appear publicly to be supportive but not act. If the minister is not up to the job he ought to resign. The Western Australian government has an obligation to maintain proper fire protection standards for the community and to maintain the safety crewing standards for the firefighters involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week, in the debate on matters of public interest, I spoke about the dreadful loss of population from rural Australia, which concerns us all, and about the syndrome `get big or get out', which is certainly one of the factors in that loss of population. Today I would like to extend that debate and say that that same syndrome&mdash;get big or get out&mdash;is also part of the cause of the crippling debt facing many of our farm families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago I attended a seminar in Roma in central Queensland on the future of the family farm. At that seminar one of the big debates was about this very issue, to get big or get out. The response of one of the farmers on that occasion was that farm families are often people with big hearts and big hats, but they are even bigger&mdash;expletive deleted&mdash;fools. `Get big or get out' is something that farmers have been hearing for 15 or 20 years; yet, having followed that advice, they find themselves in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard story after story of farmers, in response to that demand of them, buying adjoining properties in the early 1980s. At the time they often had little or no debt. By the late 1980s, having bought those properties, the same farmers faced ruin because of the unsustainable interest rates they endured during those years. The capital debt on some properties doubled in three years because of the incredibly high rates of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give just a few examples to underline what I am saying. The Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation conducted a survey of woolgrowers in its area. The woolgrowers were asked a number of questions, including one about their perceived viability; in other words, whether they felt that in the long term they would be viable. Only 18 per cent thought they would be; 48.9 per cent thought they were borderline in terms of viability; and 33.1 per cent said that they could not be viable in the long term. In other words, an astounding 82 per cent of respondents considered their viability in 1993-94 as either borderline or not viable. However, they were asked this further question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If interest rates on all rural borrowings were reduced to six per cent during the current commodity downturn, would you be viable?</PARA>
<PARA>If interest rates were reduced to that level, 79.7 per cent of respondents said that they could be viable, while 20.3 per cent still believed they would not be able to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So an astounding 82 per cent of respondents considered their financial viability in 1993-94 as borderline or not viable at all but 79 per cent turned that around, in terms of a reduction in interest rates to six per cent. The Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provides an excellent case to the Federal Government to trigger the `exceptional circumstances' provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague Senator Lees also gave some figures last week in a speech on debt in South Australia, particularly for clients of the rural counselling service.

<PARA>I could perhaps give honourable senators an international perspective on this. A recent UNICEF report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The State of the World's Children 1992, Summary</EMPHASIS> says this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"But it is, above all, the weight of past debts which threaten future progress . . . the developing world owes approximately $1,300 billion to the governments and banks of the industrialized nations and to international financial institutions.

As it is impossible to meet these interest charges in full, the amount unpaid is added to the total debt owed . . .

<PARA>It further states, `Debt is the new slavery that has shackled the African continent'. The article goes on to speak about what is happening to people in the Third World.

What is to be done, of course, is the obvious question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, I would like to recommend that the Senate heed the call of the Queensland Grain Growers Association president, Ian Macfarlane.

<PARA>I urge the government to take note of the very many voices which are calling for a tackling of this whole issue of rural debt&mdash;and not only for that, but for a tackling of the very thorny issue of debt reorganisation, even of debt write-off. I want to give a theological perspective on this and to point out that, for some 1,500 years, the church would not allow the charging of interest on loans; this was prohibited. It is only in the last couple of hundred years that the prohibition against what was called usury has been relaxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I underline that by saying that there has been an attempt by numbers of people within the Australian churches, and certainly in campaigns conducted by the World Council of Churches, to tackle the world-wide problem of debt, particularly its effect on Third World nations, especially those involved in growing food. Around the world, that is where debt is hitting the hardest. I refer the Senate to the Hebrew scriptures and to the model there, which is probably 3000 years old, of the jubilee and sabbatical years in which the call was for debts to be written off, slaves to be released and land to be returned to the families who originally owned that land. Those concepts need a lot of translation to be relevant to our situation today but, whatever the starting point, wherever we begin in order to tackle debt and interest rates, whatever analysis we use of the problem we face and whatever solution we propose, the issue of debt slavery must be tackled. </PARA>

He asked what plans have been made to move the fleet base from Garden Island to White Bay. The answer is none. I received on 31 July 1993 a letter from the Prime Minister that asked me to look at the feasibility of that. I subsequently met with the Prime Minister on 8 September to discuss that issue with him. We had a general discussion on whether there would be any possibility of this fitting in with the belief that the land around the fleet base&mdash;and especially on Garden Island&mdash;could be used for the purposes of recreation for the benefit of Sydney people. It was not as suggested in last night's report that we would put a large housing development on it. That discussion,  I think I could summarise in relation to the Prime Minister and me, remained fairly inconclusive.

Senator MacGibbon mentioned costs, which would be an absolutely critical factor. We would have to look at whether there is any benefit for the defence force. The area we concentrated on and which has had no publicity was ADI's plan to retract from Garden Island itself to the core business. Having probably visited the site, Senator MacGibbon would probably realise a large part of Garden Island is basically small workshops, tennis courts, residences et cetera. It may well be possible, if we want to add to the glamour of Sydney Harbour, for the ADI operations to retract back to their core business area around the dry dock and leave the rest for the Sydney public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy because his question does raise an issue of some importance. It is too little appreciated that the improving export performance that Australia is showing is not just a product of our traditional markets and the success in increasing export manufactures, but more and more it is in the intangible items that we cannot see&mdash;the services that are providing enhancement to our export performance. I do not think this gets enough attention or consideration. I was therefore pleased to see the article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which reinforced this argument.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has initiated a major study of the services sector, it has the potential on the initial reports, which Senator Cook and I have seen, to be as significant as the McKinsey study on emerging exporters has been for the manufacturing sector. It is too early to say that definitively because the report is not concluded, but the initial reports are very encouraging and very interesting. They have raised a lot of important issues; they encourage one to think that not only are we doing well but that there is enormous potential to do much more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably underestimated that services already account directly for 20 per cent of our exports. That fact is not taken into account when people think about the various elements of our trade. Services make an enormous contribution to merchandise exports.

The last figures I saw showed that up to 40 per cent of export market development grant recipients in 1992 were service companies. The successful negotiation of the Uruguay round gives an enhanced opportunity to succeed in this area. A lot of Australians are doing very good business in this area. It is creating wealth and jobs in the country and opportunities for Australians around the world. There is more to do, and I think when this study is released in the middle of the year it should engender a lot of interest for members of parliament in general, and the community more broadly, about where the opportunities are for Australia and Australians into the next century.</PARA>

Yet to the extent that there is a shortfall, I will rectify that after question time or at the next available opportunity. But let me say generally about all this that the Australian government does view trade in hazardous wastes as a serious matter and will certainly act to ensure that any such trade is environmentally sound.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a much more environmentally positive story to tell. There is no doubt that the power generation sector is and will remain a greenhouse gas producing industry. However, the COAG reform agenda is set to increase the amount of power produced per unit of fuel burned. There are a number of reasons why this will be achieved: there will be a more efficient use of existing generating capacity through more grid interconnections; older and less efficient plant will close over time; and new, more environmentally benign capacity will come on stream. The new capacity will have very modern, integrated carbon scrubber technologies built in rather than added on as they currently are in the older power stations. Real opportunities for co-generation using fuels other than coal, for example, natural gas, will be opened up.</PARA>

I regard that as a massive step forward for the nation of Australia in addressing and quickening the pace of micro-economic reform, because I believe fundamentally that the precepts in the competition policy will, by creating genuine competition in our ports and as between ports, and in rail, in road, and in electricity generation and supply, be a means of levering forward the next generation of micro-economic reform.</PARA>

It is what the statistics show and what the circumstances that have given rise to those statistics dictate.</PARA>

In the massive economy which already exists in India there is a significant middle-class market, the smallest assessment being $100 million plus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time Senator Coulter asked me a question about the export of hazardous wastes. The only thing I need to add to the answer given previously for the sake of completeness is this: the question of a ban on the export of hazardous wastes from OECD to non-OECD countries will be considered at the Basel Convention conference of parties meeting in Geneva on 21 to 25 March. While Australia presently has in place a de facto ban in relation to exports to non-OECD countries for disposal, the issue of extending this ban to cover recoverables is complex. The government is presently considering its position on this issue, recognising that the need to ensure that the trade in recoverables is conducted in an environmentally sound manner while not unnecessarily regulating trade in material which is both commercially and environmentally valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have already acknowledged that there are deficiencies in the act so far as the regulations on recoverable waste are concerned, but they are being addressed in the review of the whole trade in waste.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to hazardous wastes.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that 98 per cent of the world's hazardous waste comes from the 24 OECD countries. Contrary to what the minister said in answer to a question last week about the rich countries being able to afford to clean up their environment, the shipment of these toxic wastes to Third World countries indicates the fallacy of this idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's stupidity&mdash;or is it wilful neglect of the facts?&mdash;is also indicated by Australia's action in resisting the tightening of the Basel Convention to the extent that it would ban the movement of these wastes across trans-national boundaries. The fact is that the rich nations are running out of space and, rather than cleaning up their production methods, Australia, along with six other countries, has chosen to export its environmental and health problems to the Third World in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, the minister for the environment has said that Sydney will run out of landfill sites within seven years. In the US, the creation of the super fund to clean up contaminated sites&mdash;those sites contaminated with toxic waste&mdash;has resulted in the discovery of so many sites that it is expected the cost of that clean-up will exceed $400 billion. The cost of landfill in the US rose from $15 per tonne in 1980 to $250 per tonne in 1989. It is no wonder that the rich countries are looking for a cheap alternative such as dumping this dangerous material in Third World countries&mdash;countries which do not have the technology or the financial and economic ability to deal with these wastes safely. In an economic rationalist world it makes a great deal of sense to dump waste in the lowest wage country. As Lawrence Summers, the chief economist with the World Bank, said, the economic logic is impeccable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian mining industry have also strongly supported this practice of dumping hazardous wastes in Third World countries, and why should they not? It brings economic benefits, at least in the short term, to Australia and, more particularly, to the companies that these organisations represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is exporting its hazardous wastes mainly to India and the Philippines. Australia is the world's worst polluter and, contrary to what the minister just said, in absolute terms between 1990 and 1993 exported three times as much as the US on a per capita basis. Our wastes include such things as cadmium, copper, lead and nickel, all of which are hazardous to human health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recycling, of course, is the excuse which is often used and was the excuse which the minister used today. But, in fact, when one looks in these Third World countries one finds that, particularly in the case of lead acid batteries, much of this so-called recycling is going on in backyard establishments in which young children are actually remelting lead dross to get small amounts of lead to turn into recycled metal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Basel Convention places an obligation on states to transfer to states of import no hazardous wastes which are not to be managed in an environmentally sound manner. Yet there is abundant evidence that Australia's wastes are not being handled in an environmentally sound manner in these Third World countries. It also says that first world countries shall only export if the state of export does not have the technical ability and the necessary facilities to dispose of these wastes in an environmentally sound manner. So, clearly, the fact that Australia continues to export these things indicates that Australia has neither the technology nor the facilities, which is simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASEAN nations meeting in September 1993 moved that their governments should prohibit the import and trans-boundary movement of all hazardous waste for any reason into ASEAN countries, and passed a number of other resolutions in this connection. Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Germany, US and UK are the world's worst polluters in this trans-boundary shipment of hazardous waste. It is a disgrace to Australia and I would urge the minister very strongly, in going into that Basel meeting later this month, to move that Australia totally ban the export of this material from Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans's answer was not much of an answer to me, and that surprised me. Last week&mdash;on 24 February&mdash;the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Mr Bilney, in this parliament signed an agreement with Haryono Suyono, the state minister of population and head of the BKKBN, Indonesia's national family planning board.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is ample evidence of the fact that it is not voluntary. Let me give an example. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Indonesia</EMPHASIS> dated March 1992 describes how authoritarian the family planning program is in Indonesia. One aspect is the safari or hunting expedition. The report says that in a subdistrict of West Java people in `difficult' villages were told by field workers that if they refused contraceptives they would have to join the transmigration program to the outer islands. In other cases, unwilling villagers were picked up by military or police personnel and taken to the village head office to have contraceptives inserted. I am using the words of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. The authors said that during their field trip in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IUDs were inserted at gunpoint to those who continued to resist.</PARA>

He then commits the government, extraordinarily, having regard to what the government has said in this matter, to a program of assistance managed through the United Nations population fund to enable Indonesia to provide family planning training and technical assistance to the Pacific countries. Those who are exacting coercion on the Indonesians will be the ones to devise promotion and training for the population programs funded by the Australian taxpayer in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement says that the United Nations population fund, UNFPA, will be involved, as though that gives it some sort of legitimacy.

This indicates to me, and I think it would indicate to the Australian public, that he does not think there is anybody in the whole of caucus who can do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time last year the person holding that position was the Hon. Wendy Fatin. She held the position from 4 April 1990 to 24 March 1993. Then Senator Crowley had it for all of nine months. Then Mrs Kelly had the position for all of three months&mdash;or 3 1/2 months, or whatever it was. Now Paul Keating is in a caretaking position. So all in all, by the time he gets the next person in, the women of Australia will have had five ministers in approximately 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all good faith, women's groups and people who represent the media&mdash;because Minister Kelly saw some of the media about the representation of women in the media&mdash;spend time with these ministers. They inform them and outline their concerns about the issues, and spend a lot of their voluntary time and their own money&mdash;in many cases&mdash;getting to Canberra to speak to people, only to find that they have to start all over again. It was nine months later in the case of Senator Crowley and three months later in the case of Mrs Kelly&mdash;and I do not know how many of them are going to get to see Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the women in caucus were asking him about yesterday. They said, `Is there not somebody to whom these women's groups can go, because they are not likely to get to you'. He said, `If I was'&mdash;not `if I were'&mdash;`a British member, then I would dress up for the occasion', which is inferring, I presume, that he would dress up in drag. It was not a very funny joke and, rightly so, the women in caucus were critical of Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could not expect much else from him. Yesterday when I gave notice of a motion which outlined his maiden speech, somebody said to me, `Oh, well, you know that was his maiden speech. That was 25 years ago.'&mdash;or whatever. It was about the time I was growing up as a young woman trying to establish myself in a career; and I was dealing with people like Mr Keating. He said about the Liberal government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about the increasing number of women in the work force. Rather than something to be proud of I feel that this is something of which we should be ashamed . . . Is this Government doing anything about child endowment? Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? . . . It engages in a lot of claptrap.</PARA>
<PARA>That gives an indication of where he was coming from at the beginning of his career. I do not think he has changed one jot or one skerrick in the time he has been here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poor women in caucus, and some of the SNAGs over there, have not made a skerrick of difference to Mr Keating. In 1980&mdash;we thought he might have learned by then and that the leopard might have changed his spots&mdash;he said to a delegate at an ALP conference, `You know the rules, darling'. Then he said to a journalist in 1992&mdash;Senator Newman remembers this well&mdash;`Well, it is only that colour coordination of yours and that wonderful hairdo that encourage me to give you a very nice reply because you always put the most charming questions'. I hope that when women go to women's groups they have decent hairdos and have the right sort of clothes on and the right colour coordination because then the Prime Minister will feel inclined to give them a decent answer. Obviously, Mr Keating puts some sort of credence on how people look; that is the way he treats them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, when he was responding to a question from journalists on interest rates, as reported on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, said, `Good try, darling. Good try, darling'. John Dawkins said to Mrs Sullivan, `Sweetheart, you don't need a model to work this out'. And so it goes on. There is a number of other examples. I think even Ros Kelly referred to somebody in her office as `the little girl who answers the telephone'. It shows that they have not come anywhere in this debate. They are all talk and no action. The sooner the Prime Minister gets someone, if he can find someone&mdash;for heaven's sake, he does not seem to have anybody there now&mdash;to address women's issues&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill was interrupted I was in full flight responding to an invitation by Senator Teague to accede to his wish to move an amendment which would have the effect of putting a sunset clause on this scheme. I was indicating that the Australian Democrats were not entertained by Senator Teague's temptations and that, in fact, we would be looking for the completion of the Department of Employment, Education and Training review and from that we would hope to see a scheme vastly changed from that which we now have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy scheme has been criticised, and I think rightly so. We hope that such a review will produce a scheme which will meet the requirements which Senator Carr and others previously suggested were very important in industry; that is, to ensure that training is conducted to make sure that workers follow safe practices. We hope the review will produce a scheme which will reduce the incidence of lazy enterprises poaching trained workers from other enterprises. We hope the review will produce a scheme which will reduce the administrative burden which is one of the present scheme's greatest failures. We also hope that the review will produce a scheme which will assure quality training as, at present, the scheme does nothing to ensure that the training conducted is of any particular quality; it only measures quantity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the review will produce a scheme which will recognise good training models. I acknowledge that there is the outstanding trainer model which can be recognised in the present scheme, but there should be much greater emphasis placed on that. Most importantly, we need to look for a scheme which encourages rather than penalises. We cannot do that if we do not have a scheme at all. If we have no scheme we cannot do any of those things which characterise what the Democrats consider to be a properly founded and properly organised training scheme. That is because we recognise that training has a very important role to play in Australian industry. I will conclude with those remarks. I think all the arguments have been well rehearsed in the second reading stage, but I gave that detailed response because of the interruption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating what is now known as the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. It is an omnibus bill that will facilitate minor policy changes as well as make technical and minor amendments to the principal act. In a number of cases these amendments directly result from previous legislative deficiencies and oversights. It is of concern to me that we often spend time in this chamber dealing with the correction of legislation when loopholes have been found. We spend an inordinate amount of time doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing this bill in total but we will be opposing specific parts of it: the imposition of a harsher assets test for primary producers&mdash;a number of my colleagues will speak in more depth about that&mdash;and two measures that relate directly to the current review of the pension income and assets tests. We will also be moving amendments to improve the equity and fairness of the new penalty interest charge regime that this bill seeks to set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak briefly on a number of initiatives in the bill. Firstly, this bill provides for an extension of eligibility for mobility allowance for people with disabilities undertaking jobsearch activities or in a competitive employment and training program who are unable to use public transport. The government informs us that this measure is required to correct an oversight and, as such, obviously will be supported by the coalition. However, I am concerned that extensions to the eligibility for this allowance appear to have been made in such an ad hoc way. It would be appreciated if the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, Senator Crowley, informed the Senate exactly who is now eligible for mobility allowance and, more importantly, who is currently excluded from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will reverse the current situation whereby the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is able to order a stay of a decision even though the Social Security Appeals Tribunal has reaffirmed a departmental decision. The coalition considers this to be a proper approach in such cases where there is obvious considerable doubt about whether a benefit has been correctly paid. I note that the good work of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has forced the government to move amendments removing the retrospective element from this part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the initiative in this bill that will allow the widow B pension to be paid to recent widows in receipt of other benefits without requiring them to go through the process of making a totally new claim. The government should be commended for this initiative, which will reduce stress on these people during a very difficult time in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also welcome the fact that, finally, a social security agreement has been signed with Italy. However, I am concerned about the amount of taxpayers' money that has been spent in travel costs for ministers and bureaucrats in relation to this agreement. With phones, faxes and other modern means of communication, and with consulate staff and, I believe, even some social security staff being located in Italy, it is questionable whether as many politicians and departmental officers needed to jet around the world to finalise this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes relatively minor changes to confidentiality provisions in the principal act. In effect, these changes will mean that it will be an offence to disclose protected information even if the information is innocently obtained. The definition of protected information will be extended to include information that reveals that a person is not known to the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been at the forefront of criticising the lack of effective legislation to protect the confidentiality of client information. We were instrumental in setting up a Senate inquiry in 1991, prior to the ICAC report that was so very critical of this department, and long before the corporate conscience of this government was finally pricked and the government was forced into taking action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be recognised that Social Security has taken positive action to strengthen its legislation in relation to the confidentiality of client information. This is more than can said for some Commonwealth agencies handling client information&mdash;confidential client information in particular. However, legislation is not the only weapon that bureaucracies have at their disposal to protect what is often sensitive information on clients held by them. It is just as important&mdash;probably more important&mdash;that effective administrative practices are put in place to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information and to detect people who disclose such information, usually for their own financial gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the area of adopting appropriate administrative safeguards that the auditor, in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit report No. 23</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">of 1993-94</EMPHASIS>, revealed that this department was grossly deficient. It would be appreciated if the minister informed the Senate as to what action the department is taking to overcome the deficiencies outlined in that report of the auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition supports the confidentiality provisions, I wish to comment briefly on the removal of the 15 sitting days requirement for ministerial determinations relating to public interest disclosures. This amendment may be needed to facilitate this process effectively. However, it removes the important double lock on such disclosures resulting in far greater reliance on ministerial and bureaucratic discretion. In relation to such issues, the buck must stop with the minister. I assure the Senate that the coalition will monitor very closely the impact of this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having disposed of the initiatives that the coalition will be supporting, I wish to turn my attention to those which we will be either opposing or seeking to amend. This bill sets up a new penalty interest charge regime that will apply to ex-clients who refuse to reach an agreement with the department in relation to repayment of debts. This new penalty interest charge, which will be imposed at an annual rate of 20 per cent, will replace the previous one-off additional administrative charge that was imposed on debts unpaid after three months at a rate of $15 plus 10 per cent with a ceiling of $515. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the concept of a penalty interest charge. We believe that measure will introduce a fairer and more appropriate incentive for ex-clients to take positive action to repay debts to Social Security. However, we are very concerned about a number of matters in relation to the administration of this penalty interest charge. In particular, we are concerned that as yet there are no guidelines for administering this charge. In fact, there is no requirement in the legislation for guidelines to be formulated at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social Security has indicated to a Senate committee that it will administer the charge in a commonsense way. But we are not willing to take that for granted. Hence, we will move amendments to require the formulation and use of guidelines in administering this charge. We will also seek to have these guidelines tabled in both houses of parliament as disallowable instruments. We also support the amendments of the Australian Democrats, reflecting recommendations 3 and 4 of the Welfare Rights organisation's submission in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to impose the apportionment rule on a liability that exists in relation to an asset that is in part exempt for the purposes of the assets test. The government is claiming that this provision, which will impose a more rigorous test on assets used for primary production, merely gives effect to its stated intention when the original legislation was passed by parliament. The coalition is flabbergasted&mdash;it is very difficult to find a word, but I suppose that is an adequate one&mdash;that this government claims that the current assets test treats primary producers far more generously than other clients. On the contrary, we contend that the assets test does not take into account the dire circumstances of many farmers, including the fact that they are totally unable to realise these assets. We will oppose this miserly measure. As I said, some of my colleagues will address this particular issue in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will also oppose two measures in this bill that are directly relevant to the current review of the pension income and assets test. First, this bill seeks to provide that certain assets&mdash;namely, the value of certain life interests&mdash;will not be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets. Secondly, the bill seeks to ensure that the assessable period of a non-client partner is taken into account when a client realises a saved non-superannuation investment. As I said, both of these measures directly relate to the current review. The coalition is of the opinion that it is entirely inappropriate for the government to be continually tinkering with the income and assets test while this review is being conducted. For this reason, we will oppose both these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I reiterate that this bill is not an overly controversial or significant piece of legislation. However, as I said, the particular issue of rural families is of very great concern to the coalition. As a result of the close scrutiny that we have given to the bill, we will be moving the amendments that I have foreshadowed in the committee stage. I will address some of the issues in more detail at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains 13 parts. As with most of these broad-ranging social security bills, some amendments contained within the bills the Democrats support and others we believe should be amended or opposed. We welcome the extension of the mobility allowance to those people participating in a competitive employment placement and training program who are funded outside the disability reform package. We also welcome the clarification over AAT stay orders contained in part 3, and the extension of the confidentiality provisions in part 6.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased to see that widows who are eligible for a widow B pension will, under certain circumstances, be paid that pension without the need to submit an application form. Those circumstances include when women are on a wife's or carer's pension immediately before their partner dies. It should be noted, however, that in line with the government's phasing out of the widow B pension many people currently on the carers pension will find that they do not qualify for this pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have tried to understand the philosophy behind the phasing out of the widow B pension, but I think we need to recognise the unique circumstances many of these women are in and make provisions for that. In particular, I refer to the position of women who may have been on a carers pension for many years and find that, when their spouse dies, they are put onto a Jobsearch allowance. Not only does this mean they are thrown back into a job market that they may not have been in for over 20 years, but also that they lose the fringe benefits provided under the carer's pension. We need to ensure that some highly specialised labour market programs are available to these women. We may need to look at some limited extension of fringe benefits to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of representations from constituents have been received by me on this issue, and I intend to spend some time examining it further this year. In fact, I have been asked&mdash;and not because I sought but simply because of the concern in the community&mdash;to speak on a number of programs where around Australia people are telling stories about the disadvantage which they are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most ridiculous situation brought to my attention is that of a number of women in Rockhampton, central Queensland. One of these women in her mid-50s, after caring for her spouse for some years, on his death discovered she was put on a Jobsearch allowance and had to engage in various training programs, one of which was to restore her self-confidence, and so spent two days learning karate. She was then supposed to spend another week in front of a computer, despite the fact that she had no keyboard skills and no idea what computers were about. Before the end of that week she dissolved in tears and had to absent herself from the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another woman told me that she was given $70 to outfit herself so that she could be more presentable to employers. She, of course, pointed out that she would be competing with many young people who would certainly benefit from the outfitting. Her very clear complaint was that `there are no jobs for me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures that I have mentioned&mdash;that is, the extension of the mobility allowance, the clarification of AAT stay orders, the tightening of the confidentiality provisions and the automatic granting of the widow B pension in certain circumstances&mdash;are all beneficial measures for clients, and as such will be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the measures contained in the bill which the Democrats are not so keen to support. Part 5 seeks to establish a new penalty regime for those with outstanding debts to the Department of Social Security. I am certainly glad to see the repeal of the existing mandatory charge, as it most unfairly discriminated against those with a low capacity to repay loans&mdash;particularly those who are still on a social security pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed system, a penalty interest charge will be applied to those non-client debtors who do not enter into an agreement to repay their debt or breach an existing agreement. However, it seems to me that the new system places no clearly defined requirement on the department to make an effort to enter into negotiation with the client. Although I am sure that this is unlikely, it would be possible under the proposed legislation for the department to simply phone the person's home and, if it fails to contact him or her, send out a notice the next day stating its intention to impose a penalty interest charge on the person for failing to enter into an agreement to repay the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ensure that the department issues these notices to impose the penalty only after it has made a reasonable attempt to enter negotiation with the client and has determined that the person is either refusing to enter negotiation or will not accept a reasonable repayment schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I need to say that I have had representation from people who have said that in their experience with the department it is not simply that they have not been contacted but, rather, when they have tried to contact the department and point out their situation they have entered into the most amazing comedy of errors on the part of the department, which almost boggles the imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think the time period in which the penalty interest charge for those who breach their existing agreements needs to be more clearly set out in the legislation, and I foreshadow that I will be moving some amendments to part 5 at the committee stage. Part 4 of the bill will create a debt to the Department of Social Security where a person has been paid a pension or benefit during an AAT stay order, but the appeal is ultimately unsuccessful. In other words, the department will be allowed to recover money it paid to the person in the period between an SSAT ruling and an AAT decision which goes in the department's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that, to date, it has been recognised that payments made while a stay order is in force are not recoverable as debts as they are deemed to have been legally granted. Indeed, payments under a stay order of the SSAT&mdash;that is, while the hearing is in progress&mdash;are not recoverable, even when the SSAT's decision is to affirm the original departmental decision. In the case of sole parent pensioners, the department is required to continue to make payments while the appeal is being determined. Again, these payments do not become debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to change this practice at the final level of appeal&mdash;that is, the stage between the SSAT and the AAT. Thus, an inconsistency will be introduced by this legislation which the Democrats fear the government may seek to rectify in the future by also making those payments under the SSAT stay order recoverable debts. The estimated savings on this measure are minimal, and will have no budgetary effect. The effect on the few people to come under this provision will be significant, and the Democrats will be opposing this part. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will like the next bit even better, Senator Boswell. Part 7 of the bill deals with the assets test as it relates to primary producers. The view of the Democrats in this area is well known to all in the Senate. The Democrats have always believed that the assets test unfairly discriminates against primary producers and on numerous occasions we have sought to rectify this problem by exempting the family farm from the test. When we realise that the average value of a sheep farm in Australia is around $850,000, the average dairy farm around $880,000, a broadacre farm around $900,000 and a beef farm over $1 million, one can see how farmers are shut out of the social security system purely by virtue of working an asset which this government chooses to include in the assets test. We have to remember that the farm is a working asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always been opposed by the government in our attempts to exempt the family farm from the assets test&mdash;and opposed, on occasions, by the opposition. Given that, I was somewhat surprised to read the comments of the shadow minister for social security in the House of Representatives debate on this bill. He said that members of the opposition `think the imposition of the assets test generally on primary productive properties is harsh'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a surprise to us because those opposite have not supported some of the amendments which we have suggested and which have been designed to ease some of that harshness. In line with our belief that the assets test unfairly discriminates against our primary producers we will support any move which grants a concession to farmers under the assets test. As I have said, we have tried on numerous times to address this problem constructively. We hope the government will note our concern and will give a commitment to look into this further and address the problem. We will be opposing part 7 of the legislation. Finally, the explanatory memorandum states that part 9 of this bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">where a non-client partner realises a `saved' non-superannuation investment, the growth (or loss) on the investment that is attributable to the client is the longer of the assessable period for the client or the assessable period for the client's partner.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no idea what that means. If that is in the explanatory memorandum, God help those trying to understand it. However, my staff were able to explain it to me. Apparently the government claims that this amendment simply reflects the practice of the Department of Social Security since 1987 to calculate growth over the longer of these two periods, and that it was an omission in the amendments made in December 1992 that inadvertently removed the legislative basis for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, however, the effect of part 9 will be to reduce the entitlement to DSS payments of those holding investments such as managed investments. As there is a major review to be undertaken of the income and assets testing regime, any tightening in this area, no matter how small, seems unwarranted at this time. Given also that apparently so few people will be affected and there are no financial implications from the measure, there seems little risk in delaying it until that review is completed, particularly as managed investments will be closely examined at that inquiry. So the Democrats will be opposing part 9 of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which imposes new debt apportionment measures. These measures will make it even harder for rural families to qualify for benefits such as the jobsearch allowance and the age pension. A couple of nights ago on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> we were treated to an expose of Labor's neglect of poor rural electorates in its divvying up of sports grants. Today the government is asking the Senate to entrench Labor's anti-rural syndrome in legislation. The decision to allocate social security benefits to urban Labor electorates while denying the same rights to families in National Party seats is being written on a page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as opposed to a whiteboard, but the principle is still the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the lot of two families, the Smiths from the city and the Joneses from the country. The city Smiths live in a leafy suburb with nearby parks, sporting facilities, cinemas, shops, schools, hospitals, dentists, sewerage, water and public transport. The country Joneses live on a property 150 kilometres from the nearest town. If it is a Queensland town it has probably recently lost its courthouse, railway workers, doctor, policeman and DPI station. One bank has already shut its doors, the postal service is threatened, and the school has just lost another teacher. The Jones beef and sheep property has shown a substantial loss for three years running and is coming up for a fourth, due to the drought. They have been feeding dwindling stock for three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jones is at her wits end trying to teach the younger children through School of the Air and keeping up with on-farm work commitments because they cannot afford hired help. The eldest boy has been pulled out of boarding school to help run the place. His older sister is in the city and has gone on the dole because she cannot get Austudy due to her parents' assets. Over the years the Joneses and their parents and grandparents have contributed millions of dollars of export income to Australia&mdash;which has helped finance the expansion of city services. The banks are on their back for interest payments. Mr Jones manages to get some cash income from shooting feral goats. Eighteen months ago they liquidated their remaining non-essential asset&mdash;Mr Jones's insurance policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is March 1994. Mr Smith in the city is retrenched from his job. Having little assets apart from the family home he quickly qualifies for JSA and starts a retraining program. His wife is hopeful of finding part-time work. It is not easy to meet repayments and they have to cut down their weekly expenditure. The Joneses, meanwhile, are facing some difficult decisions. The rural adjustment scheme which last year considered them viable in the long-term has just notified them that they will not be receiving an interest subsidy any longer; they cannot prove that they have been operating profitability for two of the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of this downturn, the bank&mdash;which in Queensland also administers the RAS scheme on behalf of the federal government&mdash;has rung them to say it is thinking of foreclosing and it has received an offer of $5 an acre&mdash;well below the current valuation of the property. The lender advises them to sell. The RAS administrator, sometimes also a lender, advises them to apply for farm household support to keep food on the table while they sell up, and then apply for a re-establishment grant to help purchase a house when they move out to an unknown place with unknown job prospects, or they can apply for JSA or, if old enough, the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joneses have known that this decision was coming and it has caused them a great deal of distress. Mrs Jones is very worried about her husband who is very depressed. She hopes he does not turn violent as some of their neighbours have done. She hopes her son does not become too affected by their problems and suicides, like her young cousin. She is not looking forward to contacting the drought community centre the next day and being put on their charity list for food credit. She knows the woman who runs that centre and that makes it worse, but at least she will get a trip to town, thanks to the donated petrol voucher from the Red Cross. She misses not ringing her sister, but the phone bill would be too high. She is worried that the younger children are behind in their school work and that she does not spend enough time with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the assistance of the rural counsellor whom they have waited six months to see, they pore over the paperwork. They decide that since $5 an acre would still leave them with money owing, they will try to hang on and get something out of their investment. It would take only a couple of good seasons and they would be back on top again. They look at the conditions of taking farm household support; it is like JSA for nine months but then it becomes a loan until they have sold up, and it is available for only two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joneses do not like their chances of selling up within nine months at a fair price, so they would be taking another loan if they took farm household support. This is anathema to them. They feel like a gun is being held to their heads: `Sell up or pay back your living allowance'. When the government first introduced the farm household support it announced that it expected 1,400 farmers to go on it in the first year. Eleven months later, in August 1993, there were 380 families receiving farm household support. These were also the toughest times in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first six months of 1993, there were 136 approvals for re-establishment grants at a cost of $5.7 million. At the same time, there were 519 approvals for interest subsidies under normal RAS which cost $6.3 million. It cost nearly as much to throw 136 people off the land as it did to keep 519 going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Joneses turn to the JSA conditions. There will be great difficulty meeting the assets test they are told, but if they are prepared to go through the appeal process, which takes up to six months to get valuations and so forth, they might just make it. Mrs Jones decides to apply, although the idea of being on the dole is very foreign. Nevertheless, food on the table is the top priority. Because she lives so far from town, she will have to approach neighbours who are worse off than she is for work in order to fulfil the JSA conditions of seeking employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joneses are warned, however, that if they stay on JSA for longer than nine months they forfeit their access to any re-establishment grant if they are forced to leave after all. They are given another piece of advice by an ex-neighbour who now squats in the old shearer's shed on their property. If they do have to leave, they must go quietly and not put up any fuss about the purchase price or they could endanger receiving their re-establishment benefit. The RAS administrator&mdash;also a lender in Queensland, the QIDC&mdash;has the power to knock back applications if the farmer does not leave the property in a so-called orderly fashion. The Joneses' newly acquired sundowner explains that he kicked up a fuss, was sold up for a song and he still owed money, but was refused a re-establishment grant because of his so-called disorderly behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joneses decide that their only alternative is to try for JSA and hope that the seasons turn around in time for them to show some improvement before nine months are up. In May 1993 the government's best estimate of the number of farmers or their spouses on JSA was between 4,000 and 4,500. When Mrs Jones rings up the next day to further inquire about the JSA, she uses the freephone service which eventually connects her to a social security officer in Perth who has no knowledge of rural conditions. Mrs Jones goes to town to find out more from the local community centre where a rural access grant pays a part-time salary to a drought relief coordinator who works 60 hours a week, but, unfortunately, the grant will end in June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jones has to wait a while until the community worker is free. The worker's logbook shows a daily personal workload of over 30 face-to-face calls and interviews for assistance and Mrs Jones notices that the phone never stops ringing. The community worker has bad news for Mrs Jones, and this news is what brings me to the section of the social security legislation that we are concentrating on at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jones is told that the government has tightened the assets test by a process called debt apportionment which means that some debt will be apportioned to the family home, even though their loan was to purchase additional land as a drought minimising strategy, following advice from their lender in the 1980s. The new arrangement sounds the death knell for Mrs Jones's hopes of accessing any benefits that would help her put food on the table that was not another loan. The community worker is sympathetic but harassed at the thought of telling so many that they will not be able to access JSA if this legislation goes through. The phone rings and it is the QIDC with an unclear answer on whether a client who has been receiving JSA for longer than nine months might still access a re-establishment grant. She asks: what if the client was only on JSA for nine months one year and wants to go back on JSA the following year for nine months? Would the client still qualify for a re-establishment grant? Someone will get back to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The phone rings again&mdash;this time it is a woman on JSA wanting to know why she can go on a pension at 60 but her husband cannot automatically get one, when a man who has been on JSA for 12 months and turns 60 will get a mature age pension and his wife will automatically get the pension. She feels discriminated against and wishes that her husband had gone onto JSA instead of her. The community worker sighs, remembering how the woman on the phone used to be the district's most efficient producer and Landcare advocate. Now her property is one of the worst degraded areas and is overrun with feral animals and woody weeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jones looks at her watch. The community worker turns back to her and writes out a fuel voucher so that Mrs Jones can afford the petrol for the trip home. The worker hands Mrs Jones another slip of paper which is good for credit at the local food store to the amount of $85. `That's all this month', she says, `and next month, we just don't know'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year there were 1,000 families depending on food parcels to survive in south-west Queensland.

In the first six months of the new RAS, there were 519 approvals for interest subsidies under normal circumstances. Temporary exceptional circumstances funding was introduced and took up a lot of the slack. But that finishes soon and the eligibility guidelines have been tightened anyway. The second thing the government expected was that between 6,000 and 7,000 farmers would finish their RAS contracts that year&mdash;1992-93. In November 1993, I asked what had happened to those 6,000 to 7,000 families no longer receiving RAS. I was told that the government does not monitor the affairs of farmers who are no longer in receipt of RAS support. I was told that for those who are not eligible for RAS, farm household support and other welfare programs are available.</PARA>

Graingrowers in Queensland have made heavy losses every year of the drought currently in its third devastating year. Thank God, as I make this speech, it is raining in Queensland. Over 50 per cent of Queensland was drought declared. So there are literally thousands in similar situations to the Joneses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues Senator Patterson and Senator Boswell in foreshadowing our opposition to clause 27 of this legislation, which will effectively lessen the likelihood of members of farm families getting social security benefits such as unemployment benefits and the pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in these recent years of rural recession, it has become necessary for many farmers and their families to apply for government assistance in the form of social security. In the period 1990-91, the average broadacre farm net equity was $734,886. For the same period the farm business profit for all broadacre farms was negative $24,838. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the following period we see the same pattern. In 1991-92 average broadacre farm net equity was $784,760, yet farm business profit was once again in the red at negative $23,810. The 1993 farm survey states that, on average, broadacre farms are expected to record a third consecutive year with business loss. All industries are expected to record lower average farm business profit in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While farms with high equity positions have, for the most part, been able to maintain their financial positions, farms with lower equity have seen a sharp reduction in their position over the past three years. Where farmers and their families are in the income and assets test levels placing them in the possible range for social security, as we have seen from the graphic illustration provided by Senator Boswell, this amendment could come into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a necessity for a level of debt in order that farmers maintain productivity. If farmers are to improve their income potential, even in bad times, as much money as possible needs to go back into the farm for fertiliser, fencing, the purchase of stud stock and machinery and the improvement of water resources. Most farmers are asset rich in terms of the land they hold, and yet they are income poor, as the average figures I quoted earlier will substantiate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as the earlier figures indicate, on average farmers are in debt. There is very little left over for personal use. Farmers' capacity for personal expenditure is very much reduced, and many must borrow in order to maintain the productivity of the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amending bill requires the Department of Social Security to apportion debt on the basis of what the borrowings are secured against. So if a farmer had taken out a loan for farm land, the Department of Social Security must now allocate a portion of this debt against the farmhouse. Therefore the government's method of debt apportionment would unfairly make a farm family's assets levels appear higher than they really are. Clearly all the farm debt should instead be offset against the farm assets in calculating eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's bill would mean that many farm families, and particularly farm women, would be ruled out for social security entitlements that they should be eligible for. Rural women, as part of farming families, have always worked in some capacity on the farm as wives, mothers, and as partners in the many and varied day-to-day tasks of farm life. But in recent years we have seen the movement of farm women into employment off the farm, and often at some geographical distance from it. They have embarked on this in order to supplement the farm income which, as I indicated earlier, has fallen dramatically in recent times. Many of these women are trained teachers, nurses or other professionals, and are able to return to their former careers. Others are not so fortunate. They must search for work, and often only find it after some time. They are just as deserving as urban women of the jobsearch allowance and yet, under this proposed legislation, they will be denied it because the asset level of the property has been artificially inflated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm women are the silent sufferers on farms when times are tough and income is scarce. It is appalling that the Department of Social Security could attempt to worsen this situation with this amendment, which would deny farm women their fair and legitimate entitlement to social security assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition view is that the assets test in relation to rural property owners should be revised in any case. The impact of this proposal is to impose a rigorous assets test on primary producer property owners who are already in necessitous circumstances. For this reason, the coalition opposes this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be opposing these clauses in their entirety. These clauses will create a debt to the Department of Social Security where payments are made under an AAT stay order and the AAT ultimately decides in the department's favour. As I pointed out during the second reading debate, payments made under a stay order of the SSAT do not become recoverable even when the SSAT decision is to affirm the original departmental decision. In the case of sole parent pensioners, payments up to the SSAT stage must continue to be paid while the appeal is being determined. These payments do not become debts either. So these clauses seek to implement different arrangements for payments made under an AAT stay order from those that will apply for payments under an SSAT order. Thus there will be an inconsistency introduced into the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns I have is that some time in the future the government will seek to remove that inconsistency by making payments made under an SSAT stay order recoverable as debts as well. It has to be remembered that for a stay to be granted people need to convince a member of the AAT of the merits of their case: that is, in the view of an AAT member there has to be at least some chance of the appeal being successful. Thus, when a stay is granted, the client is given the impression that the application is a valid one and proceeds on that basis, including the detailed preparation for the AAT hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum indicates that this measure is to have no budgetary effect. I suspect the reason for that is the very small number of people to be affected. I think the department estimated that there would be about 10 people subject to these provisions. While the overall budgetary effect is to be minimal, the effect on those 10 people could be quite significant, particularly in view of the fact that AAT hearings can often take several months to be concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may argue that if these clauses are defeated then we will be providing an incentive to people to pursue their appeals right through to the AAT stage in the knowledge that it will extend their payment period with no need to repay if the appeal is unsuccessful.

The department may claim that this provision is covered in its guidelines, but I believe it is preferable to have such provisions in the legislation as it gives more direction to senior officers and to appeals tribunals and more consistency throughout the system. </PARA>

However, we contend that the current assets test in relation to rural property is too harsh. I mentioned that in my speech on the second reading and my colleagues have expanded on that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats also oppose clause 27 for reasons given in my speech on second reading. We see the farm as a working asset and as such believe it should be exempt from the assets test. The government amendments contained in clause 27 of this bill seek to introduce a new formula to implement the apportionment rule for primary producers. We are not convinced by the government's argument. We are worried that, in fact, the overwhelming majority of farmers have been on the land for many years and will have paid off that part of their original loans that related to their houses&mdash;particularly in light of the fact that most farms have very modest houses on them, and that is only if the farmers have had a loan in the first place.

Indeed, figures from the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicate that virtually all new debt incurred by farmers is for farm business purposes only&mdash;that is, for the purchase of land or working capital for debt reconstruction or for the purchase of plant and livestock. I believe it is unfair for the department to assume that a certain portion of a primary producer's loan will be used to improve the farmer's house. For those reasons, we will vote against this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government certainly opposes removal of this clause from the bill. Both the Democrats and the opposition have failed to recognise that there are already special provisions under the assets test to take account of the particular circumstances of farmers. There are special hardship provisions in the assets test, directed mainly at assisting farmers. Farmers are also able to aggregate their farm assets and liabilities for the purposes of calculating assessable assets. The latter provision, confined only to farmers, enables an excess debt on a particular farm asset&mdash;for example, on a harvester&mdash;to be offset against the value of other farm producing assets. That is how the concession was first announced in 1991, and no other group gets this special concession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 does not alter this beneficial treatment of farmers. All it does is make more explicit in the legislation the existing policy that has been in place for many years. That policy requires that where some assets are exempt from the assets test&mdash;for example, the farmhouse on a farm&mdash;any debts relating to that exempt asset should not be allowed as a deduction. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable and equitable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one suggested in 1991 that liabilities related to exempt assets could be used to reduce the value of assessable assets. This amendment has actually arisen from an interpretation of the existing act by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which suggested that the current wording did not allow the apportioning formula that gives effect to this longstanding policy to apply to farm assets. This is where I think the opposition's hypocrisy is revealed. It argues that there should be no changes to the social security income and assets test pending the outcome of the current review. Then it says, `Let's knock off a simple technical amendment and change the policy'. I would like Senator MacGibbon to be listening at this point, and I hope he is. But this is not just simply a policy change because the opposition wants to scrap one of the basic principles of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, both the opposition and the Democrats would be scrapping that basic principle for just one group. It is quite clearly a change of policy and, much worse than that, it will cost about $15 million. If we had to consider the most equitable way to spend $15 million on assistance to farmers, this would certainly not be the way to do it. Under this amendment, farmers with the biggest houses would be the biggest winners. That is not a surprising policy perhaps for the opposition, because it is clearly just a piece of political opportunism by both the opposition and the Democrats. </PARA>

It is simply a lie to state that the provision will widen the assets test and exclude some rural farmers. </PARA>

The basic difference between farmers and other groups in the community&mdash;and this is a principle that the government is failing to appreciate time and again&mdash;is that at this point in history farmers' assets are providing them with no income whatsoever. Compared to other sectors, such as a person who owns a factory that could be described as an asset in the manufacturing sector, farmers' assets, their land, is providing them with no income.

The government is trying to ensure that people are not able to use wills to avoid the assets test. This possibility arose with an interpretation of the legislation by the SSAT. By refusing to allow even technical amendments to be made while the income and assets test review is under way the opposition seems to be prepared to condone avoidance of the assets test and to open up large holes in the existing provisions.

While they were not prepared to leave a hole in the assets test through the life interest provisions, they do seem to want to give a one-off windfall gain to a few individuals in this case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In our consideration of the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 we need to be aware that this is a budget bill to amend the Housing Assistance Act 1989 in accordance with the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Housing Assistance Act 1989 under which the states, with financial assistance from the Commonwealth, deliver housing assistance for rental housing and home purchase in accordance with the terms of the 1989 Commonwealth-state housing agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends section 7(3A) of the act, which section specifies appropriations made under the act, in particular those for 1993 to 1996. An amendment introduced in the other chamber belatedly by the government on 22 February this year has the effect of amending section 15 of the principal act. This amendment to the bill passed in the other chamber will have the effect of enabling the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state in 1994-95, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation for the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs. This is in accordance with paragraph 13(2)(b) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of the amendments to section 7(3A) of the act appropriates from the consolidated revenue fund $1,080,890,000 in respect of the fifth grant year of the act&mdash;that is, 1993-94. It appropriates $1,010,641,000 in respect of the sixth year of the act&mdash;that is, 1994-95. It also appropriates $1,017,863,000 in respect of the seventh year of the act&mdash;that is, 1995-96. The bill amends these appropriations to $1,042,390,000, $1,028,141,000 and $1,035,363,000 respectively. The financial impact of the bill is thus to decrease the appropriation of 1993-94 by $38,500,000, to increase the appropriation for 1994-95 by $17,500,000, and to increase the appropriation for 1995-96 by $17,500,000. The financial impact to the Commonwealth of new section 15(2A) and new section 15A will not result in any additional Commonwealth outlays. The amendments to section 7(3A) of the principal act are routine and non-controversial, and implement budget proposals announced for the financial years 1993-94 to 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced a slippage of funding due to unexpected funds from 1992-93 rolling over to this financial year and the carry forward of other funds into subsequent years. These changes have been endorsed by state and territory housing ministers. The amendments to section 15(2A) and new section 15A have been requested by some state governments which, under their various home purchase assistance programs, have not been able to meet the matching grant level required under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the principal act have been alluded to in meetings with the housing departmental officials prior to Christmas 1993. On 22 February 1993, these amendments were introduced in the other chamber. My office contacted the offices of the various state and territory ministers to ensure that the state and territory government housing ministers were aware that the Commonwealth was going to proceed with amendments of this nature to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there has been a definite lack of consultation on the part of the federal government, the amendments as passed by the other chamber appear to have the endorsement of state and territory governments. My office was advised of these particular amendments that related just to the new amendments to the legislation only several hours prior to the legislation being debated in the chamber. I do not think the Australian Democrats were even given that particular courtesy with regard to this legislation. Therefore, the government must accept the criticism that it has attempted to bring in new amendments at the 11th hour. It is simply unreasonable and arrogant for the Labor government to expect same day delivery on those principled amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally the coalition does not have a problem with the government introducing amendments to its own flawed legislation. However, we take exception to this rule when, first, the government had the Housing Assistance Amendment Bill sitting on its books in the other chamber for six months; secondly, there is an introduction of amendments to the bill which do not amend the content of the bill but are principled changes to the nature of the Commonwealth-state housing agreements; thirdly, courtesies are extended to the Labor caucus and cleared by caucus but the same courtesies are not extended to the Liberal and National parties, the shadow ministry, party room and back-bench committees, and, I am sure, to the Australian Democrats, the Greens and other independents in this parliament&mdash;I believe similar consideration for party debate was not extended in any way in this area&mdash;fourthly, the federal government does not even consult with the state minister and housing officials to advise that these amendments are to be implemented in the legislation, particularly when the amendments have major implications for the state budgetary processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officers of state housing ministers alerted my office of their apprehensions prior to the debate in the other chamber, citing the fact that they had not seen copies of the amendments or explanatory memoranda accompanying the amendments. These officers were also of the opinion that this matter was to be on the agenda for the consideration of the Commonwealth-state housing ministers conference, which, as we all know, was held last Monday&mdash;a date some time after the amendments were foisted through the House of Representatives. I am highly critical of the federal government's handling of the housing portfolio. It has failed dismally in the provision of public housing, and this is after a decade&mdash;10 years&mdash;in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's commentary on aspects of the Commonwealth-state housing agreements, which was tabled on 31 September 1993, contains damning comment on housing policy under the federal Labor government and the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, Mr Howe. After a decade of Labor administration, the efficiency and accountability of the Commonwealth-state housing agreements should be beyond question. I would have thought that the emphasis for any minister for housing would be such that we would see less of the sort of trenchant criticism that is now being expressed by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 6</EMPHASIS> of 1993-94, to which I have just referred, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One aspect that is frequently overlooked by departments and agencies is the need for clear identification, measurement and reporting of Commonwealth obligations of exposure under the agreement. In the case of housing, for example, data currently available to the department is insufficient to determine both the true levels of subsidies provided under the various housing assistance schemes and the overall exposure of the Commonwealth under its obligations to meet any shortfalls in the operation of those schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>These comments compounded criticisms made earlier in the National Audit Office report No. 1 of 1993-94. In that report the Auditor-General's comments in the area of housing and planning were very scary, and drew attention to a range of issues and agreements between the Commonwealth and state governments that needed addressing in the performance of the Commonwealth-state housing agreements. The issue that the Auditor-General has now acknowledged leads us to question where is housing in Australia. What rules, regulations and arrangements between Commonwealth and state housing ministers have been put in place? I cannot stress how alarmed I was when I questioned officers of the former Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services at the September-October 1993 Senate estimates committee hearings. The departmental officers admitted they had not responded to the recommendations with any degree of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The billions of dollars of Commonwealth money injected into public housing makes this an important issue to people with housing needs throughout Australia. If the federal government is going to walk away and not acknowledge any of the issues that are put under its nose by the Auditor-General on accountability, efficiency and effective performance indicators, we are in desperate and dire straits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report into public housing was established on 5 November 1993 by Treasurer John Dawkins. The draft Industry Commission report was released on 6 August 1993, and that also was a shocking report card on Labor's housing record. The final report, which was released on 13 January 1994, unfortunately, was not much better. The Industry Commission report is a critical indictment of existing public housing arrangements and highlights the urgent need for action. Its focus on people on low incomes or with disabilities, homeless youth, women escaping domestic violence and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people reveals the compounding relationship between unemployment and housing needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A joint statement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), and the Assistant Treasurer(Mr Gear), commenting on the Industry Commission's report, indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission concludes that more transparent funding and institutional arrangements and greater clarity in the objectives and responsibilities of Commonwealth and State/territory governments, will be necessary to enable the optimum mix of assistance measures to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers said that the specific changes recommended by the Commission form a closely inter-related package which if adopted would see a significant change in the respective roles of the Commonwealth and State/ Territories and to present funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>However, despite the ministers' statements, I am concerned at the muzzling of the Industry Commission's recommendation on accountability. In the August draft report, recommendation 1 stated that governments should clarify their housing objectives to ensure that they are operational. Recommendation 2 was that housing assistance should be provided under arrangements which promote transparency and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final report, these recommendations appear to have slipped seriously in priority order&mdash;no doubt with subtle intervention by the ministers involved and perhaps some departmental officers&mdash;and have become mere suggestions. I fail to see why the federal government has not taken valid accountability criticisms on board and addressed these flaws. After all, if the government can snap its fingers and secure amendments relating to exemptions for state government home purchase assistance programs when they are unable to match grant level funding required by the Commonwealth under this act, then correct accountability, transparency and institutional arrangements should also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer arrogance of the government in not taking valid criticism from both the Auditor-General and the Industry Commission and putting it into action shows how it has a total disregard for the public purse. The ministers have publicly acknowledged the federal Labor government will not respond to the Industry Commission's recommendations until June 1994. Ironically, that is a month after the May 1994 budget, given  that they have had a draft report sitting on their desk since August of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has absolutely no ability to address the problems raised by the Industry Commission. The areas that need to be addressed urgently by this government include: expenditure to promote and facilitate community housing; housing assistance for people in crisis; supported accommodation assistance program and crisis accommodation program; funding to modify community housing to meet special needs of people with disabilities; housing problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and rent assistance measures for tenants in the private rental market so that it, firstly, declines as income increases, secondly, it is important that it is available to all low income tenants in the private rental markets and, thirdly, is brought closer to rent rebates in the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have a right to know what this elected government is going to provide in the form of housing assistance. The recommendations will affect over one million low income households in Australia receiving housing assistance from the Commonwealth and state governments.

Many of these families have a father, mother, brother, sister, aunt, uncle or some other unemployed relative. There are nearly one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's report is a critical indictment of existing housing arrangements and highlights the need for urgent action in some specific areas. Labor's recession has adversely affected large sectors of the Australian community. The Industry Commission acknowledged that many people have difficulty assessing appropriate and affordable housing including: people with disabilities; elderly people; young people; women and children escaping domestic violence and family breakdown; sole parents; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and migrants. The fact that the Industry Commission reveals that many needy people have fallen outside the traditional safety nets and government spending priorities shows the compounding relationship between unemployment and housing needs&mdash;sadly, an issue which obviously the Labor government has walked away from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill adjusts the amounts to be appropriated from consolidated revenue from 1993 to 1996 for the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The Democrats support this bill and also the amendments, but  wish to comment further, as Senator Tambling has done, about the late arrival of those amendments. The Democrats also were not able to see them before the time originally set for this debate. They are readily available now, but we must remember that this bill was originally listed some time ago. It was very much at the last minute that we were able to see those amendments, which quite significantly alter the thrust of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst supporting the legislation, I take this opportunity to stress that the Democrats do not support the general thrust of this government's housing policies and look particularly at the urgent need for government to address problems of housing for the mentally ill, housing for Australians with psychiatric disability, victims of domestic violence and in particular the growing number of young people, many of whom may not officially be on any homeless list but are squatting with friends, moving between relatives, and are effectively without a home that they can call their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some good pieces of news on the housing front, particularly the affordability index. It is at its highest level since the December quarter of 1984 for those people who are in a regular, secure, reasonably well-paid job. But that does nothing for those people&mdash;and there are huge numbers of them&mdash;on the public housing waiting lists. The housing lists in my state of South Australia are a disgrace. There are well over 42,000 people on the list, and that does not mean just individuals, but in many cases families are represented in that figure. In yesterday's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> the South Australian housing minister, Mr Oswald, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years ago there had been 3,000 public housing starts in SA. Last year it went down to about 600 and next year "we were looking at about 400".</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia cannot undo the mess it is in on its own as far as public housing is concerned. This legislation certainly has the potential to have an impact on that, but without some real will on the part of this government, very little can be done. We await with interest to see what will come out of the budget and what additional moneys will be made available to ensure that the number of housing starts goes up considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest available data contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Welfare 1993&mdash;Services and Assistance</EMPHASIS> shows that one out of every 10 Australians was in housing need in the early 1990s and that, in particular, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, young people and single parent families&mdash;and most of those single parent families are women&mdash;are in the greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public and community housing is widely recognised as the most cost effective way of providing low cost housing. A recent cost benefit analysis by National Shelter demonstrates that there are measurable economic benefits which flow from public housing. They include: a reduction in poverty due to effective assistance to people on low incomes; the provision of basic human needs; lower inflation by lowering demand pressures at the lower end of the private rental market; stabilisation of cyclical activity in the building industry; higher employment; and security of tenure for tenants. In its budget submission, National Shelter argues that the government must provide additional resources for public and community housing so that commencements can go up from 10,000 to around 30,000 per year. As it is the peak umbrella organisation in Australia, I hope that the government is listening to its requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are aware of the difficulties in defining the levels of homelessness, but the estimates of the number of young people who are homeless, at risk of becoming homeless, or in situations where they have no security of tenure and do not have a place to call their own, is at least 50,000. If we look at the implications of this for their physical wellbeing as well as the activities that these young people undertake&mdash;very few of them are able to continue with formal education&mdash;we see that it is not just a matter of providing housing that the government needs to look at in its economic analysis, but all the other costs that are going to have to be borne by government in later years if these young people are not adequately catered for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burdekin report on human rights and mental illness highlights the need for increased access to supported accommodation for people with mental illness and for those with psychiatric disabilities. It stresses that these people should have priority of access under state housing authority agreements. This report also calls for better trained staff, increased resources for respite care and appropriate licensing and regulation of boarding houses and special accommodation facilities. In its response to the Burdekin report the government proposes to do a range of things. It will be looking at a national review of all Commonwealth, state and territory legislation, et cetera, but I ask the minister when we will see some action rather than a simple list of promises. Yes, the government will do it, but we need to know when the government is going to take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats consider the provision of affordable and appropriate housing a basic right, especially with regard to meeting the housing needs of disadvantaged groups. The recommendations raised in the Industry Commission report require action. The issues highlighted in the Burdekin report require action. It is not enough for government to say that housing is a key priority and yet do absolutely nothing about it in financial terms. We need action. It is unfortunate that, despite the fact that this bill has been around for six months, those amendments were so late. As I mentioned before, it is something that we hope does not happen again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to cover a couple of points that were raised by Senator Tambling and one matter raised by Senator Lees. I thank opposition members and Democrats who have spoken in this debate for their support for this legislation, although, as is usual, there was a fair amount of criticism on the way through, but I will attempt to deal with those criticisms now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's reports were referred to by Senator Tambling. It has been suggested that there has been a lack of response to Audit Report No. 1 of 1993-94. That claim is not true; the Commonwealth has responded. Cash management arrangements introduced in October 1992 have identified some anomalies in information provided by states and these have  been followed up with the states by the Department of Human Services and Health. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure more timely submissions of financial returns by the states. A set of performance measures and related data requirements are being developed in conjunction with the states. These will facilitate the evaluation of performance against national housing objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth and state officials are undertaking a review of home purchase assistance arrangements provisions of the CSHA. Joint policy development work with the states is also under way to address issues raised by the recent Industry Commission report, and this work includes measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness of housing service delivery. Reference was also made to Audit Report No. 6. Two matters on page 26 of that report were referred to. The questions of performance measurement and information requirements are being addressed as part of the joint policy work being undertaken with the states in responding to the Industry Commission report and in a review of the home purchase assistance provisions. Changes to be implemented in these areas will address issues raised by the Industry Commission as well as the ANAO concerning transparency in the costs of providing housing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the suggestion of Commonwealth exposure in respect of meeting any shortfalls in the operation of home purchase assistance schemes would seem to be based on a misunderstanding of the CSHA. The detailed design and operation of these schemes are a state responsibility, and the CSHA does not place any obligation on the Commonwealth to meet any shortfalls in their operation. Finally, on the audit report, the government agrees that the Auditor-General has provided sound advice on the introduction of prudent cash management. There need be no concern that an opportunity for improved cash management and savings has been ignored. In fact, it should be noted that the recommended practice was adopted under the CSHA in October 1992, well before this audit recommendation was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some criticism concerning consultation with states and territories about the amendments and about their introduction so late that apparently opposition and Democrat senators only saw them very late in the time frame for this legislation. In September last year the minister for housing met with housing ministers from New South Wales and Victoria. They asked him to address the difficulties they were experiencing in meeting their home purchase assistance matching obligations under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The minister was also subsequently asked for similar consideration by the Tasmanian housing minister. As was explained to the parliament in the other place in the recent debate, the minister acted on these requests by seeking a legislative amendment to the Housing Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing committee of Commonwealth-state housing officials, which has representation from all state and territory housing departments and which considers housing policy and program issues, has discussed the matching issue on several occasions. At the most recent meeting on 1 February this year, the committee was advised that the Commonwealth would be pursuing a legislative amendment to address the difficulties of the states. The minister's office met with the shadow minister for housing on the same day that the approval to proceed with the legislation was given by caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has claimed that state ministers expected to view the legislation at a ministerial council meeting last week. Minister Howe met with the state and territory housing ministers at the ministerial council on Monday and advised them that the Commonwealth was pursuing a legislative amendment. No concerns were expressed about this action. Some state ministers have purportedly indicated to the shadow minister's offices that they were quite happy with the legislation proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees raised a matter in respect to the Burdekin report. The minister referred to that matter in a press release of 28 February. Senator Lees sought an indication from me on the provision of a time frame. I cannot give that to the honourable senator. I do not think she will be surprised that I cannot give her that assurance&mdash;we really have to be a little realistic. The minister's public statement on this matter was only two days ago, on 28 February. It is very difficult to give an ironclad time frame on this matter or many other matters in the government policy process. That is not any deliberate evasion; there are heavy schedules, workloads, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill establish a legislative framework that enables Australia to comply with a resolution of the United Nations Security Council establishing an international war crimes tribunal for the prosecution of crimes arising from the ongoing conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last parliamentary session, the government announced that it would try to issue a list of bills that would be introduced in this session for passage in the next or to highlight at the beginning the ones that were to be dealt with in this session. As I understand it, these bills were not on that list. I am not sure whether that was the case. I see one of the advisers looking a bit startled, so perhaps the bills were on that list. However, in any event, these bills appear to be rushed, and there may well be good reason for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the bills is that in May 1993 the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution establishing an international tribunal which had as its sole purpose prosecuting persons that were adjudged to be responsible for serious violations of international law committed in the former Yugoslavia. The resolution adopted the statute of the international tribunal which details the competence, jurisdiction, powers, composition and procedures of that tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution was taken under chapter 7 of the charter of the United Nations which concerns actions with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Resolutions taken by the Security Council pursuant to that chapter are mandatory and binding on members of the United Nations. Pursuant to the terms of the resolution Australia, along with other member countries, has an obligation under international law to cooperate with the tribunal and take measures under domestic law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, article 29 of the statute provides: first, states shall cooperate with the international tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of committing serious violations of international humanitarian law; and, second, states shall comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a trial at chamber including but not limited to the identification and location of persons, the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, the arrest or detention of persons, and the surrender or the transfer of the accused to the international tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the bill is trying to do is allow us to fulfil those obligations and give us the capacity to do so. It is interesting to note that Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Governor-General and High Court judge of Australia, has been appointed as one of the 11 judges of the tribunal by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and that Mr Graham Blewitt, who formerly directed the Australian war crimes special investigation unit and the war crimes prosecution support unit has, as I understand it, been appointed a deputy prosecutor to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech of the bill indicates that one of the intentions is that the bill should be kept as simple, minimalist and as clean and easy to understand as possible. Without wanting to be carping, I must say that it does not appear necessarily to have achieved that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of the bill allows the tribunal to make a request for assistance to the Attorney. Part 3 establishes a mechanism that allows for the surrender of persons to the tribunal. The provisions therein are modelled on the Extradition Act of 1988, but the discretion of the executive that exists in the Extradition Act of 1988 is somewhat curtailed in this bill&mdash;that is, the discretion of the executive to refuse a request by the tribunal is much more limited than in the Extradition Act. That is because of our international obligation to hand over someone to the tribunal, and that obligation is absolute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the bill does provide a discretion for the Attorney-General to refuse to surrender a person to the tribunal does, therefore, have potential to cause us some embarrassment. Perhaps the minister, when he is responding, may care to make some remarks about that point. As we understand the situation, our obligations are absolute. So why does there need to be any discretion in the Attorney not to hand over? Does that not mean that we are not accepting an absolute obligation to hand over, and does that not allow for some potential embarrassment? There may be a simple explanation that has not occurred to us. In the event, we would be grateful if the minister could give some indication about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the commentators who contributed to the consultations on this bill with the shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams QC, put it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One could imagine the pressures that might be exerted by different segments of the community for or against surrender of a particular person accused of war crimes. Rumour has it that the government had second thoughts about an Australian serving as a member of the tribunal because of the potentially divisive effects of the trials within the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A similar case could be made against the government retaining a discretion under the bill to refuse to surrender an accused.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a technical point in relation to sections 9 and 10 in part 3 of the bill, of which there may be some explanation. These provisions relate to the procedures applicable before an Australian magistrate can issue a warrant for a person's arrest to facilitate his or her surrender to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a normal case the issue of a warrant by the magistrate must be conditioned by receipt by the Attorney-General of a warrant issued by the tribunal, together with a request from the tribunal that the person be surrendered. However a provision is also made that in cases of urgency the magistrate may issue the warrant where a warrant has been received from the tribunal, but no request for surrender has been received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this procedure is not immediately obvious. It is not easy to envisage where the tribunal will have the time, capacity, reason et cetera to issue a warrant, but not to issue a request for surrender. Perhaps in the Minister's response there may be some explanation of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked in the explanatory memorandum, which regrettably I have not brought with me, and all it says is, `This clause deals with the issue of the warrant for surrender'. It does not actually explain why there are two limbs to clause 10. It is the second limb of clause 10, as I recall, that contains this provision for the matter to be dealt with differently in an emergency. All we ask is for some explanation of how there can be an urgency if a warrant can be issued by the tribunal but not a request for surrender. I look forward to hearing any comments the government might wish to make with respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 deals with other forms of assistance to the tribunal, including the taking of evidence and production of documents in Australia, search and seizure of evidentiary material in this country, evidence at hearings and so on. In relation to that and part 6, the provisions closely follow the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, 1987. It might be worth remarking&mdash;which I had not thus done&mdash;that we will support the bill, and at this stage do not have any amendments to move. But, as I understand it, the bill is being referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had occasion last week to make reference to that committee. The chairman, Mr Daryl Melham, was proudly announcing that it was the premier committee of the parliament&mdash;not just of the House of Representatives, but of the parliament. I found that rather amusing, being on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the Senate, which does most of the work in the whole of this place. It has not done a bad job, works on a pretty bipartisan basis, and has been very effective for a number of years in addressing both the technical issues in bills and issues in the community. But nonetheless we are all entitled to our dreams, and Mr Melham is no exception in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actually, Mr Melham has had a win. In fact, I was able to inform him of it, and he seemed a bit surprised. As I understand it, the government has agreed that this bill will be referred to the committee in the lower place. There is a temptation to say, `We will have it too'. Then we would have a good comparison of what the other place did and what we did. We all know who would be judged the better, but that might be judged to be a waste of taxpayers' money. So we will just wait and see what the House of Representatives committee has to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt two of the matters that the committee will be addressing are those matters I have raised: the potential embarrassment by there being some opportunity for the Attorney-General to not pass someone over, and also the different procedure where there is an emergency, and some explanation for what that emergency might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have said, with respect to this, that this process is just an empty vessel, a gesture at looking good to somehow pass off the world's guilt for the fact that the processes we have set up internationally are not being effective in stopping all the atrocities that have occurred and perhaps are still occurring in that part of the world and elsewhere. Although, as we are informed, the possibility of prosecutions might not be as remote as those people would think, and we are happy to support a commitment to pursuing people who engage in those sorts of completely unacceptable activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that there is good evidence for prosecutions being launched against a number of people already. In fact, we understand that in Germany a high-ranking suspected war criminal is already in custody. So that is a good thing, if the tribunal finds that the person is guilty. It is perhaps not such a good thing if it finds that the person is not guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On both sides of the dispute there are Croats who hold in custody Serbs who are accused of war crimes, and the other way around. Those detainees may potentially be surrendered to the tribunal. Our role is not expected to be very substantial. The bill is only likely to be utilised occasionally, and most likely in the context of simply surrendering suspects to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis we are happy to support the bill, but we do believe that some of the technical matters need to be looked at. It is a very serious matter to agree to pass up our own citizens into someone else's jurisdiction and when we cannot rule out the prospect that it may in fact be our own citizens that we will be called upon to do that with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the bill deserves very close scrutiny to make sure that the procedures that are being put in place are the proper procedures, and that with all good intentions we are not somehow putting our citizens unfairly at risk&mdash;a risk that we would not put them at were we to have control of the matter. On that point I will conclude and look forward to hearing what Senator Spindler has to say and then the government's response to those two points that I raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and related consequential legislation. The bill is a welcome attempt to give effect to the obligations that were imposed by the United Nations Security Council when it adopted resolution 827 on 25 May 1993. That resolution is based on chapter VII of the United Nations charter under which the security council is given mandatory powers to determine a threat or breach of the peace and to take measures to restore international security and peace. Article 25 of the United Nations charter obliges member states to cooperate and hence to override or amend provisions in national constitutions which may slow down the capture and surrender of their nationals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, the action taken by the United Nations in resolution 827 is quite radical. It represents a move away from trying to get the agreement of the world community to the establishment of an international body to deal with all allegations of war crimes. That process has been going on since the Nuremberg trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the United Nations has acted to set up an ad hoc tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting those responsible for serious violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991. As Sir David Hannay, the British Ambassador to the United Nations, said at the time of the resolution it is `an exceptional step needed to deal with exceptional circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I will comment briefly on the point made by Senator Vanstone. She said that these measures possibly are being taken to assuage our consciences because the world community at large has seen fit not to intervene in Bosnia and prevent the genocidal atrocious activities that have proceeded there and are still continuing. I wish to put on record my personal opinion that the failure of the world community, the European community, the United States, other countries and the United Nations as a whole to not intervene militarily in that particular situation is to be deplored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it will affect detrimentally the future activities and status of the United Nations as a peacemaking as well as a peacekeeping body.

It should be recognised by all and sundry&mdash;all countries&mdash;that the world community will not tolerate genocidal, murderous activities and that there is enough resolve and enough money to show that, although many of the nations that subscribe to the UN principles have failed and are failing to make their contributions. </PARA>

But I do realise that even if we said action should be taken and we in Australia were prepared to contribute our share, it is unlikely to overcome the obvious reluctance expressed by the European Community, by the United States and by other countries. I know the arguments against it. People are saying that to pacify the warring factions militarily in what used to be the state of Yugoslavia would take 500,000 personnel and we would have to commit them for 10 years or so. I know that that is the case. What I am saying is taking that into account. I think we are dealing with an exceptional situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator O'Chee's support on that point. I return to the bill. The Australian Democrats welcome and support the main thrust of the legislation. The setting up of the tribunal sends a clear message to all in the former Yugoslavia that they must immediately stop violations of international humanitarian law or face the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drawing upon the legislative framework suggested by the Extradition Act and the Mutual Assistance Act, the bill firstly gives legislative recognition to the international tribunal that has been set up to deal with the Yugoslavian war crimes. As Senator Vanstone said, Sir Ninian Stephen has been appointed to the panel of judges. I think, in view of Sir Ninian's distinguished record as a jurist and as a former Governor-General, it is pleasing to see that he has seen fit to accept that appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it provides mechanisms by which those people who may be resident in Australia and who are to be prosecuted by the tribunal can be arrested and surrendered to the tribunal. Thirdly, it also allows for the Attorney-General to make arrangements for witnesses to appear before the tribunal. Fourthly, it allows the tribunal to sit in Australia to take evidence. Fifthly, it allows for Australian authorities to assist in the gathering of evidence. And, sixthly, it enables forfeiture orders made by the tribunal to be enforced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Democrats support these provisions in the main. However, there are areas of the bill where amendments are needed to improve procedural fairness and to protect the rights of individuals. These areas of concern will be taken up in more detail later in the committee stage but I will flag some of them now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two main areas of concern. One is in the surrender of persons to the tribunal. The surrender mechanisms set out in part 3 of the bill allow for the issuing of warrants and for the arrest of the person named in the warrant. This issuing of a warrant may occur either when a notice from the tribunal has been received by the Attorney-General or when the Attorney-General requests a magistrate to issue a warrant in the expectation that such a notice will be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once a person is arrested that person may be either remanded in custody or granted bail. If a notice from the tribunal has been received, the Attorney-General must then make a determination as to whether or not the person is to be surrendered. Section 16 requires the Attorney-General to order the surrender of the person unless there are `exceptional circumstances'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the bill presently stands, there is no statutory right vested in the person who is to be delivered to make submissions to the Attorney-General on the matter of exceptional circumstances which might stop the Attorney-General from delivering that person. There is no right vested in the person to know the allegations made against him or her. I find that quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill there is no statutory definition of exceptional circumstances; there is only a statement that in exceptional circumstances the Attorney-General may decide not to surrender the person. Further, there is no court involvement in the determination of whether a person is to be surrendered; it is purely an executive decision. There are no rights of appeal. The Attorney-General's decision is not subject to review under the ADJR Act. There is no recognition of the time served by an Australian prisoner when he or she is surrendered to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully appreciate that these are exceptional provisions and that we do not wish to pass into law provisions which might lead to a person not being delivered to a war crimes tribunal and which might contribute to that person escaping. All honourable senators and the community at large would want war criminals punished and the prosecution of people charged to proceed as quickly and as effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of these considerations, all of which I support, I still feel that it behoves us not to ignore the normal safeguards that a civilised nation would expect to have in its judicial process. Clearly a balance has to be struck. Because of the extraordinary circumstances, it may be that in one or two areas we are prepared, and perhaps should be prepared, to relax a little the safeguards that we follow to ensure that they are available to accused persons in our adversarial legal system. Nevertheless, it is a weighty step to take to diminish these rights, even in these circumstances, and it should be carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from discussions that we have had with the government that it will agree to the amendments I will move that will require the person arrested to be given a written outline of the offence that he or she has allegedly committed and the conduct constituting that offence. I believe the government has also agreed to an amendment that I will move that will give recognition to the time spent in the tribunal's custody as time spent in serving an Australian sentence. The other concerns that I have outlined are still under consideration, in recognition of the fact that there is a balance is to be struck; however, I think that they will lead to some further Democrat amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has some connection to the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Bill, again in respect of which the Australian Democrats will be moving a large number of amendments with the intention of circumscribing police powers in the context of arrest, detention, search and seizure. Part 7 of the war crimes bill lifts provisions of the crimes bill into this bill. The Democrats acknowledge that as far as possible there should be legislative uniformity in this area; hence a final position on part 7 of this bill can be indicated by the Democrats only when the outcome of the debate on the Crimes Act amendments is known. I understand it is for that reason that the Senate will not be proceeding to the committee stage of this bill today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a particular interest in the former Yugoslavia as I competed in sport against a number of very fine gentlemen from Sarajevo&mdash;one of whom is now dead, killed by a mortar shell. The world is thoroughly repulsed by the inhuman, perverted and disgusting acts which have been committed in the former territory of Yugoslavia. I believe the world must take action to ensure that these things are not perpetuated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a supporter of the concept of a permanent court of international jurisdiction. However, I agree with many of the concerns outlined by my colleagues Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler that, just because we are repulsed by what we see, we should not necessarily rush into action which may be precipitous. I particularly agree with the concerns that Senator Vanstone has raised that some of the individuals who might be asked to be surrendered may be Australian citizens. That may seem strange to people who are not closely following the issue but, for one reason or another, many Australians have gone to the former territories of Yugoslavia and many of them are fighting in one force or another and, therefore, should they be suspected of committing an offence, they would be possible candidates for surrender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always an obligation on a sovereign state to look to protect the interests of its nationals when they are sought for proceedings of this nature. That is one of the obligations of a sovereign state in international law. It has been said that the provisions of this bill are extraordinary measures. They are extraordinary measures because it is an ad hoc tribunal. The point is that we should be very careful in not opposing the second passage of this bill to ensure that in no way are we taken to be assenting to these particular provisions being subsumed into customary international law should another ad hoc tribunal be set up at another time to deal with possible international crimes in another area. Nor should we be seen to be assenting to similar provisions which would come into effect in the event that there is a permanent court of international jurisdiction on criminal matters. These provisions must be clearly understood to be extraordinary measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I support the concerns that Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler have raised about matters that must be dealt with in the committee stage. However, I would be failing in my duty if I did not express my concerns at this point in time so that everybody understands the exact consequences of the passage of the bill. Some years ago I advocated that Australia claim jurisdiction in terrorist matters where Australians had been killed by terrorists overseas and to claim the power to try those terrorists in Australia&mdash;a power which the United States claims. The government responded by saying that it had jurisdictional concerns about that lest other states attempt to claim jurisdiction over Australians for acts which they have committed overseas or in Australia. I know that the two are not entirely analogous, but it must be recognised that there are similarities in terms of jurisdiction; that we have an obligation as a sovereign state to protect the rights of individuals; but, at the same time, that we do not wish to become a latter day Paraguay and be a haven for war criminals. That is why the second reading of this bill will not be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions in the debate on the international war crimes bills. Senator Vanstone, on behalf of the opposition, touched on two matters to which I will respond. In outlining those two issues, she firstly expressed concern at what she perceived as the rush in getting this legislation into the Senate today. I do not know what Senator Vanstone's understanding was, however, the program has been proceeding very smoothly this week and that very smoothness is the only reason we are dealing with it earlier than she may have anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Vanstone made some comments about a colleague of mine in the other place, Mr Daryl Melham. He is a very intelligent, diligent and hardworking member; one of our finest on the back bench. He certainly projects that diligence, hard work and intelligence quite freely, as he should project it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept what Senator O'Chee says; I am sure Mr Melham will be a future frontbencher in this very longstanding government, as it continues to win election after election. He is the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs where, as has been noted in this debate, this matter is to be referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone raised two matters. The first matter is: why retain a discretion to refuse? Apparently, the mere presence of a discretion does not of itself mean that Australia's obligations will not be adhered to. However, there may well be exceptional circumstances, such as humanitarian grounds, that would warrant refusing surrender&mdash;for example, a case where a defendant was suffering from a terminal illness with only a few months to live. It would clearly be unconscionable to surrender in such a case. But it must be stressed that it is only in such circumstance that the Attorney-General would exercise such a discretion. The bill seeks to find the appropriate balance between adhering to our international obligations and providing safeguards to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter relates to the issue of an arrest warrant without receipt of notice from the Attorney-General. The situation parallels the provisional arrest procedures under the Extradition Act. It may be necessary to seek to detain a person before he or she leaves the jurisdiction. It may be necessary to seek an arrest warrant as a matter of urgency in such circumstances. The urgency may be such as to prevent the issue of a notice by the Attorney-General under section 9 in sufficient time to reach the magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are additional concerns or points that Senator Vanstone requires clarification on, I will certainly speak to the Attorney-General and I am sure the matters will be taken up in the legal and constitutional affairs committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, both Senator Spindler and Senator O'Chee expressed their extreme concern at what has occurred in Yugoslavia. I agree with their sentiments very strongly. I am personally quite appalled at what has occurred in Yugoslavia over the last few years. I have had the opportunity to travel through that part of Yugoslavia that is now a war zone. With memories of a very enjoyable holiday in that part of Yugoslavia, to see it today turned into a war zone with the various atrocities that are occurring really does appal me. Certainly, I share Senator Spindler's concern at the failure of the United Nations to act in a more decisive manner to bring to an end the violence that is occurring in Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that, in an area of the world which certainly prides and, at times, boasts of its relative civilisation&mdash;that is, Europe&mdash;these sorts of atrocities and this warfare can occur without, again, the active intervention of the various European countries in seeking to bring to an end that violence, together with the United Nations.

<PARA>The National Health and Medical Research Council was founded 58 years ago and became a statutory authority last year. I do not think there is any body within the medical world that has had such a proud record of achievement in that 58 years. It has been an advisory group to government and has been responsible for the disbursement of research funds over that period. It has a very proud record throughout this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its current report the major issues are as follows: inequalities in health status; improving the understanding of chronic conditions; ageing; environmental health; national health goals and targets; and research. Principally, I wish to comment on the inequalities in health status and this links with another document that comes later. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the development of an Aboriginal health research program. Under this program the funds for health and medical research are paid to the Aboriginal community which is party to the research. This allows the community to negotiate on matters such as its aspirations from the research, ethical aspects of the research and the transfer of research skills to members of the community. Lengthy consultations were essential in the development of this program which has attracted research funding of $366,398 for 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal community has enormous health problems. The number of Aboriginals in Australia is estimated to be 1.2 per cent of the population. The life expectancy for an Aboriginal male is 22 years less than the non-Aboriginal average and for an Aboriginal female, it is 15 years less than the non-Aboriginal average. The Aboriginal life expectancy rate is similar to that found in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not entirely due to neglect. Aboriginals have great problems with diabetes&mdash;the rate is 10 times the Australian average. Circulatory system disease, respiratory disease, ear diseases, eye disorders, cancer, urinary tract disease, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases are much higher than the Australian average. In fact, tuberculosis is 20 times more common in the Australian Aborigine than it is in the non-Aboriginal population. So there is a significant need for this allocation of research. My concern in some respects is that this allocation gets through to the researchers and does not get diffused into the non-Aboriginal community or in the bureaucracy. Already Australia devotes over $1,000,000,000 to the Aboriginal community and it would be a tragedy if these funds were not used in the appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of research I want to allude to is that the National Health and Medical Research Council says it has recognised the need to strengthen the discipline of health economics in Australia. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, that one great growth area in employment in Australia is in health economists. I have never seen the degree to which they have achieved as in recent years. It really has been brought about by the government's desire to ration health care in Australia. This has meant the need for more health economists and their analyses in trying to restrict the amount of health care funding. I find that an interesting characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains information on maternal morbidity for 1988-90. It found an increasing and unacceptably high rate of maternal deaths among Aboriginal women, with a high proportion of avoidable deaths. I will be interested to see what the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) is going to do about that. He has grandstanded all over the place regarding what he is going to do about Aboriginal health. Labor has been in government for 10 years. As I say, it is interesting that the report says there is an increasing and unacceptably high rate of maternal deaths among Aboriginal women. I will be interested to see in 12 months time what the report states in relation to this matter and how much the minister has achieved in that period. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>As a member of the Senate print media inquiry, I have had the opportunity to examine the modus operandi of the Foreign Investment Review Board in connection with one major foreign investment transaction&mdash;that is, the 1991 and 1993 applications by Conrad Black's Tourang consortium for the purchase and subsequent increase in ownership of John Fairfax Ltd.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inappropriate to canvass the future report to the Senate on FIRB's controversial performance on this occasion. However, I do wish to comment on the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FIRB is a non-statutory advisory body comprising three paid advisers and an executive officer who is a Treasury official. It is the agency which provides the Treasurer with advice on what is in `the national interest' required under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act which covers the acquisition of shares by overseas interests.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this act there can be no purchase of shares if the result would be contrary to the national interest. The previous requirement was for a foreign investment to be of net economic benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main functions of the board are to examine proposals by foreign interests for investment in Australia and to make recommendations to the Treasurer on the requirements of the legislation. In particular, it is to advise the government on foreign investment generally; to foster awareness both at home and overseas of the government's policy on foreign investment; and to provide guidance to potential foreign investors in the case of proposals which might not be in conformity with government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the examination of FIRB's two executive officers, this statutory body appears to lack direction and is completely over-worked. I see from the report that it had 3,825 proposals for investment in Australia. Of those, 3,602 were approved, with 2,268 conditions. With about 20 employees and, I understand, burdened with over 40,000 phone calls a year, one can see this very important body is completely over-worked. Clearly, FIRB's powers of investigation are limited and its power to enforce the conditions it sets on a foreign buyer are really unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FIRB's biggest problem is its total lack of public accountability. I am afraid to say the public face of FIRB that we have seen is straight out of the text of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. The print media inquiry has shown that FIRB clearly stepped outside its operational charter. No-one knows to what extent it was inappropriate or inept because its officers refused to answer straightforward questions. However, it is clear from the public evidence before the Senate committee that the operations of FIRB have not been subject to an internal review by officers of the Treasury for many years, nor have they been subject to a review by the Auditor-General. This is entirely unsatisfactory when government policy clearly states and requires a regular review of major programs such as FIRB at least every three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest aspect that has enmeshed FIRB having regard to the current Senate inquiry is the Senate's power to be given evidence that it requires. This is bound up with the government's claim in FIRB's defence of public interest privilege, which is clearly preventing FIRB's and the government's accountability in this very important area and case. There will be another exciting instalment of this matter, I can assure the Senate, because legal advice presently being sought and obtained by the committee may change forever the lack of transparency and public accountability of FIRB's performance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report tells us exactly the same as all the other reports have told us in recent years: very, very little about the real processes of FIRB. I think this report highlights the shambles that is the government's foreign investment policy. In 1992-93, FIRB considered 3,825 proposals and approved 98.4 per cent of them. The largest single category of proposals was again in real estate, which represented one-quarter of the $24 billion of total approved projects. Major increases in investment and mining helped to push the total investment close to the peak achieved back in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a cost to foreign investment in this country and it is one that this government continues to overlook. It was highlighted in the FitzGerald savings report. The savings report warned that dividends paid to foreign investors cost more than the cost of the equivalent foreign debt in the long term. This situation is made worse by current policy which has allowed 63 per cent of foreign investment to flow into the finance, property and business services. I believe these produce little or no foreign revenue capable of helping to service foreign debt. This proportion has almost doubled in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us back to FIRB. Not only is it forced to implement a fundamentally flawed foreign investment policy, in my view, but it does so in a fundamentally flawed way. Superficiality and secrecy shroud its every movement. The number of proposals considered by each of the 18 FIRB employees in 1992-93 was 192, which was up from the 160 in the year before, which was up considerably from the 35 that the officers had to look into in the mid-1980s. Most approvals were granted with conditions. These were not followed up. There is no mention in this annual report of the follow-up of the 1,933 conditional approvals left over from 1991 to 1992.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the aspect of secrecy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board seeks to ensure that proposals are dealt with quickly and efficiently and every effort is made to avoid unnecessary interference in normal commercial practice.</PARA>
<PARA>What does `unnecessary interference' mean? Does it mean minor, irritating things like the national interest, like whether the proposal will add to Australia's economic well-being? How do the people who work in FIRB make these important decisions? We are not exactly sure. We have asked; the Senate select committee has asked; and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will not allow his employees to tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has not been the only body having trouble getting material out of the secretive FIRB and Treasury. The Auditor-General was forced last year to resort to taking precept action against Treasury to obtain information for a performance audit. It was the first time in 70 years that a Public Service department refused information to the Auditor-General on expenditure&mdash;although, I suppose, if its performance is similar to the rest of Treasury, particularly the Foreign Investment Review Board, we can understand their reticence to be exposed. It is still totally unjustifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to continue to push to ensure that Australia develops a proper foreign investment policy that protects our national interest; that protects our economic sovereignty; that is long term, not short term; and that such a policy is defended and enforced by an independent, open, rigorous statutory body.

The policy in relation to foreign ownership in the media is a complete and utter incoherent mess. The annual report we are considering states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All proposals to invest in the media sector are subject to prior approval under the Government's foreign investment policy.</PARA>
<PARA>It then lists that policy in various areas. In broadcasting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign interests in commercial television broadcasting services continue to be limited to a 15 per cent company interest for individuals and a 20 per cent company interest in aggregate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is TV. But then we find:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign ownership and control limits have been removed for commercial radio.</PARA>
<PARA>So suddenly with radio we have no controls at all. When we get to subscription television broadcasting service licences, which Senator Collins knows about, we see:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . foreign interests are limited to a 20 per cent company interest for an individual and a 35 per cent company interest in aggregate.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we find the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no other foreign ownership and control restrictions on other broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA>Turning to newspapers, we find:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign investment in mass circulation newspapers is restricted. . . . The maximum permitted foreign interest involvement in mass circulation newspapers by a single shareholder is 25 per cent and unrelated foreign interests are allowed to have . . . shareholdings of up to 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Completely different limits are set for all the different media. There is no logic whatsoever to it. There is no description as to why one particular area of the media should have one level or another area of the media have none, different, higher or lower levels of foreign ownership allowed. It is utterly incoherent and without any logic whatsoever. As this report sets out, it is a major flaw in the government's policy on foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the second issue that concerns me greatly about FIRB, that is, the secrecy with which it operates. I can put it no better than the Communications Law Centre did in its submission to us:FIRB gives no notification of its activities, nor seeks submissions, nor explains its criteria and methods. Its recommendations to the Treasurer are not disclosed. Requests for details of FIRB recommendations, criteria and reasoning have been consistently rejected under the Freedom of Information Act. . . . Once decisions are taken, they are invariably announced in brief formal statements without the giving of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an unbelievable and intolerable way for FIRB to operate. We even had FIRB officers telling us, for example, that they never reply to correspondence from tenderers or bidders. The way in which the AIN consortium was dealt with by FIRB was quite unacceptable for a government agency. I share Senator Kernot's considerable concern about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, as I mentioned, Australia needs an independent regulatory body. It is quite clear to me that FIRB as an advisory body is nothing more than a couple of people paid a retainer to appear as though they sit on a board. All the action goes on in the Treasury; FIRB is really under the Treasury's thumb. The extent to which there is any independence is utterly illusory. Far too much discretion is given to the Treasurer of the day which, particularly in the media area, creates considerable problems with the suggestion of political influence. It is about time that we had a system that operated on the basis of clear rules set down by the parliament and policed by an independent regulatory body. I certainly share with the Democrats the view that we must move to that position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on many of the issues that I am concerned about in this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Investment Review Board Annual Report 1992-93</EMPHASIS> that have been mentioned, and there are some points I would like to add. I am interested in the comment made by the opposition about the fact that FIRB is under-resourced. I wonder whether that means the opposition would be in favour of extra government revenue. Normally it is in favour of cutting government revenue, so perhaps this is one area where it would be in favour of additional government revenue, provided that the board improved its practices. I guess that answering correspondence is very difficult for the board if it has not the people to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of applications that were being dealt with and the consequent number of acceptances mean that nearly everybody gets a guernsey in some way or another in terms of investment acceptance. It greatly concerns me that it is almost impossible to follow up whether conditions are satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the fact that on page v it is mentioned that there were 3,825 proposals for investment in Australia of which 3,602 were approved. However, turning to page 14 under `Urban real estate', we find that 3,236 of those proposals by foreign investors were to acquire urban real estate in Australia. That figure is increasing by 27 per cent. I am not surprised that in recent times the government has been saying that there is a buoyant market in real estate and that this is good for the economy when these figures come from this particular area. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be increasing investor interest in the acquisition of residential real estate for development, particularly the acquisition of real estate `off the plan'.</PARA>
<PARA>This means that these are the applications that have gone through to the Foreign Investment Review Board. Many applications slip the cordon altogether and, as we know, there is no means of following up. There is an increasing amount of speculative investment, not just in real estate but in almost every other sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the figures. As to minerals investment, 0.98 per cent was expected, but $4.13 billion was acquisitions and $1.12 billion new business. That means that taking over companies accounted for much greater investment than speculative investment in companies that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With manufacturing, we find $4.38 billion compared to $0.34 billion of new business. With services we find it is $2.52 billion compared with $1.20 billion of new business. This gives an indication that our pattern of investment consists largely of takeovers and speculation, and perhaps involves a fair degree of asset stripping. It has already been mentioned that a large loss of foreign exchange goes through profit repatriation and other means. This is something we need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether there is a firm policy on national interest, and whether the Foreign Investment Review Board has the least ability at this stage to look after our national interest. One can only wonder whether the desire to get runs on the board in terms of investment figures sometimes pushes government policy makers and the Treasury to require organisations such as the Foreign Investment Review Board to be more generous than they might otherwise be. Not providing the resources for more careful scrutiny of public interest from the Foreign Investment Review Board is one way of making sure that the runs get on the board; that is, nearly every post is a winner. It is a very short-sighted approach. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People find it difficult to own their own house when a great deal of speculative trade in real estate in Australia, whether domestic or otherwise, is going unnoticed or passing with a nod and a wink through the system. It will affect welfare, rent, mortgages and acquisitions, and will encourage asset stripping of other resources in Australia. This is something that we have never quite come to grips with, and not many people know what the situation is&mdash;neither does the government perhaps in real terms. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In the document produced by the Australian Taxation Office entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation statistics 1991-92</EMPHASIS>, I was interested to read the figures for sales tax in the latest returns. When I got a copy of the document earlier today, I set out to compare the statistics contained in it with those for the last three or four years. One of the most important contributions I can make here today is to say that one of the problems with the statistics&mdash;I have only looked into the sales tax figures&mdash;is that we cannot compare the sales tax statistics in this year's report with the statistics from last year, the year before or the year before that. If we were to try to make a comparison between the Commonwealth's revenue from, for example, sales tax on items such as household appliances, household hardware or any other business category, it is impossible to do so because the method for gathering such statistics changed this year. This year's method is different from that used for the last two years. The method for gathering statistics in 1989-90 was different again. It is therefore impossible to make a comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will ask the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cook, to provide to the Senate a version of the statistics for sales tax for the financial year to 30 June 1992 which is comparable with the last two or three years. We will then be able to see what has happened to sales tax revenue as a result of the recession and as a result of the upturn in the economy in the past few months. One of the downfalls of the Australian sales tax system with its many different rates is the fact that it puts on low and middle income earners a far greater burden than a progressive tax system would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we go through the figures for sales tax for various items, we note that low and middle income families are required to pay an enormous amount of tax on everyday items that they do not even know about. From the debates during the last election campaign and debates in this place over a number of years while we were discussing tax reform&mdash;it has gone off the agenda somewhat since&mdash;we know that Australia does have a number of different sales tax rates: 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 0 per cent and other rates applicable as exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I picked a basket of goods for the current year from table 6.3. It showed that some of the absolute necessities of life&mdash;some of the things that every family would buy at some time during the year, if not every week&mdash;would add up to something like $2.7 billion. That is a tax on families that applies whether somebody is a multimillionaire or living in the back blocks of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those items alone, if we divide the amount spent on them by the number of households in Australia, we find that every household in Australia would pay $500.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the report relating to the implementation of the Commonwealth government's responses to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It is an important document and a number of facts should be brought home to people when they consider Aboriginal deaths in custody. The report states that, in the last year to June 1993, 72 people died in custody. Of them, six were Aboriginal and 66 were non-Aboriginal. In fact, the rate of non-Aboriginal deaths in custody is increasing. The significant thing that I wish to refer to is the inequality that has occurred over the years in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enormous amount of money was spent on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I refer particularly to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> dated 1 November 1993. The article was written by Neil J. Thompson, former Head of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and David McDonald, Deputy Head of Research from the Criminology Research Unit of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. They set out to assess the risks of death in police or prison custody in Australia for Aborigines and non-Aborigines. The important and interesting thing that came out of that assessment was their conclusion, and I quote:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduction of the excess of Aboriginal over non-Aboriginal deaths in police and prison custody relative to general population figures requires action to reduce the over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody and to improve the general well-being and health status of Aboriginal people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to this document today because I have already spoken on the National Health and Medical Research Council report, in which it was interesting to note that $398,000 is being devoted for research funding. Almost a similar amount was spent last year in the alcohol and other substance abuse prevention program under the implementation of the same Commonwealth government response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. All of us know that something must be done about the problems that beset the Aboriginals because the combination of a 40 to 50 per cent Aboriginal adult unemployment rate with alcohol consumption in a community that has 10 times the Australian average of diabetes is a lethal one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witch hunt that occurred in relation to prison officers and police officers in this community was really not warranted. Although there are problems in relation to the custodial measures that ensued in this community&mdash;as Senator Collins pointed out three years ago&mdash;there seems to be a perception that the police were killing Aboriginals in custody. The police officers I know felt that they had to share this burden&mdash;a burden which did not exist in fact&mdash;with others throughout Australia. This lethal combination of the factors I have mentioned will not improve until those factors have been overcome in the Aboriginal community. If anybody wishes to read about this issue in more</PARA>
