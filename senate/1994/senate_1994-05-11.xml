<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill makes a number of "technical" amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act. Broadly, these amendments will allow better management, focus, and control in relation to approved joint venture and consortium, and approved trading houses; give greater promotional focus to certain expenditure; and provide Austrade with the power to introduce and administer a system of accreditation for export grants consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included under the scheme since 1990/91, as single entity claimants, have been groupings of exporters known as approved joint venture and approved consortium. This facility, which is designed to assist small exporters, allows exporters to present a group approach to markets where their aggregation of effort can demonstrate advantages over promotion being conducted by an individual. The advantage for exporters is that they remain as individuals for all other purposes under the EMDG scheme, including the ability to receive grants in their own right for their other export promotional endeavours. The facility is project based, and is at the discretion of Austrade within the confines of the Act, and ministerially approved guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approved trading houses are individual entities, which, by virtue of their international network and trading expertise, are able to assist the promotion of the product of exporters who lack the funds and ability to undertake EMDG eligible promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently Austrade has only 30 days in which to make all of the enquiries necessary to make a decision whether or not to grant approved joint venture/consortium status, or approved trading house status. This period, in many instances, has proved too short to allow for consideration of all of the facts. A period of 60 days should overcome this barrier to good decision making, whilst at the same time, not unduly delaying the processing of applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given approved status, it is important that the joint venture or consortium, or the trading house, is monitored for adherence to the conditions of approval. The act is deficient in regard to providing Austrade with the power to reconsider approved status in the light of subsequent unsatisfactory performance, or where guidelines have been amended to reflect changed government attitude. This bill rectifies the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general limit to the number of EMD grants receivable by claimants is eight. With the focus of approval for joint venture/consortium being project specific, rather than the broad scope of activity afforded to other categories of claimant, and in the light of experience, the control provided by this bill in limiting approved joint venture/consortium to a maximum of five grants is seen as an appropriate life span for joint ventures and is consistent with the original intention of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In lieu of non claimable accommodation, entertainment and sustenance expenses, the scheme provides an eligible expenditure allowance of $200 per day&mdash;maximum of 21 days per overseas trip. Currently, this allowance is assessed on the basis of the prime and principal purpose of the totality of trip, rather than focusing on the actual time devoted to eligible promotional activity. This bill, on the one hand, eliminates the possibility of the scheme supporting recreational time spent on overseas trips, and on the other hand, does not eliminate from grants consideration, those exporters who may wish to undertake limited promotional activity whilst overseas primarily for other reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, there are a number of consultants who provide a service to EMDG claimants with respect to the preparation and lodgement of claims. In 1992/93, approximately 50 per cent of claims were lodged through, or with the assistance of, consultants. As part of Austrade's enhancement of EMDG risk management, accreditation will provide a mechanism for improving the accuracy of lodged claims, thereby freeing some investigatory resources for use elsewhere within the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXCISE TARIFF LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill incorporates Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1993 into the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1994 into the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1993 proposed to remove an anomaly that exists in the treatment of crude oil production for crude oil excise purposes under the Excise Tariff Act 1921.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Duties of excise are payable under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 on crude petroleum oil produced in Australia. As a result of the operation of other Commonwealth legislation, such as the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987, excise is in effect only payable on crude petroleum oil produced from the North West Shelf project area and in most onshore production areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1987, the Government introduced changes to the petroleum taxation arrangements to encourage petroleum exploration and development in Australia. A key factor in these changes was the exemption of the first 4767.3 megalitres of crude petroleum oil produced from onshore fields and offshore projects from the payment of excise. This exempt crude oil is defined as "exempt onshore oil" and "exempt offshore oil". The granting of the exemption in respect of exempt offshore oil is dependent upon whether the oil is produced from a "project". As the term project is not defined and there is no other relevant statutory or industry definition, uncertainty exists as to the scope of the exemption from the payment of excise on crude oil produced from offshore projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To eliminate this uncertainty and to provide for the consistent treatment of exempt offshore oil and exempt onshore oil, it is proposed to change the basis for the granting of the exemption from the payment of excise on offshore oil while still fulfilling the intention of the original 1987 policy. The exemption is proposed to be granted in respect of crude oil produced from an offshore field, where field is a term that is readily understood in the petroleum industry. It is also proposed to insert provisions that will enable the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to make guidelines that are to be taken into account when prescribing a field for the purposes of granting this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments have the support of the North West Shelf Joint Venture participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No.1 of 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excise Tariff Proposal No.1 of 1994 proposes to correct cross references in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act (the CELA Act). A number of sections in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 referred to provisions in the CELA Act for their commencement. When the CELA Act was renumbered as a result of amendments by the Senate, the cross references in the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 were not altered to take account of these amendments. The proposed amendments correct this error.</PARA>

While the clauses now provide that people need not be consulted in every case before personal information about them is disclosed, they do say that they should be consulted if the person concerned is one who `might reasonably wish to contend that the record ought not to be disclosed'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Privacy Commission indicates&mdash;and this is certainly my concern&mdash;that it is not clear how such a discretion should be applied. I believe that this legislation should contain guidelines on how this view is to be formed as to whether this person might reasonably object to having the details disclosed. There should be differential treatment for ordinary clients of the Department of Social Security, for taxpayers, for grant applicants, for police witnesses and for subjects of criminal records. I would imagine that all of those people&mdash;and possibly there are many other categories&mdash;would strenuously object to having their personal details divulged. On the other hand, there would be classes of people&mdash;public servants possibly, ministers, politicians and others&mdash;who might not fall into that category. The problem is that these sections do not provide these guidelines. There are no criteria on the basis of which the public servant can make that decision as to whether the information should be disclosed and whether a person would fall into that category and, therefore, needs to be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other general area to be critical of in these clauses is that the criteria put forward focus entirely on reasons for not giving notice and may indeed be difficult to apply in practice. For example, how does a middle level agency officer processing an FOI request inform himself or herself as to whether the personal information sought is `well known', whether the person is known to be associated with this particular matter or whether the personal information is indeed publicly available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns expressed by the Privacy Commissioner is that, according to the Attorney-General's Department, the Privacy Act ought not to be applied to material and departmental records that happen to be publicly available in another place. However, it seems to me that those items of information which are contained, for example, in a Social Security departmental record and which are also publicly available ought not to be disclosed simply on the grounds that they are also publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his reply to the Privacy Commissioner on these points, stated, first of all, that the Attorney-General's Department's practice had changed. That is good news, but I would feel a lot safer if these provisions were in the legislation. The minister also says that the concerns raised about private information also being available in the public context would give rise to the officer certainly approaching the person and asking for that person's advice or protest to be made before that information is disclosed. But at this stage all we have is the minister's suggestion that this would actually happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also says that that will be formalised by a memorandum on freedom of information practices which will be issued once this bill is passed. That is putting the cart before the horse. On behalf of the people who have elected me to the Senate, I am not happy to sit here and say, `It is not satisfactory as it stands but there will be a memorandum in due course which will give guidelines to the officers concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have at the moment is an indication that this will happen. I believe it is the responsibility of this chamber to ensure that the legislation we pass contains proper safeguards in a form which we can judge is acceptable to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a suggestion in the minister's letter in reply to the Privacy Commissioner that, if it is found in practice that further guidelines are necessary, such further guidelines will be issued. How sloppy can it get! These few comments indicate why I am suggesting that this whole section should be withdrawn by the government. It should be redrafted and brought back before the chamber in a reasonable shape. At the moment it is a ramshackle provision that does not provide any safeguards; does not provide a clear guide to what the government intends to do; and does not commit the minister or his department to a particular course of action. It is all up in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is simply not satisfactory for the minister to say that these things will be dealt with one way or another. I believe that I have demonstrated very clearly why these particular provisions should not be passed in the form in which they are before this chamber. I commend the amendment to remove that section, and I call on the minister to agree to that course of action. I call on him to bring those clauses back to the Senate when the wording has been properly amended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take some time to go through this particular point, if for no other reason than to facilitate some discussions that Senator Vanstone might be involved in on other aspects of the bill. My advice is that section 27A of the Freedom of Information Act&mdash;the section which is the subject of this particular clause 53&mdash;was proposed only after a very long and serious consideration of the recommendations in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1987. It is a report of which I am well aware because I chaired that committee in that particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the government received the report I am sure that it gave long and serious consideration to our recommendations. The section was inserted in 1988 by the passage of the Privacy Act. An amendment was made in 1991 in conformity with the Privacy Act and it instituted the concept of personal information rather than `information relating to personal affairs' which had been used to that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment also enacted the Senate committee recommendation by removing the discretion that decision makers had of consulting a person, where another person had sought access to personal information about him or her, making such consultation mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposed amendments seek to reverse that latter amendment and reinstate the discretionary approach with some legislative criteria on matters to be considered in exercising that discretion. It might also help at this stage to explain the background to the series of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our 1987 report the Senate committee recommended that, in the case of business affairs documents, the qualification that consultation was required only when it appeared to the officer or minister dealing with the request that the third party might reasonably wish to contend that the document is an exempt document under section 43 be removed. That was in chapter 8, paragraph 16 of that report. The committee also recommended that the reverse FOI process for personal affairs documents be the same as for business affairs documents. That is in 8.83.2 and 8.86. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to the 1991 amendments to the FOI Act. The term `personal affairs' is replaced with the term `personal information', which, as I think Senator Spindler will understand, is defined in the FOI Act to cover a much wider range of information than that found to be included in the term `personal affairs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular it covers information about a person's work or official acts, and information about someone which is widely known or is in the public domain. That, I think, is going to the core of the particular issue that is before us this morning. On the other hand, `business affairs' had a much narrower application as it relates to anything that occupies a person or business for the purpose of profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the difficulty that has arisen in respect to section 27A is that, in removing the qualification of `reasonable contention', it has become mandatory to consult on every occasion that a document contains third party personal information, irrespective of the fact that that information might be well known or that there might be no reasonable grounds for thinking the disclosure of that information would be unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth going to some of these examples because they are real life cases where consultation has taken place. I raise them to indicate that the inflexibility in the section has led to some situations which could be called Monty Pythonesque in nature. I am told that consultation was required, for instance&mdash;much to the bemusement of those consulted&mdash;in cases where a copy of an entry from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's who</EMPHASIS> had appeared on file, or in cases where several newspaper articles and speeches made by members of parliament were included in files. To actually consult people about whether one can release under FOI a copy of a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's who</EMPHASIS> entry, of course, does have some farcical connotations. Further information which disclosed that a well-known person had carried out consultancy work for an agency and the fact that that person had discussed that in a published autobiography&mdash;and, I am sure, probably had promoted it a number of times in his life&mdash;also led to one of those farcical situations. That is the sort of problem that the amendments before us today are trying to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The qualification on the requirement to consult, which appears in proposed section 27(1)AA, should not be looked at in isolation from the rest of the section in the form in which it will be when it is amended. The following amendment to section 27A will still retain the requirement to consult where the person `might reasonably wish to contend' that the document contains personal information, the disclosure of which would `involve unreasonable disclosure of personal information'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a reasonable contention could be made, consultation is mandatory. The proposed subsection 27(1)A provides guidelines; these are the guidelines to which Senator Spindler referred. They are only guidelines and should not be seen to pre-empt the primary responsibility for proper decision making under section 27A. I have been informed that, as part of the normal practice, once the legislation is passed the Attorney-General's Department will issue an FOI memorandum setting out in greater detail the circumstances in which the primary responsibility would be discharged. The development of that memorandum could involve consulting with Senator Spindler to see what points he would like us to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only unintended consequence of the 1988 and 1991 amendments. One consequence that, I suppose, we should all be concerned about is that the inflexibility, I am informed, has led to an increase in costs to an FOI applicant arising from both unnecessary consultation about information and, of course, the provision of information which quite often can be on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I am told that, in the case of a departmental file cover which shows only the names of the 20 officers who handled the file over a period of many years, each and every one of those officers would have to be consulted to see whether they objected to such disclosure. Senator Spindler might say that this happens only in extreme cases, but it is amazing how often these sorts of cases do arise and it is amazing what sort of needless inconvenience they can cause. As I say, the current law would require each of those officers to be consulted to see whether they objected to disclosure. This consultation process could, I am informed further, conservatively add some $200 to $400 to the charges to be paid by an FOI applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is possible for an agency to claim that the consultation process in such a case would unreasonably divert agency resources. For instance, if 100 people made submissions to an inquiry and a list of them appeared as an appendix to the published report of that inquiry, when the list is found on an agency file it will attract under section 27A the requirement to consult all of those people. The time and expense of such consultations would be sufficient in respect of a smaller agency to amount to an unreasonable diversion of resources. The agency could therefore refuse the FOI request. Without this requirement, the FOI request of course could be quite easily managed by the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons the government is concerned to obtain some flexibility in the operation of the law in this area. We could consult with Senator Spindler on the development of those guidelines and maybe in doing so overcome some of the problems he might have.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment has some history. The chamber will recall that I approached the Privacy Commissioner because I had some concerns about the amendments which I sought to delete just a few minutes ago. I received a response from the Privacy Commissioner saying that he had provided comments on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). He said further that it was not his practice to canvass with non-government members concerns or otherwise about bills, but indicated that non-government members should make requests to the relevant minister for access to the Privacy Commissioner's comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said that the Privacy Commissioner was simply implementing the rules which govern his conduct. The provisions in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, I believe, are similar to those governing specifically the commissioner's conduct in the privacy legislation. Subsection 11(1)(e) of the act says that, amongst the functions the Human Rights Commissioner has to fulfil, the following is included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To examine enactments, and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the telling phrase&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(when requested to do so by the Minister) proposed enactments, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the enactments or proposed enactments, as the case may be, are, or would be, inconsistent with or contrary to any human right, and to report to the Minister the results of any such examination.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no provision in the relevant two pieces of legislation to enable either the Human Rights Commissioner or the Privacy Commissioner, who are both statutory officers, to provide their advice to this parliament or to members of this parliament, be they senators or members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then wrote to the minister requesting that the advice he had received from the Privacy Commissioner should also be provided to me. The minister&mdash;and I am grateful for his action&mdash;did so. He provided me with a copy of the letter he received from the Privacy Commissioner and also a copy of the letter he wrote in reply to the concerns the Privacy Commissioner expressed. The Minister for Justice in his cover letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have consulted the Privacy Commissioner about the release to you of this correspondence. The Commissioner has agreed to its release and I enclose a copy of the letter I received from the Commissioner together with a copy of my reply to the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. The Privacy Commissioner has agreed to it. But the point is that, whether the Privacy Commissioner had agreed or had not agreed, the decision rested with the minister. So to that extent the minister's cover letter, courteous though it is, is misleading. It ignores the fact that it was not the Privacy Commissioner who made the decision to disclose his advice to me as a senator of this parliament, it was the minister who decided that he would provide that advice to me. The minister would have been within his legal rights to say, `No, go jump in the lake. I will not let you have the advice I have received from the statutory officer, from the Privacy Commissioner.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in the last half hour, during the debate on the contents of those provisions, that the legislation is flawed, that the advice from the statutory officer helped to draw attention to that and helped to point the direction the amendments should take. It is very clear indeed, if one needed any detail to support the obvious principle, that members of this parliament should have access to advice from statutory officers, such as the Human Rights Commissioner or the Privacy Commissioner, on legislation before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very clearly, we are charged with a duty to assess government legislation. We are charged with a duty either to amend, reject or pass it. Surely we must be able to do that on the basis of the best advice available and not have a political consideration interfering with that to enable the minister to say, `The advice you might get from the Human Rights Commissioner, the advice I have received, may contain some political embarrassment. I'd rather not let you have it.' Under the present state of the legislation, that is the end of the matter. A member of parliament would not be able to obtain that advice from a statutory officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that basis that I am moving my amendment. The objective of the amendment is, as stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) to enable Parliamentarians to request the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to report on proposed Commonwealth, State and Territory enactments; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) to provide that reports to the Minister or a Parliamentarian by the Commission be laid before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I have already pointed to the section which currently prevents that from happening. Further in my amendment, clause 11A(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Parliamentarian may request the Commission to report to the Parliamentarian on any proposed enactment of the Commonwealth, a State, or a Territory for the purpose of ascertaining whether the proposed enactment would be inconsistent with or contrary to any human right.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that this is the section of the amendment which deals with the Human Rights Commission. It also includes a definition of `proposed enactment'. It defines it as legislation introduced into the parliament, or a proposed law prepared on behalf of the government of the Commonwealth, a State or the administration of a Territory, and it includes an instrument proposed to be made under the law. In other words, it includes regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision for the advice provided to the minister or a parliamentarian to be tabled within five sitting days. Similar provisions in the amendment apply to the Privacy Act 1988. The amendment seeks to deal with both the Human Rights Commission and the Privacy Commission. I will not go through these amendments. They are similar in intent and largely in detail to the ones that I have outlined to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge my appreciation of the speedy drafting that was provided on this occasion by the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk Assistant (Procedure). I am not putting that on record to suggest that their service at other times throughout the year is anything but 105 per cent, but I am conscious that on this occasion, because of the way in which the matter arose, I had to have this drafting done in double quick time. I am very grateful for the excellent drafting and the speed with which the material was provided. It might have been a little too fast&mdash;not for the clerks, but for the opposition and, apparently, the government&mdash;because it seems that I am not going to get support for this amendment from either the government or the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle is acknowledged, I understand, that parliamentarians should have access to the best possible advice that is available when they consider legislation before parliament. But all sorts of difficulties are discovered in the proposition that I am putting in this amendment. I understand that there are some concerns on the opposition side about including state legislation. We do have on record legislation passed. We have, for instance, the juvenile justice legislation in Western Australia; the Crimes Act amendments on police powers to demand names and addresses, obtain forensic samples and undertake fingerprinting in Victoria; and the indeterminate sentencing legislation in Victoria. These are all pieces of legislation which are in breach of Australia's obligations under international conventions which we have signed and ratified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be ludicrous to say that we should not be able to obtain advice from the Human Rights Commission or the Privacy Commissioner on state legislation which should properly be overridden by legislation in this Commonwealth parliament. But that seems to be a difficulty. Indeed, one has noticed a distinct reluctance by the Commonwealth government to take action to override state legislation that is not in keeping with our obligations as a Commonwealth and as the Australian nation. The real test will come on whether this government has the courage to do something about the Tasmanian laws making homosexual behaviour a criminal offence following a view expressed by the United Nations human rights committee that that legislation is indeed contrary to our obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of almost fraudulent argument has been in the newspapers recently about that, notably by Senator Kemp, suggesting that this is an infringement of our sovereignty. Unfortunately, in making that claim, Senator Kemp omitted to mention that the United Nations human rights committee did not make a ruling that is legally binding on Australia. All it did was to provide a view&mdash;that is the word used. Whether the Commonwealth government and this parliament decide to do something about the obnoxious legislation in Tasmania is, and remains, a decision of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to the day when this legislation is before us so that we can determine whether we wish to accept the advice of the United Nations human rights committee. To present that as an infringement of our sovereignty is little more than fraudulent. In my discussions with the government other reasons were given as to why this amendment should not proceed, such as the workload of the officers concerned&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that the government gave for opposing my amendment is that it might result in undue workload for the commissioners concerned. But the fact that should be obvious to anyone is that, if an agency or commissioner arrives at a conclusion on legislation before the House and puts that conclusion in writing, to provide that to another inquirer is no more in these days of advanced technology than running off yet another letter, another copy of a statement. Since it is already one of the functions of the commissioners to examine such legislation when requested by the minister, surely it is not too much to ask that non-government members should have the same access. As I said, once an opinion has been arrived at, surely it is just running off a copy. It is a furphy to say otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the other point is a little closer to the bone. It was indicated that the position of the commissioner as an adviser to government involved in the early preparation and drafting of legislation might be compromised if these officers then are asked to provide advice or information to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would, of course, accept that any dealings between these officers and the government during the initial stages of preparing and drafting legislation should remain confidential. They should not be asked to divulge what they said to the government, what the government answered and how, in turn, they dealt with it. I think that is accepted. But surely, once the legislation is drafted, once it is before this chamber, the position changes. These officers, the human rights commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner and possibly others, have a statutory duty to assess the consequences of that legislation. The fact that at an earlier stage they assisted the government with advice on framing the legislation should not be a matter that the government should shy away from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the political fear and trepidation and the desire to keep quiet any information or advice that has been provided by these officers. But here we have a real conflict between an executive government that wants to ram through legislation that it wants on the statute books and the duty of this parliament, firstly, to examine that legislation and judge whether that legislation is technically correct, whether it achieves the government's claimed purpose and, secondly, whether it is right in substance&mdash;whether its purpose is correct. That is something that this chamber is charged with doing, and it should be allowed to do it. It is little short of interfering with the work of this chamber for the government to say we cannot have the best advice in this country that is available on that legislation before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told that, now that this issue has been raised, the government is prepared to have a close look at the implications of the matter I have raised. While the clerks were able to deal with the time scale of bringing on this particular amendment, the government obviously could not. On this one, I would be happy to continue consultation with the government to arrive at an acceptable formula. But I would appreciate an acknowledgment from the minister, which I have received informally in a sense, that the government accepts the principle that I am putting forward in this amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whoever was doing it and whoever was giving it, they were doing it in a fast and loose way. It was fast and loose from Senator Spindler and it might have been a bit fast and loose from those who drafted this legislation. The government has concerns not just with the detail but with the policy and commitment that has been made with respect to the policy. We find it interesting, and there may be capacity for it to be pursued further, or possibly discussed in the current House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which has been examining some privacy issues. It could look at this particular aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that the advice is fast and loose because it is, and someone is trying to get his snout into the constitutional trough. I do not know whether it is Senator Spindler or whether it is the way the advice has come out through the clerk's office. With my suspicious mind, I presume guilt in this case until someone proves himself innocent. What we have here may be good intentions on Senator Spindler's part but, when one looks at the proposal that has been drafted, there could be no greater grab for intervention, not just across the federal government but across every tier of government in this country&mdash;every bureaucracy, every aspect of it&mdash;than the words that are before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler might want a role for the Privacy Commissioner. We in government think there always has to be a balance, and I will get to that balance later. But Senator Spindler's proposal is a bit over the top. It allows for a member of parliament to seek advice from the Privacy Commissioner direct. It would probably be good for Senator Harradine to listen to this because I know he has an interest in these sorts of issues. Under Senator Spindler's definition in clause 84C, a member of parliament can seek advice from the Privacy Commissioner with respect to a proposed law prepared on behalf of the government of the Commonwealth or of a state or the administration of a territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler is saying that, in relation to an initial draft on anything by any government across the spectrum&mdash;state, territory or whatever&mdash;without looking at this issue any further, as Senator Vanstone rightly says, a member of parliament can snap off a letter to the Privacy Commissioner, with disregard for any constitutional balances in place, and ask for that advice to be made public. Senator Spindler is also proposing that this cover a proposed law prepared on behalf of a minister of state of the Commonwealth or a minister of a state government or a Territory administration. The old driftnet is broadened. If that is not sufficient, it also covers any proposed law prepared on behalf of `a body established by law that has the function of recommending proposed laws of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory'. If we have not got everyone by then, it also covers an instrument proposed to be made under a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Spindler is basically saying is that, without due consideration in this place, someone has drafted at his request a law that will allow the Privacy Commissioner, at the snap of a letter, a request or a fax, to investigate not just a law before a parliament but the idea of legislation that might be developed in a particular forum. I think that shows that someone has been playing fast and loose with this proposal. Someone wants to get his snout in the constitutional trough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Vanstone is right when she says that, because Senator Spindler has come up with one idea, it does not mean that that is the only idea in the ballpark. What I have just shown is that Senator Spindler's idea has a few problems. Let us acknowledge this as being one idea. Despite the intention and desire on the part of some of us on this side of parliament to take over the states&mdash;that is something we have been accused of having secret aspirations for for a long time&mdash;what Senator Spindler is doing here is putting up something that, I must say, is a little half-baked and really needs to be thought through in terms of its implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say on this side of the parliament that this legislation is an inappropriate way for such a major policy change to be addressed, particularly when we view that policy change in the way I have just described. We also say that this sort of proposal would have massive resource implications for HREOC and the Privacy Commissioner. It is not very hard to contemplate those resource implications when any reasonable reading of Senator Spindler's proposal would show that it would include any proposal for law reform from any ministerial council, any body such as the Law Reform Commission, the Family Law Council and the Administrative Review Council, any advisory committee I might have working for me on immigration, and any advisory committee that might be set up under a law of the Commonwealth&mdash;and everything is set up under a law of the Commonwealth; we cannot appropriate funds without that. So it has huge resource implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that we try to strike a balance. I can go into that, but I do not know that I need to. What I have done so far has shown that the proposal that has been put has got problems.

My advice is that, in the normal administration of a government department or a GBE, we have actually placed obligations on them to comply with the Privacy Act and with the relevant legislation. Those departments and GBEs have an obligation to do so. In carrying out that obligation, they are encouraged to work through the Attorney-General's Department to get advice from the Privacy Commissioner as to how they meet, or do not meet, their obligations under such legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see a bit of a distinction between the latter and the former; that is to say, advice given by HREOC or by the Privacy Commissioner to GBEs or government departments in respect of what they are required to do under the relevant legislation, and advice to the government in the preparation of legislation. As to the former, is there anything that would prevent the parliament and parliamentarians from seeking and, in fact, receiving copies of that advice which, of course, affects the operations of the government department or the GBE in matters of principle?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I detect a degree of sympathy around the chamber&mdash;certainly I am sympathetic&mdash;to the thrust of the Senator Spindler's proposal that members of parliament should be able to obtain from the Privacy Commissioner and from HREOC advice in considering legislation placed before this parliament. There was one example only the other day when the Senate had before it health insurance legislation. We were then dealing with powers of investigation&mdash;a function that was being transferred from the AFP to the Health Insurance Commission. Those of us who were present at the time will be aware that on that occasion we were concerned about what the Privacy Commissioner was saying. The government would not tell us what the Privacy Commissioner was saying about that particular legislation. We knew the Privacy Commissioner was a bit concerned about the aspects of maintaining the integrity of patients' records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been useful for honourable senators in that debate to have been provided with the response that the Privacy Commissioner gave to the government on that piece of legislation. I think that is perfectly reasonable. We could not get it on that occasion. We had an assurance eventually by the government that the Privacy Commissioner was satisfied. I believe we also had an indication from the Privacy Commissioner to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point made by Senator Spindler is a good one. I take the point that the minister has made.

I am using the terms quite definitely; it is a matter of principle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I was alluding to earlier was that a balance is struck in the legislation between the concept of ministerial responsibility and the concept of the Privacy Commissioner having the capacity to make an impact on public debate. The government's position thus far has been that under the legislation the Privacy Commissioner should report to parliament through the responsible minister. That is in the legislation and that reflects the Westminster system of ministerial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine asked what happens in the preparation of legislation. Government departments have a capacity to get advice through the Attorney-General's Department. That is the formal channel that is recommended and encouraged to be used&mdash;and is the formal channel that will continue to be encouraged to be used. The role of Attorney-General is pivotal in terms of the provision of that advice in terms of the bureaucracy and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing the Privacy Act and the legislation governing the Privacy Commissioner's powers, the parliament took into account the fact that on some occasions it would be in the public interest to release advice on legislation. Under section 31 of the Privacy Act the Commissioner is able to make an initial report to the minister concerning a proposed enactment. That is there already. He also has the capacity to make a second report where it is in the public interest to do so. In essence, there is the capacity for the Privacy Commissioner to make an assessment as to whether it is in the public interest to provide information publicly to a member of parliament or to a broader constituency. That legislative regime ensures that the ministerial responsibility channel is the pivotal part of it. What Senator Spindler is proposing would detract from that structure in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason it is felt that mechanism is important is that it will ensure the Privacy Commissioner has an ongoing role in the cabinet deliberative processes. If we were to do things as broadly as Senator Spindler suggests, I think there would be a conflict of interest. The Privacy Commissioner would be responsible openly to whoever wants to write to him or her and, at the same time, would have a role in the cabinet deliberative process. The structure is set up to reflect the important role the Privacy Commissioner plays in the deliberative process. At the end of the day, if he or she is not happy, the commissioner has the capacity to issue a second report, if it is in the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also capacity in the Privacy Act for a mechanism for the reports of the Privacy Commissioner to be tabled in parliament to enable members to have the benefit of the commissioner's views. There is the capacity for public awareness of the Privacy Commissioner's views, and at the same time there is a consideration in the legislation that the confidential and deliberative role in the cabinet process that the Privacy Commissioner plays needs to be protected. I hope that answers Senator Spindler's question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which affect assistance arrangements for students throughout Australia. The opposition has given careful consideration to these two bills. Essentially, the bills are bringing disciplines, especially disciplines on recipients of Austudy, to the administration to ensure that what is intended as the benefit is more precisely what happens, that disciplines are tightened to ensure that there are no overpayments and that, where there are overpayments, they are reasonably repaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties broadly support the bills that are before us, but one matter which I will refer to towards the end of my speech will lead to my moving at the committee stage amendments that affect the assets test for health cardholders, which a year ago was clearly announced to be a benefit that the government was extending to, and would be of special benefit to, those suffering in the rural crisis in Australia. The government eventually reneged on that&mdash;and did it in a most deplorable way&mdash;and we will hold the government to its original announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the main body of these two bills. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill provides for the first time a legislative basis for existing programs that we have been used to discussing for many years now&mdash;that is, the assistance for isolated children, and the other program, Abstudy. It is good to see that there is a legislative basis for these two programs. It is the case that the Liberal and National parties have long called for assistance for isolated children both in the original calling for a program for these families and the needs of their student sons and daughters, and then calling periodically for setting the pace with regard to increasing those benefits and making sure that they continue to meet the needs of isolated families. The Labor government has periodically agreed with our urgings, but has apparently been reluctant to concede the justice in the arguments put by the Liberal and National parties that affect isolated children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abstudy is a program that has bipartisan support and has been seen from both sides of parliament as an important instrument to help Aboriginal Australians gain tertiary qualifications&mdash;indeed, even secondary qualifications&mdash;that will assist them to have the same opportunities and outcomes as other Australians. Abstudy is broadly parallel with Austudy. With regard to both of these programs, we welcome this new provision of a legislative basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill extends the debt management regime to several programs, including Aboriginal programs, and extends the time for notifying changes of circumstances from seven to 14 days. It also decriminalises failure to do so and introduces a weekly charge for non-notification. These are disciplines which are already in place for Austudy, by and large, and will be consistent with Austudy arrangements as a result of this bill. The opposition does not object to these new disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill adjusts thresholds for the repayment of the financial supplement. The Senate will recall that a supplementary scheme to Austudy was introduced following the Chapman report and students are allowed to opt for a loan up to twice the amount that would have been available to them by grant. But it becomes a loan and, therefore, there is a judgment to be made by students as to whether an Austudy supplement by way of loan is of more advantage to them in their studies than a lower amount that would be entirely by grant. The thresholds for repaying the loans and for HECS liabilities have been different until now and this bill brings the thresholds into alignment. We also note that there are provisions to index the dependent spouse allowance. We regard these as reasonable measures and we support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have given notice to me in the last 24 hours that they will move amendments in the committee stage resisting bringing the thresholds into alignment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Senator Bell will explain them in due course and I will hear what he has to say with regard to those first nine amendments, but at this moment we are not convinced to support those measures. We are disposed, subject to hearing his speech, to accept the thresholds being aligned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 brings changes to three of the established acts that relate to students&mdash;the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Under these three acts there are benefits that are received by a number of students and there are repercussions in relation to recovery if there is overpayment to a student receiving Austudy that relate to reducing benefits. With regard to any moneys that are owed to the government or any due charges that have not been fully paid, this measure allows a deduction from the payment that would ordinarily be made under any of these three acts. This is really only honest bookkeeping. We in the Senate have a proper duty to all taxpayers, and it is a matter of reasonableness to see these provisions in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to a matter that the scrutiny of bills committee&mdash;a very important committee of this Senate&mdash;has brought to our attention. As we know, this committee looks at every piece of legislation before it is debated here. If there is a trespass upon the established principles of law or the unintended inclusion in a bill of a matter that is not necessary or ought not to be there, then the committee will report that fact to the Senate and put forward a remedy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee says, it is a very important committee. For years the reports from that committee have been unanimous. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, we give a great deal of credibility to the scrutiny of bills committee. In this case, that committee has reported real concern with regard to shifting the liability that falls upon students when there is overpayment from being a liability that arises from failure to notify to being what is called a strict liability. In most areas of law, strict liability falls upon a person who offends by a deliberate action that causes some cost for which there is need for redress or reimbursement. In this case, the bill is placing strict liability upon students receiving overpayment, but their offence may be only that they failed to notify on time, and the overpayment may be actually rather small. It can also be of a moderately high amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is concerned about this new and, to it, unwarranted placing of strict liability on such students. This change also effectively reverses the onus of proof in that students would have to prove their innocence, as it were, or prove why they should not attract a penalty. If the bill did not have these provisions, the onus of proof would fall upon the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has led to some circulated amendments, again from the Democrats, for which at the moment I am not indicating support but, rather, concern. I want to hear the argument by our colleague Senator Bell for the Democrats and, more particularly, I say to the minister and the advisers: I want to hear very carefully the government's response to the very legitimate concerns of the scrutiny of bills committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Democrats are moving the last five of their amendments, Nos 10 to 14, which relate to this matter. If they were to be adopted, large slabs of pages 16, 17 and part of 18 would be removed from the bill. Essentially, they affect the schedule, clauses 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the interjection of the minister. I ask that, in summing up, the minister respond very carefully to this matter. As I say, I have yet to be persuaded entirely that the right remedy is clearly to hand, but I will listen in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now refer to the particular amendment I will be moving in the committee stage. This arises from disgraceful action by the present Labor government. In the last budget the minister clearly announced that the Austudy benefits would be made available to students on the basis that there would be no assets test for any family that held a health care card. There was no ambiguity about it. And families, especially some who are struggling in the bush, hit by the rural crisis, took the consolation that their son or daughter could proceed to enrol in a university or other area of study on the basis of a clear government announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was this announced at the time of the budget, it was also in a press release last September by the Department of Employment, Education and Training; in the budget papers&mdash;there was no ambiguity in the estimates committees of the Senate; and it was in the Austudy brochure and the Austudy application form. All of this transpired in August, September, October and November last year. When the regulations for this matter were published in December, to have effect from 1 January and the whole of this calendar year, lo and behold, there was no provision in the regulations for this clear announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no press release. There was no statement by any minister of this government to say that a mistake had been made or that the decision had been reversed or anything else. The families, acting upon this information, found out only when they had made their application and were told, `Even though it is in the Austudy brochure, even though it is in the Austudy application form, even though it is in the DEET announcement of September, even though it is in the government's budget, it is not actually true. A misunderstanding has been perpetrated by a few officers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people were told individually about this without any announcement. This is just not good enough. In considering legislation the Senate is required to hold governments accountable for what they say to the Australian public. Governments cannot act in such a disgraceful way. It is estimated that there are perhaps 200 families who will be allowed Austudy if the announcement is upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives us a chance to add a request&mdash;and because this is an addition to the bill in the Senate and has financial implications it cannot be an amendment, it must be a request. After some discussions, I am confident that this is a request that will be supported by the Senate. That request will need to go down to the House of Representatives to be agreed to. I will spell out the words of the request when we get to the committee stage, but essentially it is to give an exemption from the assets test to families applying for Austudy if they are holding a health care card. I will say more about it in the committee stage. By and large, as I said at the beginning, the disciplines in these two bills are acceptable to the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>My colleague Senator Spindler was vociferous and firm in his suggestion to the minister in a previous matter in this chamber when he said that, if it was good enough to be spoken about and intended, then it was good enough for the minister to ensure that it was included in the act. I will continue that theme by suggesting that the scrutiny of bills committee feels that way as well. We see a need to properly address that theme again in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that students involved in these schemes have access to the same grievance procedures as other Austudy recipients. Also extended, however, will be the debt management regime which will now include Aboriginal student support, parent awareness programs, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational and educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. No wonder the government is keen to ensure that these sections are covered in a legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague has mentioned something about the repayment rates, and I think I should seriously address this subject. It is important that we remember that last year when the higher education funding bill came to the Senate it was only the Australian Democrats who opposed the increased rates of repayment under the higher education contribution scheme. That is getting the money back faster for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HECS repayment rates were increased from two, three and four per cent of taxable income to three, four and five per cent of taxable income. Coupled with this, the government reduced the income threshold&mdash;the figure at which students are expected to begin to repay their HECS debt&mdash;from $27,748 to $26,402. This is despite the fact that graduate starting salaries are now at an all-time low. This bill seeks to increase the rates of repayment by lowering the threshold for the student financial supplement, the student loans, and that is being characterised as bringing it into line. Some sort of evening-up image is being created there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Democrats were the only people looking out for the interests of Australian students when the loans scheme was first introduced in November 1992. We foresaw the government's efforts to increase the pace in levels of repayment, and today we see reduced that income threshold at which students begin to repay their loan. The first reduction of the threshold was insidious and immoral, and we should not accept this repetition of the same device. It is not evening up; it is a repetition of an insidious and immoral step which was taken some time ago, and of course we oppose those changes. Both the HEC and loans schemes remain a cynical revenue raising attempt by this government. It may see students repaying their debts within a shorter time frame, but it will compound the hardship and the financial pressure that graduates face during the early years of their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers reveal that the government intends to collect $23 million from students through such euphemistically described measures as the `improved administration of Austudy personal income test', which will produce $10 million, apparently. They are the sorts of measures that this bill also collects in that sort of rake-off. Evidence gathered last year highlighted the fact that women will be the hardest hit by these debts and that many women will be repaying the debts well into their late thirties, forties and perhaps even fifties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will carry that debt for life because it is quite simply the case that, despite having obtained tertiary qualifications, some people will not be able to achieve employment at a rate of payment which will enable them to start repayments. These people have been characterised recently by the government as poor risks or bad debts, the image being that somehow or other they have done something evil which would excuse the government taking punitive measures to recover this debt. These people have really not done anything wrong; they have simply attended a tertiary institution and not been in a position to make the contribution that is included in, again, the euphemistically entitled HEC scheme. It is perhaps better described as h-e-x, a curse, rather than H-E-C-S. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure that continues to be applied on people who are recent graduates comes at a time when people are intending to set themselves up for future employment. Whether it be loans to establish employment, housing or family life, it is unfortunate that this coincidence of debt arrives at the same time. We have not seen a proper analysis of the effects of these loans schemes on students, yet the government is happy to increase the rates at which graduates repay these debts. In last night's budget, the maximum amount students can obtain in a loan form was increased to $7,000&mdash;again, an expansion of the possible debt. Some people have characterised this as the generosity of the government. It is hardly generous; it is just enabling people to increase the burden they need to impose on themselves to complete their tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that these measures will make more than $5 million out of students over the next five years. The government is again financing its recovery, it would seem, at the expense of some disadvantaged people. Our amendments, which I will propose at the committee stage, will delete the relevant proposed sections, including reference to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. These measures do not have to mirror changes in the Higher Education Funding Act; there is no legislative nexus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalty changes are also an aspect of this package which concerns us. We will strongly oppose changes to the penalty provisions. It is a cheap shot; I admit that. It is something that one would have to agree with, so we, of course, welcome the changes in this bill that decriminalise failing to notify the department of changes in circumstances. We agree with the extension of time from seven days to 14 days. One could hardly not accept those changes. But associated with them, and linked in in such a way that it is important to discriminate carefully, are clauses of the bill that deal with debt recovery and penalties for failing to notify changes that are not only draconian but legally questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these comments on good advice. We have sought legal advice. It is based not only on the well-referenced Senate scrutiny of bills committee that has received some accolade already in this debate, even in its early stages. It is not only that that committee has noted that the `new arrangement is a retrograde step, imposing a more onerous level of obligation on recipients under the threat of what, in the circumstances, appears to be a rather severe penalty' but I have also contacted lawyers who question the legal basis of this reversal of onus of proof. And that is what it is: a reversal of the onus&mdash;the placing of a further onus on students to be able to prove aspects of this scheme. I quote again from the scrutiny of bills committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee can understand that an oil spill on the Great Barrier Reef or serving salmonella infected food would warrant offences of strict liability because of the serious consequences of such acts. But receiving $10 too much because some change of circumstances was not notified does not . . . warrant strict liability.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that all reasonable people listening to this debate and all reasonable decision makers anywhere would agree with that. The two aspects of behaviour are so far apart from each other that people would have to agree that, on the one hand, strict liability could and should be applied but that, on the other hand, the onus of proving that a change in circumstances which results in an additional few dollars going, as they do in most of these cases, directly into a student's bank account, when this was done in an accidental fashion rather than in a conniving, contriving and guilty fashion, is an onus which is far too heavy to bear and does not warrant strict liability. There are other ways of finding out this; there are other ways of prosecuting this level of misdemeanour, which is hardly a heinous crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the advice received by the scrutiny of bills committee, strict liability offences disregard guilty knowledge and require the accused to raise the defence. This effectively reverses the onus of proof. Not even in relation to the Department of Social Security, where overpayments total $250 million per year, has a strict liability provision been required or thought necessary. Although the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills requested the minister to reconsider the scheme, the committee did not meet with any success. So the Democrats will persevere and move amendments at the committee stage which will deal with those changes, because they are punitive and are deliberately targeting students. For those reasons we will be opposing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this bill allows students to be charged with a strict liability offence for receiving as little as $10 in Austudy overpayments. It replaces a failure to notify offence with an offence of strict liability. I have really repeated what I have said, but I wanted to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the health care cards has been raised by Senator Teague. The amendment which calls on the government to honour its promise that health care card holders would have Austudy means and assets tests waived is a good amendment. It does what ought to be done in this regard. We thought for a while that the minister was going to initiate some change independently, because last year the minister announced that those with health care cards would get Austudy without assets or income testing. But the Department of Employment, Education and Training issued a directive earlier this year reneging on the decision. I would have thought any minister would have been embarrassed by that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, which has been touted by the lower house as a bill merely attending to some housekeeping measures for more effective debt recovery of overpayments. The bill gives a legislative basis to Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme, and concerns itself with departments paying each other back for department mistakes and fraud, irrespective of which, the students and their debts are caught in the middle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of this legislation is to tinker around the edges of recovering more money from students rather than getting to the bottom of why there is so much student debt, why students cannot pay back the money lost, and how the system disempowers them and increases their anxiety about their financial troubles. Students feel more powerless than ever in the education system with burgeoning debts from their direct education costs, such as books, guild fees and living expenses, let alone from the indirect costs of their HECS debts, Austudy overpayment debts and now bigger debts from the Austudy loan supplement. What is made worse about the latter scheme is that it is a far more attractive option to the poorest of students who do not have much of a choice between living on $130 per week or $160, so they are forced into this, which gives them greater hardship in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For them it is clear that a short-term benefit is worth taking up, even if it is not viable for them in the longer term. To give honourable senators an idea of the size of the debt which the government has increased yet again in the budget last night, an average student doing a three-year arts degree with HECS deferred payment and a three-year Austudy loan will have incurred a debt of $30,000. It is a pretty shocking debt for people to begin their life in the work force with, and they will probably not pay the loan off before they have children. Many students take on this loan scheme unaware of the consequences later down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that comes with the scheme is inadequate in explaining to students that they are trading in all their Austudy for debts, when they would be far better off with a greater rate of Austudy that they keep, which is supplemented rather than traded in by a personal loan. Calling the Austudy loan scheme a supplement is a misrepresentation of the word. Any genuine assistance to people with low incomes and assets should not make them compromise on receiving money from the government that they are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about debt management, it should look to reduce student debt. It can do this by raising Austudy to at least the Henderson poverty line, adding in a rent assistance component so there is parity between Austudy and the dole, and also reducing the age for the independent rate of Austudy from 23 years to 18 years of age. There also needs to be an inquiry into the charging of illegal fees on campuses. Students have reported to me incidences of paying fees to use computer equipment and buying their course outlines from their tutors, which is a ludicrous abuse of the system and a further expense for students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also needs to consider parity for recipients and non-recipients of student assistance in the area of tax deduction for self-education expenses. Austudy and Abstudy recipients already get this deduction for expenses over $250, and so should non-recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that this bill has made changes that mean Abstudy and assistance for isolated children recipients can have their decisions reviewed by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as Austudy decisions currently are. This method of review would be greatly improved by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal taking on the discretionary powers afforded by the Social Security Review Tribunal and making it consistent with other tribunals. It is also worth mentioning here that there is no formal review mechanism for HECS payments disputes. There is a strong argument in favour of setting up a HECS liability appeals tribunal based on the SART model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government concerns itself with recovering bad debts, it must recognise that only 72 per cent of debts are recovered and many students simply cannot repay them. For those who are perpetually studying or looking for work, and hence are swapping between the dole and Austudy, their debt should be cancelled after a period. On such low incomes it is criminal to take out $10 or $20, which is a lot of money to such people, to pay a debt that may not be their fault at all. Departments that continually harass low income people for money they cannot pay, which are nominal to department budgets and large amounts to poorer people, probably cost the department more in administration than they do in the amount gained from the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decreased chances of employment for new graduates has surfaced as another debt for government. The Australian Government Actuary has recently found that 16.5 per cent of students will never pay back their HECS debts because they will never earn above the average weekly wage required to start paying the amount back. Concerned community groups have spoken up on this issue. There is a strong belief that the government should consider cancelling the HECS debt after 15 years for women who generally do sporadic paid work and earn lower incomes than their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the government will be perpetually looking at housekeeping issues in education until it looks at the bigger issues of how and why students are falling into more and more debt. It cannot resolve this until it tackles the necessity of giving students a decent amount of Austudy above the Henderson poverty line, bringing that into line with the dole by adding on a rent assistance component, forming an inquiry into the charging of illegal fees on campuses, and other real issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the Student Assistance Amendment Bill. At the outset I would like to say how grateful I am that this amendment on Austudy and the health care card will go through with the support of the Australian Democrats and, I suspect, the Greens&mdash;although I have not had any indication of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to increase the scope of the Student Assistance Act which provides the legislative basis for the Austudy scheme. This bill will give a legislative basis for Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme, which are currently administered by government approved guidelines. The bill also provides for miscellaneous changes to the act, including extension of the debt management scheme and administrative charges to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Albeit assistance for the isolated children's scheme and Abstudy is very worthy, I will concentrate on Austudy. It provides eligible students with income support to complete secondary education and continue on to tertiary education. It is the largest student assistance program. In 1992-93 the Austudy bill came to $1.4 billion and assisted 466,676 students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the Austudy scheme I would like to address the very important issue of low income farm families and their lack of access to Austudy for their dependent student children. As a Department of Employment, Education and Training brochure states, without this financial assistance thousands of students would be unable to complete their education. This is certainly the case for many farm families which consistently have been denied Austudy, due to holding farm related assets over the assets threshold despite having low or zero income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a widespread belief that because a farmer owns a farm worth over $734,000&mdash;with a 50 per cent discount of the net market value taken into account that amount is the Austudy asset limit&mdash;the family can afford to educate its children. This belief is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the average broad acre farm business profit for 1992-93 was $11,000&mdash;and only nine per cent of wool producing farms were in profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 farm indebtedness to financial institutions stood at $15.878 billion. Many farm families struggle to get food on the table, let alone to have the money for textbooks, compulsory student union fees, uniforms and so on. In an attempt to remedy this inequitable situation, my colleague Senator Teague will move a very important and much needed amendment to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment, which the coalition has sought for some     time, will serve to waive the Austudy assets test for all health care card holders. This amendment would be of enormous benefit to farm families which, despite having low or zero incomes&mdash;and in recognition of that are issued with health care cards by the Department of Social Security&mdash;fail to meet the assets test. This amendment would enable hundreds of rural students to complete their secondary and tertiary education, which otherwise would be impossible. In the last budget the government made a commitment to exempt all health care card holders from the assets test. Then, in callous fashion, it broke that commitment and in the process smashed the expectations of rural students which the government, with its budget promise, had built up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numbers of students planned their studies for this year on the basis of information distributed by DEET. Their plans were cruelly shattered when this budget promise was revoked. Whether a broken promise or a bureaucratic bungle&mdash;to use Minister Free's phrase, `a spectacular administrative blunder'&mdash;the fact remains that hundreds of students had their study plans and hopes for the future thrown into turmoil as a result of the government's action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give a brief account of this spectacular administrative blunder because it would serve to illustrate the indifference of this government towards the plight of rural students. It shows a minister not on top of his portfolio and presents a department that has subsequently been revealed to be utterly deficient in its self-monitoring, accounting, record keeping and information technology systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known by now that DEET issued at least four documents last year which stated explicitly that health care card holders would have the Austudy assets test waived. This departmental material included a 1993-94 departmental budget kit highlighting changes that would affect DEET; a DEET press release heralding the changes in policy; and, most misleading for students, the Austudy application and guide and the 1994 Austudy guide to student finance. It was not one blunder; it was not two; it was four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the minister being embarrassed about the lack of support he got from his department. One thing I cannot understand is why the government did not go in and support the minister in his quest to bring forward Austudy based on the health care card assets test. It was a matter of serious embarrassment for Mr Free, and I believe it will probably affect his political career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the estimates hearings I placed a series of questions on notice as to how the department could have issued such a volume of material if this was contrary to government policy. I have never received a satisfactory answer. DEET's bungling created a great deal of confusion for students who accepted the department's advice in good faith and accordingly made plans for their further education&mdash;plans that, for many, were shattered when the department belatedly realised its huge error and imposed the assets test on Austudy applicants holding health care cards on the arbitrarily appointed date of 7 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add further confusion, Minister Free's office issued a statement on 15 February 1994 to the effect that `the government wanted to honour its policy but, at this stage, is not clear whether it can', as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. If the government wanted to honour its policy, I cannot see any reason why it did not. Mr Free was once again left out on a limb, getting no support from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question of Senator Schacht, representing Minister Free, on 21 February in an attempt to put an end to the confusion. Senator Schacht read a brief from the minister which stated, in essence, that it was not the intention of the government to allow all health care card holders exemption from the assets test; rather, it was a budget measure to allow health care card holders to fast-track access to Austudy on the grounds that they had already met the means test administered by the Department of Social Security. Again, what Mr Free wanted was obviously not what the government wanted. Mr Free's brief also stated that he had ordered an urgent internal investigation into how DEET's quality control measures failed to pick up this diversion from the intent of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite placing several questions on notice at estimates, I was never apprised of the findings of the urgent internal investigation. What was also never explained to me was what policy was being referred to in the minister's statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that `the government wanted to honour its policy but, at this stage, is not clear whether it can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the policy was to fast-track Austudy payments for health care card holders, why would the government have difficulty in meeting that? Or was the policy actually that all health care card holders would be exempt from the Austudy assets test as explicitly stated in DEET's literature? What does seem likely is that at that stage the minister did not know what the correct policy was. During the debate on a matter of public importance concerning Austudy in the House of Representatives on 2 March moved by my colleague the shadow minister for schools, vocational education and training, Kevin Andrews, Minister Free's explanation of the bungle was that it flowed from a departmental misinterpretation of a budget decision and that the original budget decision stood unaltered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the minister was laying the blame squarely on DEET for, firstly, misunderstanding the budget decision and, secondly, promulgating this misunderstanding through the community. Yet how is this assertion reconciled with the secretary's report, which I received in response to my estimates question? It stated that the budget kit and the Austudy application and guide were prepared in the branches responsible for these matters and were cleared up the line in the department, including the secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Free and his office then cleared the documents. At least eight separate clearance processes were involved. The other material was cleared at branch level, in the department and by Minister Free. How on earth can Minister Free blame the department for this massive bungle when he approved all the department's publications? Maybe he, like his colleague, only read the cover and not the contents of these documents, because that is probably the only explanation that is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important point to be raised is that according to that same secretary's report the Department of Finance expressed concerns regarding the use of health care cards when determining eligibility for Austudy as far back as 1 November last year. Yet the department took over three months to act in response to the advice of the Department of Finance. During this time, a meeting took place between Finance and DEET on 1 December 1993, when Finance raised further concerns about this matter. The secretary's report stated that it would be `necessary to apply an assets test to those health care card holders known to be farmers or other self-employed people.' However, DEET did nothing in response to these concerns. The report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was not brought to the attention of anyone above branch head level. The assistant secretary concerned did not bring the issues to the attention of ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the meeting of 1 December 1993, a circular was prepared for student assistance centres indicating that an assets test should be applied where it could be reasonably expected that healthcare card holders had not passed a similar assets test to that of Austudy. Although this was cleared with the branch head, it was apparently never sent.</PARA>
<PARA>One has to ask: why was this important memo never sent? The secretary's report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more detailed circular was sent on 7 February. A public announcement was not made because only a small number of people were affected, but many people could become confused by believing that it affected them when it did not.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what a small number is, but up to 200 or 300 people could be affected by this decision. I would suggest that far more students were confused when official Austudy advice such as the application form and financial guides stated that possession of health care cards would mean exemption from the Austudy assets test. A public announcement would have gone some way to clear up the widespread confusion in the community over this matter. The secretary's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this matter came to the attention of Minister Free he wrote on 15 February to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the other ministers concerned, but did not obtain an agreement to permit all healthcare card holders to be assessed for Austudy without an assets test in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Free's understanding to secure such an agreement can be seen for what it is&mdash;a last ditch attempt by a minister to move himself from the mess created by his department and his office. According to Senator Schacht at estimates hearings earlier this year, 100 students had successfully applied for Austudy with the assets test waived. According to a departmental officer, 20 students were thought to be adversely affected when the government reneged on the department's commitment to waive the assets test from 7 February onwards. But one would imagine that more students than that could have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put several questions on notice in estimates in an attempt to secure an estimate of the cost of waiving the assets test for all health care card holders, but I have never been given answers. The fact now is that the assets test will be removed for families that are holders of the health card. It is clear that that amendment will be carried by the Senate. That amendment will go to the House of Representatives, where it will be presented. If the government does not give any support to Mr Free to stop a very embarrassing occasion taking place with this amendment being rejected by the House of Representatives and being sent back here, then I believe Mr Free has no option but to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen in the white paper that many children of farmers are going to be removed from jobsearch allowance and are going to be placed on a training levy. That training levy will be subject again to an assets test. Farmers' children will not be eligible for Austudy and they will not be eligible for jobsearch allowance at a time when the average indebtedness of property is massive and at a time when only eight or nine per cent of them are making a profit, with the other 91 or 92 per cent making a loss. Their children will not be able to get Austudy or receive a training allowance, so they have a double jeopardy against them. That is most unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told time and again by the government that it wants a clever country, that it wants people in training and that it wants regional development. What better way to develop this nation than having children from farms working as agricultural scientists and agricultural economists? They are going to be the future for regional Australia. If there is no farming in regional Australia, then there will be no regional Australia&mdash;the heart will be ripped out of this country. By taking Austudy away from farmers' children and then denying them a training wage, the government is ripping the very heart out of this country: it is to fly completely in the face of its policies on training. It seems that everyone else in this country can receive a training allowance or some form of jobsearch allowance under some program, except farmers' children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with two bills today&mdash;the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. It is the second bill that I want to speak to today. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that it will `facilitate the reciprocal recovery of overpayments covered by the three main Commonwealth Acts dealing with income maintenance'. They are the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the bill, I do not want to look at the provisions of it but, rather, to make a few comments on social security legislation in general. As veterans legislation closely mirrors that of social security, I am sure my comments will be just as relevant to that legislation. No doubt they will have some relevance to the Student Assistance Act as well, although that has been covered very adequately by my colleague Senator Bell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far this year, with just six weeks of sitting, the parliament has already dealt with two major social security bills. Before us today is yet another bill amending the Social Security Act, and in our next sitting week we are scheduled to debate the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. With more and more changes being made to the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it seems to me that we are beginning to weave an even more tangled web of legislation and regulations. They are becoming unintelligible to the average person, despite the many attempts to convert the act into so-called `plain English' style. It is frightening to think what must be taught in English lessons at school these days&mdash;I will have to ask Senator Bell to explain it to me&mdash;if our current Social Security Act falls within the definition of plain English. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bell and I accept his explanation. Late last year my attention was drawn to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> entitled `Social security rewrite `a failure'.' It seems that, in the course of conducting a hearing on a compensation case involving the Department of Social Security, judges of the full Federal Court encountered great difficulty in sifting through the relevant sections of the act. One possible reason for that is that the judges themselves were illiterate, but I suspect that that was not the problem. I suspect that it was the plain English version of the act that these judges were having difficulty with. They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably, the replacement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the plain English version&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consists of a maze of provisions made the more complex by prolix definitions, provisos and exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA>The judges concluded that, despite being a plain English version, no-one seriously believed that a lay person could ever master the act unaided. I think the judges included themselves in the definition of lay persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that anyone can throw brickbats at legislation and that it is easy to criticise. I acknowledge that the act is attempting to implement a highly complex range of programs. As those judges conceded, the first requirement of legislation is that it express with clarity the rules the parliament intends. However, the point we need to keep in mind is that every day there are thousands of people trying to make sense of this legislation and the interconnected regime of payments it establishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there are 20,000 staff members of the Department of Social Security. I have great sympathy for the DSS staff. They are the ones who are daily required to work within this tangled web, to make correct decisions based on the legislation and to be able to justify those decisions. Of course, they have the department's guide to the administration of the act to assist them in that task. I have not read it in detail but, if honourable senators take the trouble to look through that guide, they will see that it is a fairly complex document, running to some 2,000 pages in length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the act that we have put through mean more courses for these DSS staff, who are being trained to be multiskilled and find that when they return to the job, after rotating to other positions, all the rules and regulations governing that particular section have changed. These changes are not just minor adjustments to levels of payment or to the conditions of those payments. They also include the introduction of major new programs and the abolition or modification of others. I am well aware that staff at DSS offices are already under great stress; they have to deal with more people today than ever before. While we continue to shift the goal posts we are making their jobs much more difficult, and we are creating an environment of stress and confusion in which these people are required to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the problems the recipients themselves must have in trying to come to grips with this legislation and its myriad intricate provisions. Some may have had an application for a pension or benefit turned down and want to try to understand why they failed to qualify. Some may be thinking about lodging an appeal against a particular decision made by the department. Others may simply want to understand what payments are available, what conditions those allowances are paid under, and what the individual's obligations are under the current system. What chance do these people have when the Federal Court judges are struggling to understand the legislation? The answer is: probably no hope at all. I wonder how many people have failed to comply with one of the requirements for the payment of a pension or benefit because they did not know the requirement existed or, if they did, did not fully understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is the personal effect that changes to the legislation have on people who are affected. The best example of this is the government's change to the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares held by pensioners. There is a real feeling of uncertainty among the entire pensioner community with regard to their retirement incomes, and this comes at a time in their lives when certainty of income is absolutely paramount to them. We need to take note not only of the change but also of the process of change which affects these people. This is particularly true when making changes to the rules governing age pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group affected by the complexity of the Social Security Act is composed of the people here, the legislators. We have seen a number of examples recently where the intent of amendments has been clear but the complexity of the act has made those amendments very difficult to draft. With the home child-care allowance, the opposition actually requested the government's assistance in drafting highly complex amendments. I can understand its asking for that help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, those involved in the welfare sector are affected by the changes made to the social security legislation. We know that many groups operating in this sector do so on inadequate budgets and deal with many more people than they are really equipped to handle. Constant changes to the legislation are simply making that job much harder. One person affected is Michael Raper, who is from the Welfare Rights Centre in Sydney. Last year, Michael put out a paper entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Welfare yachts and band-aids: the cause and effects of crippling complexity in the social security system</EMPHASIS>. I would certainly encourage honourable senators, and indeed anyone in the press or public galleries with an interest in the social security area, to read this paper. I would be happy to provide a copy to them if they would like one. The report contains some real-life examples of clients with whom the Welfare Rights Centre has dealt that clearly illustrate the sorts of problems I have been talking about. I seek leave to have the document incorporated in<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Liang and his search for the elusive payment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After having been paid Sickness Allowance for six months, Liang's eligibility was reviewed by a Commonwealth Medical Officer. The CMO considered Liang to be fit for light work, of up to 15 hours per week, and also considered his incapacity, a lower back condition, to be permanent. Liang's Sickness Allowance was therefore cancelled, and he was asked to apply for Disability Support Pension. Liang also applied for Special Benefit so as to guarantee income support while the claim was considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liang was found not to qualify for DSP, as he was not considered to have the required 20% impairment. Special Benefit was cancelled and Liang was asked to claim JSA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he registered at the CES, Liang took with him the DSS letter which explained he was no longer entitled to Sickness Allowance, due to the permanent nature of his back condition and his apparent fitness for light work. Liang's English is poor, so he felt this would explain why he was claiming JSA. The CES's reaction was to issue Liang with a form on which his own doctor could stipulate whether he was, in fact, fit for light duties, as the DSS letter clearly stated the CMO's opinion to be at odds with Liang's own doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liang had the form completed, took it back to the CES and was informed that he wouldn't be registered unless he signed a form disclaiming his own doctor's opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liang went back to DSS to explain, and was told that he was not eligible for anything if he "refused" to look for work. Liang then contacted the Welfare Rights Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After intervention, DSS accepted that at the time his Sickness Allowance was cancelled Liang had no capacity to work due to the flaring up of his back condition. Fortunately, Sickness Allowance was restored and back payment was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, Liang faced almost two months of confusion, numerous visits to DSS, the CES, and his doctor and countless calls to the Welfare Rights Centre. By the time he contacted us he was firmly convinced that the only way to secure income support was to lie to the CES which he was not prepared to do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many clients confronted with the reality that the CES will in all probability not be able to refer them for jobs anyway, sign medical certificate disclaimers despite their view that they could not present themselves to a prospective employer as fit for work. Such manipulation of the system promotes cynicism in the community regarding the role of the CES and the impact of DSS policy. It is those who do not show that cynicism who suffer the effects of the system's complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Neville's Hardship&mdash;and the Hardship Rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neville's claim for Job Search Allowance was refused as his assets precluded entitlement. The assets affecting consisted of a half share in the property he owns with his estranged wife.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the nature of the questions on the claim forms completed by Neville, he was given no opportunity to explain that the property in question was then the subject of property settlement negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neville believed there to be no way around the apparently black and white JSA assets test, so he proceeded to live on his savings and hoped only to be unemployed for a short time. Seven weeks later when he was down to $600 in the bank, a friend advised him to ring us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We advised Neville to lodge a claim form for payment under the Hardship Rules. This claim was processed quickly, but payment can only be made under these Rules from the date the Hardship Rules claim was lodged unless "special circumstances" apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neville's experience of DSS staff not automatically turning their minds to any possible means of paying a client with either no or inadequate current sources of income is not rare. A typical response to a client mentioning actual or potential hardship is to give advice regarding Special Benefit, rather than to examine whether the Hardship Rules may apply. The effect is that often only the persistent, well-informed client is given access to information that may secure payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A universal claim for social security income support would have solved Neville's problem, by placing the onus on DSS staff to consider the full range of possibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fatima gets the Jobskills blues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fatima attended a social security office for advice as her husband had just been accepted into a Jobskills labour market program, organised by the CES. He had been in receipt of JSA. Fatima advised that her husband "had a full-time job" through CES Jobskills, and asked what other assistance they may be eligible for, as the wages were low. She was advised that she should have a continuing entitlement to Additional Family Payment and was informed that her husband should advise that he had started full-time work on his next continuation form, stating the date of commencement. He did so. Fatima's husband's JSA was cancelled accordingly, and Fatima continued to receive Additional Family Payment. Family disposable income had not increased despite her husband's 40 hour working week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three months later, when Fatima's husband was chatting to his workmates about their financial problems, it came to light that some of their wives were eligible to receive JSA. Fatima, who had been desperately seeking work, claimed JSA and was found to have an entitlement due to the low rate of pay under the Jobskills program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fatima's experience exemplifies the tendency of many DSS staff to take a minimalist approach to responding to client enquiries. This is understandable to a degree, considering the complexity of the system about which clients seek advice. For Fatima to have elicited the responses that would have given her comprehensive, accurate advice so as to maximise her entitlement was virtually impossible given her poor English and the pressure under which counter staff operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">William&mdash;DSS proves its efficiency!</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">William, who is 83, was called into DSS so as to invite him to claim Age Pension, as he had been in Australia, receiving Special Benefit, for the required ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On examining William's passport, it was noticed that William had been out of Australia for three brief periods over the last six years. William was advised that he had been ineligible for payment during those absences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerned and distressed, he visited the Welfare Rights Centre. We assured him that DSS would not take any action without interviewing him, as DSS had no information about the reasons for his absences&mdash;information crucial to establishing whether the overpayment in fact came under one of the 18 categories of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The very next day, DSS efficiency excelled itself and William received a letter advising him of a substantial overpayment and requesting immediate repayment. Two weeks later recovery commenced from his Special Benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vigour with which DSS currently approaches debt recovery, even where the client is elderly and in fragile health is cause for concern. As William pointed out, the Department goes to great pains reviewing his eligibility for Special Benefit, and he appreciates the need carefully to examine his situation from time to time. Had similar efficiency and attention been exercised when William's overseas absences came to light, his distressing experience would have been avoided. In the end we were able to assist William to demonstrate that on each occasion that he left Australia, he in fact remained eligible for Special Benefit and that no overpayment had occurred, therefore no debt existed. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Cases raise profound questions about the system</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What sort of a system is it that throws up cases like this with disturbing regularity. Is this the system our Ministers boast so proudly about as being one of the finest in the world? This is a system that has taken "selectivity" and the Australian practice of "targeting those most in need" to extremes that are no longer workable. This is a system that has become far too complex for its own good. It is a system that is riddled with anomalies that get compounded every time there is yet another nip here, or budgetary tuck there. It is a system that is beyond the comprehension of many, many DSS counter staff and many at higher levels. It forces staff into defensive aggressive attempts to hide their own (at times understandable) ignorance and embarrassment. And it forces elaborate, daunting and intrusive questionnaires onto clients seeking mountains of information to satisfy the voracious appetite of the complex monster we have created.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a system in which even the advantages of beneficial measures (like the new additional free area for income from earnings and earnings credit scheme for allowees) are lost both to the client and the system because they are now so complex that people do not understand them and therefore can not take advantage of them. It is a system which takes the presence of five relatively senior DSS officers at a Senate committee hearing just to try and explain to six Senators the effect of one would-be Budget change (the retention of 16 year old at home students in the Family Payment system instead of in Austudy).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But most importantly, it is a system in which people fail to get income support to which they are entitled; in which people get saddled with debts that are overpayments but not debts; in which people are so disenfranchised by change and complexity that they can't understand, and can't check and can't get help so that the value of an otherwise fair and good appeal system is diminished to the point of inaccessibility and irrelevance for so many. They won't start the process for the simple reason that it's all too complex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are we to go on with each and every Budget "targeting (still further) to those most in need", compounding complexity with more layers of complexity, building even more anomalies into the system as we `refine' it still further? Are we to go on accepting and accommodating measures which are either motivated primarily by a savings target or were caused by the need partially to fix up problems caused by earlier cuts and which, although rationalised in some policy garment, have little policy merit at all?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Michael concludes his paper with a number of suggestions for reform of the social security system. Really, I think this is the most important part of what I want to say today, because they are very practical suggestions he makes. I briefly conclude by outlining two of them. Firstly, in the light of the complex eligibility criteria for the various pensions, benefits and allowances, he advocates the introduction of a universal claim form. Under such a system, clients would provide the department with the necessary personal and financial information, and an experienced DSS officer would then determine which payment, if any, the person was entitled to. This would avoid the problem of people being confused as to which pension or benefit they may be eligible for and applying incorrectly, and would make it far easier for those with English language difficulties or psychiatric or intellectual disabilities to access the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation put forward is for a comprehensive review to be undertaken. I know that we all get very frustrated with the number of reviews that we have, but surely this is one which is far overdue. It would be a review designed to develop a simpler system, free from anomalies and protected from indiscriminate budgetary cutbacks. In line with comments I have already made, I certainly support the undertaking of such a review. I notice that in the House of Representatives, some time back, the Labor member for Moreton, Garrie Gibson, pointed out that DSS sends out some 80 million letters per year to its clients. He called on the Minister for Social Security to conduct a review of that DSS correspondence. I would argue that the enormous number of letters being sent out are yet another symptom of an overly complex system, a symptom which would disappear once the complexity had been removed by an overall review of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee delivered on 31 March 1994, concerning Tasmania's criminal code, has attracted a lot of superficial attention. Its decision highlights the need for all Australians to call on their parliamentarians to get off the gee-whizzer of international treaty making. Whilst on the gee-whizzer the rider has fun and a sense of great exhilaration. However, immediately afterwards, the rider tries to walk in a straight line and wobbles all over the place. Similarly, our domestic politics and constitutional arrangements have been put into a spin by this unhealthy fantasy for international treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many flaws in relation to the determination of the human rights committee. Its definition of `privacy', for example, would allow incest to be decriminalised. Similarly, its definition of the word `sex' has been expanded to include sexual preference, as opposed to distinction on the basis of gender. Today's debate, however, is not about the tortured logic and the gross flaws in the decision. The purpose of my comments today relates to the distortions put forward by Mr Nicholas Toonen, the complainant. Indeed, it is quite apparent that the committee accepted his assertions on face value without taking into account the indisputable evidence that Tasmania sought to have placed before it indicating that Mr Toonen handles the truth carelessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sorry reflection on the committee that it did not abide by its own rules of fairness and justice. Article 14 of the United Nations convention requires that people ought to have the right to examine, or have examined, the witnesses brought against them. If this procedure had been followed and Mr Toonen had had to give his evidence under oath, I have no doubt whatsoever that the complaint would have been dismissed and Mr Toonen would now be facing a charge of perjury or a charge of seeking to pervert the course of justice. The fact that Tasmania was not given the full opportunity to cross-examine Mr Toonen and to argue its case reflects in this terribly flawed decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the real purpose of my address today is to deal with the outrageous assertions made by Mr Toonen. He asserted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it may also be relevant to note that Tasmania has a history of enforcing its anti-gay criminal laws far in excess of its comparable jurisdictions. Tasmania was the last jurisdiction in the British Empire to hang men convicted of homosexual acts. In the 19th and 20th centuries it has recorded the highest prosecution rate and the highest rate of capital punishment for homosexual sexual activity of any Australian jurisdiction and it is the only Australian jurisdiction in which women have been prosecuted for homosexual acts.</PARA>
<PARA>The authority for this assertion was a book by Robert French entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Camping by a billabong</EMPHASIS>. It is a book about gay and lesbian stories from Australian history. Australians ought to be aware that the front cover of the book shows fully exposed men and young boys standing side by side next to a billabong. The book, in my view, is more propagandistic than it is historical, but that is beside the point. Mr Toonen seeks to rely on this book to make all the assertions I have just referred to. However, the book he quotes does not support any of the statements made. Whereas Mr French said in his book that he knew of only one case where two women were faced with a charge of indecency, Mr Toonen liberally translates that into being the only Australian case in which women have been prosecuted. Clearly, that is a distortion and a misquote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in his book Mr French said that Tasmania was the last jurisdiction in the Australian colonies to execute somebody for the crime of buggery. Mr Toonen translates that into being the last colony in the British Empire. Once again, that is a distortion. Further research indicates that there has been no execution in the state of Tasmania this century for homosexual activities. So Mr Toonen has sought to mislead again. In fact, there have been only three executions in the state of Tasmania this century and they were in 1913, 1922 and 1946. All these executions were for the crime of murder. Tasmania's record in relation to hanging is better than that of other states such as Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research indicates that there have been no executions for any crimes other than murder in Tasmania since 1875. Research also indicates that the last executions which appear to have been for homosexual activities were those of Whitnalder and Collins in 1863. This case is mentioned by Mr French. Although Mr French states that Collins was executed for buggery, the official records say that his crime was sodomy. It should be noted that the term `sodomy' was being used at that time to refer to a wide range of activities. The record is not clear as to which variant of sodomy had been practised in Collins' case. Further, it should be noted that Whitnalder was already under a sentence of death in New South Wales for the crime of rape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr French also referred in his book to an 1828 case of a Samuel Cox. Research indicates that French should have been referring to the case of Cog, whose sentence was commuted on the ground that his offence had not been properly proven. As though this attempt at rewriting history were not enough, the complainant, Mr Toonen, then makes a most outrageous allegation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since lodging communication 488/1992 I have lost my employment partly as a result of this communication.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stopped working for the Tasmanian Aids Council on the 2 July, 1993 after 4 1/2 years employment as the result of the external review of the council which recommended the termination of my employment. This review was imposed on the Aids Council by the Tasmanian Government through its Department of Community and Health Services.</PARA>
<PARA>He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the actions by the Department . . . were motivated by its concerns over my high profile complaint to the U.N. Human Rights Committee and my gay activism . . . At no time was there any question of my work performance being unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Mr Toonen's assertions. Let us move to the facts. The review of which Mr Toonen speaks was not imposed on the Tasmanian AIDS Council by the Tasmanian government. It resulted from concerns about the council which were expressed to the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations by various individuals and then passed on by the federation to the Commonwealth government. A review was then commissioned jointly by the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the state Department of Community and Health Services with, and I stress, the agreement of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations and the Tasmanian AIDS Council. Two reviewers were appointed, neither of whom were employed by the Tasmanian state government. They were Ruth Cotton, a Commonwealth employee, and Bill Whittaker from the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement that the review recommended the termination of Mr Toonen's employment is false. The recommendation was that the position of general manager be retitled `executive officer' and a new duty statement and selection criteria be approved. The recommendation necessarily envisaged the termination of Mr Toonen's job but the review expressly stated that Mr Toonen was not precluded from applying for the new position. As it turned out, for his own reasons, Mr Toonen did not apply. The termination of his services as general manager was negotiated before the Tasmanian Industrial Commission and he received appropriate severance money as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons behind the recommendations of these two independent reviewers with whom the state government had nothing to do whatsoever included the following: the council was in need of a greater sense of purpose and direction with more leadership being provided by the senior staff officer; consistent with this, the work of the senior staff position in the council needed to include activities such as the development of policy, strategic planning, the setting of priorities, negotiating with other organisations and government and media work; and, Mr Toonen's dealings with other staff had not been good, leading to a high turnover and generally low morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reviewers clearly expressed dissatisfaction with a number of aspects of Mr Toonen's work yet he boldly and falsely asserted to the United Nations that there was no dissatisfaction with his work performance. The AIDS council of Tasmania did not disagree with the recommendations of the two independent reviewers. The AIDS council, however, was slow to implement the recommendations, therefore it was told to pursue the implementation of the review or face the possible consequences of a financial penalty. The deadline imposed was the very deadline appointed by the two independent reviewers who, I stress again, were not appointed by the Tasmanian government. All of these factors clearly place a very different complexion upon the termination of Mr Toonen's employment. Until now, Mr Toonen has been able to be seen as a knight in shining armour and the Tasmanian government as the dragon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what one's view on this debate, the sort of distortion that was peddled before the human rights committee is completely unacceptable and needs to be condemned by all fair-minded, thinking Australians. What is of great concern to me is that the decision of the human rights committee simply regurgitates Mr Toonen's distortions. I will quote from paragraph 7.1. Concerning Mr Toonen, the committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his employment was terminated . . . following an external review of the Councils work which had been imposed by the Tasmanian Government through the Department of Community and Health Services.</PARA>
<PARA>That, clearly, as has been shown, is incorrect. However, the committee did not deem it appropriate to say that such evidence was challenged and that it could not make determination as to who was telling the truth. Instead it simply repeated assertions as presented by Mr Toonen and accepted them at face value. It further regurgitated the distortion that at no time had there been any question of Mr Toonen's work performance being unsatisfactory. Clearly, that was also wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Toonen, in his submission, did not tell the United Nations that the former impasse that had been reached in the Tasmanian parliament, when he first lodged his complaint concerning the changing of the criminal laws, had been resolved by the people of Tasmania by electing a lower house which was committed to the retention of the current law. Yet the United Nations stated in its decision that it noted the existence of an impasse between the two houses of the parliament. There is no such impasse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole decision is flawed, is biased, is not based on the normal principles of natural justice, the right to a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination, the right to a public hearing and all those other things that fair-minded Australians have come to expect from any impartial and appropriately constituted judicial body or board of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the media will also take into account what I have said today and reconsider their attitude and their handling of this matter so that it is dealt with on a fair and equitable basis. Whether the decision of the Tasmanian government not to change its criminal laws be right or wrong, the simple fact is that the Tasmanian government was elected on that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I am sure that I speak for the views of all Australians when I say that every party to a dispute, whether it be an individual, a state, a country or an international body, should be granted the fundamental right of having its case not only heard but also properly considered before a decision is made. There is no doubt that it is this fundamental right which forms the cornerstone of every system of judicial equality and it is those fundamentals that have been overlooked by the United Nations in this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust my brief contribution today will expose the partiality and inconsistencies that are contained in Mr Toonen's submission and reflected so pathetically and extensively in the United Nations findings on this issue, and will at least go some way to balancing the debate. For Australia's sake I trust that the Labor Party will not seek to abuse the external affairs power in this matter. The threshold question surely must be: do we believe in government for the people, by the people, or government by an external body? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of public importance regarding a document which this government has prepared at some expense and in great haste. The document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Action Plan</EMPHASIS>, was tabled at the fiftieth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 22 February 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a measure of the times and priorities of this government that the national action plan was not tabled in the Australian parliament. We should make no mistake: this national action plan is a document of some importance. It sets out in detail how the government aims to incorporate Australia's legal system further within the treaties, conventions and human rights committees of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament did not have a chance to debate the government's plans and to consider the numerous proposals that the government has put forward. After all, one of the basic human rights of a free people is that the government consult with them on such issues, not with United Nations public servants and the UNophiles in the Department of Foreign Affairs. After all, it is proposing substantial changes to the legal structure of this country. For example, and more specifically, surely it is a basic human right of the Australian people that they be asked whether United Nations human rights committees should be involved in Australian domestic disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish today to make a few general comments on this document before looking at some of the more fundamental matters which emerge. In the first place, the national action plan is one of the pre-eminent expressions of the so-called `New Internationalism' so beloved of Senator Evans and of the foreign policy which he pursues. How typical of Senator Evans that he boasts in his press release of 23 February this year that Australia is the first nation to formally state its position on human rights at the UNCHR in a comprehensive statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps some of the other nations were more circumspect because they are more aware of the complexities and difficulties in this area than Senator Evans appears to be. There is no consideration in the document that signing new conventions, removing reservations on existing conventions and encouraging appeals to UN human rights committees might involve weighty national interests which could at times conflict with the overriding desire of Senator Evans to appear a good international citizen and to be patted on the back by the diplomats and permanent officers of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be some impression that these UN conventions are holy writ. The ICCPR, negotiated over a period of 18 years between nations of the free world, the communist world and the Third World, says nothing of the right to private property. While it affirms the right to participate in elections, the communist parties did not want any mention of the right to have competing parties or even competing candidates, so that element was not mentioned in the specific article. Some countries even objected to the right to change one's faith, so in the article on freedom of religion this specific right is not mentioned. These documents simply are not holy writ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second general comment I wish to make turns on the shallow philosophical assumptions which underpin the whole document. For example, the national action plan makes the incredibly bold statement that Australia rejects the view that there is any hierarchy of human rights. We are all in favour of human rights, but the fact of the matter is that the whole area of human rights is fraught with complexities, and for this document to glibly say there is no hierarchy of human rights is to ignore the very difficult issues involved in advancing human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the major human rights debates occurring at the international level at this very time. Professor Phillip Alston and others have drawn attention to the fact that there is a proliferation of human rights. Some include what they call the right to tourism. How could that be more important or at the same level as the right to due process under law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A well-known expert in the area, Mr Theodore Meron, in his recent article entitled `On a hierarchy of human rights', considers this debate at some length. He points out, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The characterisation of certain rights as hierarchically superior may also be seen as a response to the proliferation of human rights instruments, sometimes of poor quality and uncertain legal value.</PARA>
<PARA>He argues, in weighing up the pros and cons, that the international community should direct its efforts to finding a distinction between ordinary and higher rights and the legal significance of this distinction, steps that would contribute significantly to resolving conflicts between rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many human rights problems today involve this very conflict: the right to freedom of expression versus the right to a fair trial; the rights of parents versus the rights of children; the rights of women versus the rights to maintain religious or cultural traditions. One of the important issues in Australia is how these rights are to be balanced and by whom. Are they to be balanced by Australian courts and judges or are they to be balanced by UN committees? If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his fellow republicans wish to allow Australian human rights matters to be considered by UN committees, they should at least consider the value of establishing a hierarchy of rights to direct the decisions of these committees rather than giving them unbridled power to balance these rights in any way they choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give honourable senators another example. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, will be aware of this. One of the debates occurring is on the issue of national sovereignty versus the right to self-determination for indigenous peoples. The right to self-determination, which is contained in article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as in a number of other international treaties, has applied in the past to colonies and peoples under the rule of a foreign power. However, the right to self-determination, according to one view, includes the right of people to determine their own international status by deciding whether to remain part of an existing sovereign state or by seceding from it and forming their own nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has recently argued for the inclusion of the right to self-determination for indigenous peoples in the proposed United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. Australian representatives have submitted that the right to self-determination should be reconciled with the principle of territorial integrity of states so that it does not give rise to indigenous peoples seceding and forming their own states. That is a very important issue. As I understand it, the Australian government's interpretation of the scope of self-determination is limited to a form of self-management and participation in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two serious problems arising from Australia's position. Firstly, by using the expression `self-determination' in this limited sense, it will certainly raise the expectations of those who understand self-determination in its broader sense as allowing peoples to decide their own international status. Secondly, even if Australia succeeds in achieving recognition in the declaration on the rights of indigenous people that self-determination cannot be achieved at the expense of the territorial sovereignty of states, this does not mean that such a limitation will be imported into other treaties which also include a right to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recently seen how the meaning of provisions in human rights treaties can change over time. The UN Human Rights Committee now interprets the word `sex' to include `sexual orientation', even though that was probably never considered when the covenant was first drafted. I ask: how will this limited interpretation of the meaning of self-determination be interpreted by UN committees in the future? By recognising the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination, we may ultimately be recognising their right to secede from Australia. In setting out its national action plan, the government failed to reiterate strongly its position that self-determination could under no circumstances include the right to secession from Australia. This, in itself, I believe, may be taken as a signal of the government's negotiating position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I wish to address is that there is barely any recognition in the document of the many matters which involve significant constitutional issues for Australia. One of the major problems with UN treaties is that they fail to recognise adequately the nature of a federal state. It is interesting that the US, when it signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, insisted on a detailed and complex federal clause. When the US decided to ratify the ICCPR with the federal clause, the Australian government had by that time removed the federal clause which had been inserted by the Fraser government and replaced it with a mere federal statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the national action plan, it points out there are some 28 ILO conventions which have been identified by the government as suitable for ratification. That will apparently be with consultation, or so it says. That, of course, would be a change&mdash;ILO conventions were ratified prior to the last election without any significant consultation. But note that the states will be only consulted; their approval is not necessary. States are part of the federal compact and, given the fact that these treaties often change the balance of power between federal and state governments, it is a gross abuse of position for the federal government to feel it can freely alter this balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more amazing proposals in this document is the section in which the government, in effect, indicates its desire to encourage appeals to UN human rights committees. What a disgraceful abdication of national sovereignty! There are no worries here about the philosophy of the Australia Act severing appeals to outside tribunals; and no considerations as to whether these committees themselves which, in my view, fail to meet the most minimal standards of judicial process, should be giving views on Australian disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the surprising aspects of the debate on UN human rights committees is that the government denies that its action in this area, together with the ratification of a vast range of UN and ILO treaties, in some way impinges on national sovereignty. I would have thought the whole idea of Senator Evans's new internationalist agenda is to erode national sovereignty. Indeed, Senator Chris Schacht, when he was chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, produced a report in which it was stated, `There has been a tendency for the United Nations to limit national sovereignty.' Senator Schacht has no argument. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, this evolution increasingly demands a reconsideration of the principle of national sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">United Nations conventions now covering a wide range of activities inevitably change the character of domestic institutions, alter domestic legislation and extend accountability beyond the usual domestic constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> debate in which I took part with the Attorney-General and Justice Evatt, Don Rothwell, lecturer in law at the University of Sydney, observed that there is a perception that we are being governed by the United Nations or by various international conferences. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that every time we enter into a treaty we are, to a certain extent, giving away our sovereignty. But that is the price we pay for being a good international citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>So he does not argue the principle which is the driving force behind the new internationalist agenda of Senator Evans. The new internationalist agenda is to national sovereignty as a rat is to cheese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the well-respected US current affairs monthly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commentary</EMPHASIS> pointed out the very problems which are involved when countries sign up for these treaties. Inevitably there is an erosion of national sovereignty. It is very interesting, in conclusion, that Senator Evans and the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, now attempt to deny the driving principle underlying the government's new internationalism. This is not surprising. Having attempted to fan the nationalist flames in their republican debates, will Mr Keating, Senator Evans and Michael Lavarch be burnt as the Australian people understand how foolishly they are selling out the national sovereignty of this country?<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the careful work of the Australian government's East Asia Analytical Unit in DFAT. Its publication on Korea is invaluable. It was given to me by the department, and I took it with me. I believe that there is also a number of other good publications. We need these publications because Korea is in a relationship with Australia that will stay; and we must understand not only China and Japan, but Korea, Indonesia and all the ASEAN countries in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Korean language initiatives within Australia are important. It is essential that there is a body of Australians with a knowledge of Korean. We need to extend the overseas student exchanges both ways between Korea and Australia, particularly at the postgraduate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to three areas: the ones I mentioned at the very outset. First of all there is the bilateral economic relationship. Thirty years ago this was negligible; now it is $US4.5 billion worth of trade each year. Korea is the third biggest market for Australian goods, and it is quite possible it will become second to Japan, supplanting the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic of Korea is very prosperous, and very soon it will equate with Australia in per capita GNP. The Koreans clearly have a very advanced economy and very advanced technologies. We need to continue to build a very complex, flexible and growing economic relationship at the bilateral level. Australia at the moment has a three to one advantage, in that our exports to Korea are three times greater than our imports from Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area is regional cooperation. I am now all the more convinced that Korea and Australia are honest brokers, independent and agreeable countries within APEC. Both of us want APEC to succeed to the fullest limit; and I believe that we can work together very carefully, not least in the coming summit in Jakarta. I believe that we can work together to strengthen open regionalism. It may be a little controversial, but I actually support the statement of the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) that Australia will not join the East Asia Economic Caucus even if we are invited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that not every parliamentarian has expressed that view. I support it for two reasons. I do not agree with Greg Sheridan's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the other day; that is a bit of journalese that is not convincing to me, particularly his references to the United States. I believe that we need to encourage Korea and Japan not to join the caucus. We need to encourage Indonesia, and the others who may join it, to the view that it should be basically an ASEAN discussion group without enormous consequence. We need in Australia to remain as an independent member of APEC. I believe Korea has that aspiration, and we should encourage Japan to adopt that position as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why I support the statement by the trade minister. Another is that Australia has a reputation for being fair dinkum; we are not just warm and friendly to every idea that comes along. I believe our credibility is increased if, occasionally when we mean no, we say `no'. I see no merit nor, in four years of discussion, has anyone on either side of parliament or government seen any particular merit in Australia being a part of that caucus. Whilst I wish the caucus well if its members choose to meet&mdash;and it is largely an ASEAN body&mdash;I believe that Australia, Korea and Japan should not be part of it. We can work together as independent members within the 18-member APEC community. We must see open regionalism; we want to see international competitiveness; we want to see freer trade in the whole region. That is the way Australia will prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is the most important. It relates to the Korean peninsula: the resolution of the nuclear issue in Pyongyang and the question of the reunification of the peninsula. I only have two minutes left at this stage of the day so I will speak about this more particularly on the adjournment. I will just give a couple of bottom lines. I believe that the way to resolve this matter is to focus the whole world, as it is largely focused at the moment, on the fact that the IAEA inspection must happen in Pyongyang and in other parts of North Korea. The best way to achieve that is by dialogue: dialogue that involves the Republic of Korea, the United States, China, all the members of the IAEA and all the members of the UN Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that North Korea is not meeting its actual commitments. It has signed the IAEA treaty to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities and it is not living up to it. The rest of the world, including Australia, must impress upon North Korea that it has to live up to the agreement it has made. Along with all nations in the world with nuclear facilities, it has to allow an international inspectorate to audit what is happening with the plutonium generated by nuclear facilities. There is a danger of nuclear brinkmanship. This could have a chain reaction and it must be avoided at all costs. The best way is to maximise dialogue on the basis of fact and on the basis of reason and not to be too quick or impatient to talk about sanctions which are in the quiver of the international community down the track. It might take many months. In two weeks time, there is a quite crucial juncture and we may see some resolution of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to unification, I will not be surprised if in two to five years time there is a unification of Korea. North Korea is near to economic collapse; it is not economically viable and it may well be united by dialogue with the south. </PARA>

We would not know that by reading the newspapers today or by listening to the television or the radio. Hidden away, more than 300 pages into the budget documents and not even mentioned in the incredibly dishonest speech that has been presented to this parliament about the budget, is the fact that total tax revenue is budgeted to rise in the coming year by a record $9.15 billion. This will lift total tax collections by the Keating government to the highest ever level of $103.3 billion.

We understand it all right. The word `law' to the government is clearly a dirty three-letter word, because here, in two years, we have had almost a 12 per cent real rise in tax revenues when there were going to be tax cuts. This year's 7.4 per cent real rise in tax revenues, after accounting for inflation, is not only double last year's rise of 3.9 per cent; it is the biggest tax rise since the 11.6 per cent real rise in tax revenues in Paul Keating's 1984-85 budget.

What is it that allows a government to go to an electorate and lie its way into office with promised tax cuts and then, when it does not deliver them, it is exonerated? It is not even mentioned in the media. Our shadow treasurer mentioned the 7.4 per cent real rise in tax revenues, but I have not seen it given any prominence whatsoever. Why are the media letting this lot off the hook? Why does the government not have to wear the consequences of its deception? That is why I am so angry. That is why I am talking when I should not be, when my voice is destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pretending that there are no new taxes in the present budget. The fact is that there are huge tax rises in the present budget resulting from, among other things, the tax hikes announced in the last budget but being implemented only in this budget. Let us have a look at some of these rises. The pay-as-you-earn tax that hits ordinary wage-earning Australians will go up in this budget by $3.6 billion, or 8.1 per cent. That is more than double the big rise that took place in last year's budget. That is not some sort of tax on business; that is a tax on ordinary Australians. It is a huge rise on top of last year's rise. But I say, `Don't worry, chaps and women; you were told there would not be a tax rise. In other words, you were lied to again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel taxes are going up by 12.6 per cent. Honourable senators should compare that with the opposition's undertaking to reduce the price of fuel in the last election. Taxes on superannuation funds go up by 27 per cent&mdash;it is not really worth while trying to look after oneself in one's retirement under this government&mdash;and sales taxes and excises are going up under this budget by a further 8.3 per cent on top of last year's 10.8 per cent. That makes a huge two-year increase of more than 20 per cent in sales tax and excise revenue&mdash;representing, in fact, Mr Keating's hidden alternative GST. We have got the GST that he said we must not have&mdash;that this government campaigned against. Here we have a huge 20 per cent increase in sales and excise taxes without any of the offsetting cuts in income taxes which had been promised in the coalition's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got the worst of all worlds under this government, with huge rises in income taxes and huge rises in indirect taxes. Yet when I came into the Parliament House today there was a group of television and radio interviewers at the front door and they asked me, `What will the opposition's tactics be, in view of the fact that there will be no tax rises in the current budget?' I must say at that stage I was sufficiently concerned about my voice to suggest they ask someone who could speak. I was close to speechless anyway, but hearing that question I became totally speechless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of nonsense that members of this press gallery are prepared to spread around. I cannot say they knew it to be false; they just did not know. They just had not read it, because they had not got as far as page 300 in the budget documents. I suppose I cannot blame them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a very important question of human rights. I raise it on the basis of the fact that the government is proposing to provide moneys through the UNFPA&mdash;the United Nations population fund&mdash;to the Indonesian BKKBN to train population program operatives for the Asia and South Pacific regions. To me, this is a very serious question indeed. It is one that the government as a whole should be very concerned about but apparently is not. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Mr Bilney, has an agreement with Indonesia. Moneys have been paid to the United Nations population fund which, itself, was involved in the management of the brutal Chinese population program which involves coerced abortions and sterilisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also involved&mdash;I have evidence for this statement, which I have presented previously to AIDAB&mdash;in coercive practices in Indonesia. Despite this, AIDAB has gone ahead and paid the UNFPA to get the BKKBN, Indonesia's national family planning coordinating board, to train up people in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific islands in their techniques of population control programs. I am very concerned about this, not only because it is a violation of human rights but also because of the deception practised in the Indonesian program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only as recently as 24 February, in this Parliament House, Dr Haryono Suyono, in the presence of Minister Bilney at the press conference where they published their agreement, when asked if it was true that the long acting hormonal contraceptive-abortifacient implant, Norplant, was being promoted as a beauty aid, failed to deny it. Not only did he fail to deny it; he compared promoting Norplant to promoting Coca-Cola, with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . like when you introduce Coca-Cola you introduce it not like a kind of drink but rather to put yourself there, everywhere and things like that. This is the way to inform people and to get them attracted to it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is deception, and we are paying for it. One of the statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) when I raised these matters&mdash;not only this matter but violation after violation of human rights and evidence therefor&mdash;was that he was quite prepared to subject the foundations of the government's population program to scrutiny. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of voluntarism is central to all of our population activities.</PARA>
<PARA>If that were truly the case, the keystone of the independent inquiry's report into population and development, which was commissioned by the government, would be just that&mdash;the issue of human rights. Let us see what that keystone was. The keystone was a contribution by Dr Karen Oppenheim Mason, who is currently a senior fellow at the East-West Centre in Honolulu and who is also engaged by the Rockefeller Foundation, which in turn has a long history of support for population programs throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 March 1994, when I raised a question in the Senate about Dr Oppenheim Mason, Senator Evans said:</PARA>

<PARA>What area? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of the key questions in terms of population issues and the aid support therefor is the question of coercion.</PARA>
<PARA>In the area of coercion, on her own admission, Dr Oppenheim Mason has stated that she has never written on human rights issues, and that becomes clear when one considers her contribution in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amazed that the government recruited an `expert' on human rights who has never written on the subject, who does not know what human rights are, who hardly believes they exist and who consistently shrinks from making any categorical condemnation of almost any government population related action on human rights grounds, no matter how heinous. Ultimately, the authority for the whole of that inquiry rests squarely on her report, and she has failed miserably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shallowness of Dr Mason's analysis is clearly demonstrated by her use of the old chestnut of cultural relativism in order to mitigate abuses of human rights overseas which would never be tolerated in Australia. Whatever our differences in languages, history, law or religion, we and our Asian neighbours are all&mdash;as members of the human family and indeed as members of the United Nations&mdash;committed to providing our citizens with a social order which secures the universal and effective recognition and observance of human rights. If we wish to forge closer ties with Asia and indeed with the island nations of the Pacific, it seems bizarre to argue that our neighbours are incapable of recognising cherished human freedoms or observing their international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example of the appalling humbug in Dr Karen Oppenheim Mason's report. Dr Mason's theme song is that the end justifies the means and persons are economic fodder. `Should incentives be used to encourage the poor to participate in the population control program?' her report asks. Her comment is brutal. Page 22 of her paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some observers regard state manipulation of the private costs of children in this manner as morally repugnant, others regard it as an appropriate policy tool no less ethical than farm subsidies designed to discourage the over-production of crops. Thus whether population programs should avoid the use of incentives on human rights grounds is a question that cannot be given any simple, abstract answer.</PARA>
<PARA>Do Australians regard their children as crops? Do parents in our neighbouring countries regard their children as crops?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shallowness of Dr Mason's analysis is again clearly demonstrated by her use of that theme of cultural relativism. That, of course, is a basis for violating human rights. On page 4, she says:</PARA>

United Nations conventions which document internationally recognised human rights use as their pole star this original declaration of 1948, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The rights contained therein are universal and inalienable. They have been ratified by nearly every government on the face of the globe.

One would have expected her to survey the literature for documented human rights abuses, at least in countries in which Australia funds population activities. Many of the other reports in the Inquiry supply detailed statistics in their field, but Dr Mason makes not the slightest effort to assess on a country by country basis the types of officially sanctioned pressures, the number of human rights abuses which occur as a result, the reliability of information about these abuses and the willingness of governments to change their policies. Such information <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">is</EMPHASIS> available and in great abundance. There is a growing body of work by Third World feminists analysing the operation of population control programs in developing countries. Dr Mason seems to have overlooked it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Cook is here today. My question relates to the gambling theme of the year's budget, as has clearly been demonstrated in this morning's press&mdash;headlines such as `A gamble on growth', `Jobs gamble', `Labor gambles on business' and `Willis' hope and pray budget'. I ask the minister: in terms of such a clear demonstration of gambling, will he tell the Senate on what possible basis the government is entitled to predict a dramatic and continuing upturn in business investment when the Treasurer's own department concedes that `while an increase in business investment in 1994-95 is certainly in prospect, the strength and timing of the pick up is uncertain'? If Treasury is so lacking in confidence in the government, why then should business have a different view?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="622" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason we are entitled to be confident about the growth estimates that have been made in the budget, and the investment among other estimates that lie behind those growth estimates, is that growth estimates of that order of magnitude were achieved in spades from 1983 to 1990 in a much less favourable overall economic environment than exists now for business. The inflation rate was much higher, as we all know, through the 1980s than it is now. The micro-economic reform agenda had not moved as far or as fast as it has by now, with the implications of that for business costs. The business taxation environment was much less attractive than it is now, with company tax now running at 33 per cent as compared with the 42 per cent that the opposition is keen on imposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of the 1980s a great many balance sheet problems had accumulated in a number of companies, as we all know, which had inhibited the investment environment for many of them, even though they might otherwise have been wanting to engage in investment activity. Against that particular background, in an environment where the average through the 1980s was of the order of 4 1/2 per cent and where that figure was exceeded, as I recall, in at least four years, for us to be predicting growth now of 4 1/2 per cent in this coming year, 4 1/4 per cent the year after, and four per cent and four per cent after that, in an environment where we have 4 per cent now, putting us at the top of the OECD league table&mdash;and a much more favourable environment than that which existed in the 1980s&mdash;is not to gamble on growth; it is to make a rational and fairly conservative prediction about what that growth is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly with the amount of business investment that is required: the business investment environment, the climate for confidence so far as that investment is concerned, has never been better. The conjunction of economic fundamentals in this country has never been better. The levels of consumer confidence that would justify that kind of expenditure have not been better for many, many years. The sorts of figures we are talking about&mdash;14 1/2 per cent for next year&mdash;were in fact met easily on several occasions during the 1980s. They will be even more easily met this year because it is off such a low base as a result of the dwindling business investment that has occurred over the last four or five years, as we are all too acutely aware. There is no element of gamble about this particular budget. It is moderate, it is cautious, it is sensible and it is responsible. I can understand perfectly well why those opposite are so unhappy about it: it is a budget which leaves them with absolutely nothing to say.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I think the minister missed the question. I asked why the Department of the Treasury was so lacking in confidence in the government's predictions. Did it have something to do with the prediction of increased inflation, did it have something to do with our record foreign debt, did it have something to do with the fact that the balance of payments deficit is expected to increase, or did it have something to do with the fact that an opportunity to further reduce the deficit was missed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasury understanding of the situation about investment is essentially as I have described it. It knows perfectly well, and has said perfectly clearly in a number of documents, that the climate is there for reasonable expectations. The precise amount of the investment and precisely when it will start to flow in the order of magnitude that we anticipate are, of course, uncertain. We have been realistically expecting for some time that that particular investment surge would follow, and everyone who has been commenting on this right across the entire spectrum of analysis has been making the point that the conditions are favourable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt people wanted to see what the outcome of this particular budget would be in terms of the extent to which we met our deficit reduction strategy targets. They no doubt wanted to see what we were going to do in terms of tax regimes and whether there would be new impositions on business or some other decisions making life a little bit more difficult for business. On the contrary, we have improved further the business taxation environment. We have created conditions where there are ample grounds for believing that the future will be as described in the Treasurer's budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the 1994-95 budget delivered in the parliament last night. Is the minister in a position to advise on the implications of the budget for the medium-term outlook for deficit reduction strategy? Is that strategy reinforced by the Treasurer's statement to the parliament? Is it integrally related to continuing economic growth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="624" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to outline that. Of course, the answers to the last two parts of Senator Loosley's question are `Yes' and `Yes'. The deficit in this budget will be further reduced, and will bring the budget close to balance in 1997-98. It will do it by encouraging maximum economic growth in the economy, by reducing unemployment, by promoting social justice and, more importantly than all those things perhaps for those on the other side of the parliament who are transfixed by these issues, it will do it without levying any new taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I should say that the deficit reduction strategy has been accelerated. In this budget the deficit is estimated to be $11.7 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP. That is $2.4 billion less than estimated in the last budget and a reduction of $1.9 billion on the estimate for the 1993-94 deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in this budget we have several new expenditure items. They address serious issues in the Australian community. They ensure that all Australians will be able to participate in the economic recovery. I have a list of them here. They range from $1.5 billion expenditure for the national land fund for Aboriginal land acquisition over 10 years and half a billion dollars over five years for Aboriginal health, right through to extra expenditure on mental health, extra expenditure on a national breast cancer program, further expenditure on medical research, $63 million over four years to assist homeless people in Australia, $48 million to fund an Asian languages program and, of course, some funds&mdash;$135 million in fact&mdash;over six years to help athletes prepare for the Sydney Olympic Games in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the expenditures have to be considered against the background that it was only last week that we brought down the white paper and committed expenditure for jobs and training and for industry policy and regional development initiatives. So taken altogether there is a large area of socially necessary outlays, but nonetheless the deficit comes down. As I say, it comes down without increasing the tax burden on Australians, so we keep our promise on that subject. The opposition has been running around Australia over the past several months saying, `There will be new taxes.' Well, there will not be new taxes, as the budget makes clear. The tax burden is not to be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outlays as a percentage of GDP will continue to fall. Outlays as a percentage of GDP will reduce from 26.9 per cent in 1992-93 and go through, on this budget's projections to 1997-98, to 24.2 per cent. The increases in the revenue side will be occasioned by a stronger growth in the economy, by higher business profitability, and not by what the opposition has been running around Australia saying on TV and radio over the last day, and that is by bracket creep. There is no high level of inflation in the economy. Wage earners will not be pushed into higher wage brackets in anything like the same way that would happen if there were a higher level of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra income is due to economic growth in the economy. Those opposite do not like to mouth the words `economic growth' because it does not suit them. They want to talk down the Australian economy, to undermine the confidence in the business community in the reachable goals of growth figures that we have projected, and to pretend, by relying on shonky estimates themselves, that that investment figure will not be realised. If those opposite look at the reasonable case that has just been made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, they would find that they have absolutely no support for their contentions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the increase in Commonwealth debts is a function of the high deficits that we have been living through in recent years as a result of the recession, as a result of the budget imbalances that flow from that&mdash;the higher unemployment payments and everything else. Tell us something new. That is absolutely no news at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth debt, however, needs to be brought back, and it will be brought back as a result of the deficit reduction strategy. That is what it is all about: getting back to one per cent or less of GDP by 1996-97. It is a deficit reduction strategy which has been applauded by the OECD and by other economic commentators right around the world as one of the most far-sighted, thoughtful and effective such strategies  that exist anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada is often cited as a model for comparison for this and other matters. By that period, after its particular deficit reduction strategy, Canadian fiscal deficits will still be running at the order of three per cent of GDP. We will be down under one per cent on the highly credible figures that those opposite have seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government's commitment to improving the level of health and related services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has been confirmed again in this year's budget, with the allocation of $500 million over the next five years. This continues the government's longstanding commitment to Aboriginal health which was established in 1990-91 with the national Aboriginal health strategy. The funding this year for that strategy, which is due to be completed in 1994, was $60 million for the community housing and infrastructure system and $10.9 million for Aboriginal medical services. That is what was in the forward estimates of the budget. On top of that, this budget actually includes $162 million for the expansion and enhancement of Aboriginal medical services and $338 million for the community housing and infrastructure program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clear evidence of this government's commitment to Aboriginal health. What is more, the national Aboriginal health strategy was set for review after its first five years. That review will happen this year, and it will highlight, for government, directions for future funding and appropriate new directions for services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows on this government's commitment to supporting the principle of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is a very important thing that they should have, and it is recognised that they should have a considerable say in the services provided for them. In fact, they will be making recommendations from the appropriate councils. As well as that, agreement between the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, will be the basis for continuing funding and focus for the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most honourable senators here would know&mdash;or perhaps they would not&mdash;that that program is divided into two sections. Part of that is funding for things like sanitation, housing and public utilities, and under the community health services there is funding for general practitioner services, women's health services, dental programs, and trachoma and eye health programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly looking at ways in which we can continue to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the government's commitment to improving that health program is quite clear. It is also quite clear, as the government has said, that we find the status of Aboriginal health totally unacceptable. In the light of Mr Fischer's comments, which I mentioned in this chamber last week&mdash;and I have seen no reference to Mr Fischer being chided, let alone spoken sternly to&mdash;it is quite clear that it would not be appropriate for the opposition to be looking after Aboriginal health because, according to those opposite, Aboriginal people could not be trusted with a tap. On the other hand, we have here a huge commitment of dollars, very significant dollars, for Aboriginal health. If those opposite want to argue this lack of commitment, I refer them to this answer and to this government's commitment in dollars for this program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health. It has three parts. Firstly, does the minister acknowledge that the money set aside in the federal budget last night for mental health, while of course welcome, is only $40 million a year compared with the $200 million a year recommended in the Burdekin report? Secondly, does the minister acknowledge that the public hospitals have been completely ignored, with no new funding for much needed capital works and no new technology acquisition money whatsoever? Finally, again on the issue of Aboriginal health, does the minister acknowledge that the problem is that there is only an extra $25 million per year to be spread over 98 Aboriginal medical services, that this will barely keep the doors open&mdash;indeed, barely maintain existing services&mdash;and that it will do little, if anything, to address the underlying problems facing the Aboriginal community and very little to improve the health status of Aboriginal people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept most of the premises in Senator Lees's question. First of all, it is very clear, if we look at the mental health allocations, that the 1994-95 budget provides $133.6 million&mdash;about $134 million&mdash;over four years for the national mental health strategy. That more than doubles the previous Commonwealth commitment in this area. Indeed, it is a very significant recognition and response to the wide-ranging and perturbing responses in the Burdekin report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very alert to the references in the Burdekin report, and that is why this extra money, almost doubling the previous allocation by the Commonwealth, is in this budget. That money will be going to improving access to mental health promotion and prevention, to better coordination of services and, in particular, to picking up the importance of education and any steps we can take to reduce the stigma attached to psychiatric illness, which is also a very significant part of the challenge of our community in mental health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not the only thing we are doing in the mental health area. I certainly think that some of these things may not be known to honourable senators. Some $22.8 million has been allocated to continue funding for the specialist vocational rehabilitation psychiatric units under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. We have allocated $12.3 million to expand and enhance the national action for dementia care, which is also a very significant part of this area. We have also seen the allocation of $12 million from the Commonwealth as part of the national prevention strategy against child abuse and neglect; and that was highlighted by Burdekin as one of the contributing factors to, if not one of the causal factors of, mental illness in people of an older age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are some of the areas that have got more allocations under this budget in the area of mental health. It is quite clear that this government had made a commitment to improving the mental health status of people and to recognising the importance of a Commonwealth-state project working together in this area. It cannot be something that only the states can be left to do. That has been clearly insufficient. It is a doubling of money from the Commonwealth's commitment, and I think it is very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees asked whether the allocation in the area of Aboriginal health is $25 million. This year it is $25 million extra, and that is only in the community services and health area. For Senator Lees to say that that would not make a difference seems to be a remarkable claim. I would have thought that $25 million per year on top of the money already allocated in that area is a very significant increase. The commitment is there; the improvement is there; and the targeting of those services has improved dramatically with that very significant allocation. It is not an allocation for one year, but an ongoing allocation of that money. So it is a bit mean, a bit negative, to suggest that this government's commitment to mental health and Aboriginal health is not in this budget; indeed it is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Jones for his question. At the outset let me say that, unlike that of the opposition, the Australian government's budget is both a social and economic document. Theirs would be purely an accounting one&mdash;we have seen more signs of that in the last 24 hours. We have delivered a budget which has at its core the principle of social justice for all Australians and an ongoing commitment to remove barriers that might still stand in the way of this objective. The government's commitment to the one in four Australians of non-English speaking background is evident not only in my own portfolio but also across other portfolios, most notably the landmark reforms in mental health. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to pay attention to migrants arriving in Australia as refugees or as humanitarian cases, having special needs as they settle into Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the initiatives are in the area of citizenship. One of the things that sets Australia apart from less successful multicultural societies is the fact that after only two years of permanent residence here, all migrants can take up Australian citizenship. There are an estimated one million people who are eligible to take up citizenship but who have not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget the government has allocated $3 1/4 million for 1992-95 and an extra $454,000 for each of the following three years to undertake a major promotional campaign. This, of course, complements my announcement in November last year that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration would conduct a wide-ranging review of Australian citizenship and the laws which govern it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of settlement assistance, it is important&mdash;and it has been recognised by this government that it is important&mdash;to give assistance to overcome settlement problems. Within my portfolio there will be an increased focus on non-English speaking background migrants and humanitarian entrants affected by unemployment and industry restructuring. Grants funding for migrant community services will increase by $2 million annually on an ongoing basis, taking a two-pronged approach: firstly, $1 1/4 million will be provided for new projects to facilitate access to training for job seekers in their communities; and, secondly, we are targeting people arriving under the humanitarian program, particularly newly arrived groups who have little or no community based support, and $750,000 has been made available to address the needs of such new refugee groups. As well as that, some $625,000 will be provided to strengthen the coordination and settlement services through the non-government sector and to improve the focus of such services on the particular needs of humanitarian entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased that, together with my colleague the Minister for Human Services Health, we paid particular attention in this budget to the mental health needs of people of non-English speaking background, particularly refugees and humanitarian cases. Many refugees have survived torture and trauma, and they are likely to have long-term health and psychological problems as a result. This budget provides $5.2 million to a program to help such people, with $0.9 million available in the next financial year. These funds to the national torture and trauma network will provide support and advocacy to help survivors use existing services.</PARA>

The government has decided to approve additional funding for the science agencies above the level of forward estimates, an additional cost of some $90 million over the next three years. It was the case, so far as the CSIRO was concerned, that there had been previously a one-off injection provided by the May 1989 science statement as a triennial injection for that particular period, and that has now been built into the base funding for the agencies for the next and future trienniums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a weird question coming from the opposition which has spent so much time belabouring the budget on the basis of the predictions for increased investment in the Australian economy. One of the things that the Treasurer has been constantly saying&mdash;maybe the opposition has not been listening; it has simply been chanting slogans and not taking in the information&mdash;is that we are on the verge of an uptake of investment in the Australian economy. Because of vacant office space in capital cities caused by an over-investment in office capacity in Australia, the round of investment that we saw coming through in last week's balance of payments figures, and anticipated to continue in forthcoming balance of payments, means investment in plant and equipment, investment in computing technology and investment, as we saw in the last balance of payments, in transport goods other than aeroplanes and passenger motor vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things are investments which do push the current account deficit out, and that is acknowledged in the budget.

Today I have released the joint government-industry task force report reviewing the administration of rural R&amp;D, an extremely important matter, to assist Australia's agricultural producers, and indeed processors, in tapping an extremely valuable and growing industry in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force report that I released this morning found that the model of an independent corporation managing industry and government contributions to rural research and development is performing extremely well. There is clear evidence that the model is making research and development more relevant to industry needs and facilitating increased involvement and investment by industry in research. Cabinet has now agreed to investigate options for a long-term strategy of continued government support, including funding of rural research. The impact of these arrangements on the competitiveness of the rural industry will be a key factor in this analysis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to add to the discussion as to why the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, was not present in the chamber today. It would appear that we were not given either a complete or a truthful explanation by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). My concern follows the fact that the minister misled us earlier in the week by saying that Senator Cook was on official business when he was clearly, as we found out, attending a Rotary breakfast. Today, Senator Evans said Senator McMullan was not here because he had to attend a meeting of the Cairns Group in Uruguay and that he had to catch the aircraft today to get there on time. I understand the meeting of the Cairns Group starts in eight days time. Senator McMullan has either taken the slowest aircraft imaginable to Latin America or a slow boat via China. In any event, it is about time this government showed a little respect for the parliament and that ministers fronted up to answer questions, as is their obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>

He is going to Latin America for a Cairns Group meeting. I had thought it was starting at the end of this week. It is, in fact, starting on 19 May.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to the budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked the minister to explain why, during a period of projected four per cent plus annual growth, the Commonwealth needed to run up such a massive increase in its mortgage and Australia's mortgage, and therefore gamble away the future not only of this generation but more particularly of our children and grandchildren. I pointed out the fact that Commonwealth debt in the four years alone from 1991 to 1995 has risen from about $30 billion to approaching $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few amazing things about Senator Evans's response to my question. The most amazing feature to me was that Senator Evans was totally unable to differentiate between a budget deficit and a Commonwealth debt. The two are fundamentally different. I must say that I am appalled that the Leader of the Government in this place is unable to distinguish between the two. Obviously, he has no idea about the massive debt burden which this government is running up, a debt which is mortgaging our national future and is part of the enormous and reckless gamble of Labor's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote again the increase in debt in the four years from 1991 to 1995. It is an increase of about $70 billion, rising from $30 billion to approximately $100 billion. That is due essentially&mdash;not entirely, but essentially&mdash;to the continuing budget deficits of this government. Over the last four years alone that budget deficit has been of the order of $50 billion, on top of which, on the government's own forecasts&mdash;even if its widely optimistic forecasts are achieved, which is unlikely in the extreme&mdash;the government will be racking up another $17 billion or so of budget deficit over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is actually doing is continually racking up a huge increase in debt, mortgaging the future of our children, and at the same time racking up huge increases in taxation. As we have heard today, the government had the gall to say that there was no increase in taxation in this budget. That is absolute nonsense. The tax increase in this budget is going to be $9 billion in this year alone. Individuals' income tax is going up by $4.1 billion. Company income tax is going up by almost $1 billion. Other income tax, which is basically capital gains tax and the like, is going up by a further $2 billion. Sales tax and customs and excise are going up by another $2 billion. There are other taxes, fees and fines which are also going up, by more than $100 million. So the increases are huge. It is simply unacceptable for the government to say that it is other than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing increase in the debt, of course, also means a continuing increase in the interest bill to be paid on that debt. In the five years to 1994-95, the public debt interest bill totalled $44.1 billion. That is almost as much as we spend in this country on defence. It is almost as much as this government spends on education. That bill is going to continue to rise and rise unless this government starts getting its act together, starts getting its finances together, and starts acting in a responsible economic manner. It is a huge impost that is being imposed on the nation and on our future generations. It is an impost, quite frankly, that this nation simply cannot afford. This year alone the public debt interest bill is going to go up by 29 per cent&mdash;a staggeringly massive figure. </PARA>

<PARA>The Senate will recall that the question was predicated on the assumption which the government has made that increased private investment will lead to the economic recovery&mdash;with increased productivity, increased economic growth and also increased employment. I was contrasting that with the lack of commitment which the government has shown in this budget, and, indeed, over some considerable time, in relation to investment in what might be called public infrastructure and, specifically, in what we might call intellectual infrastructure&mdash;the research efforts carried out by CSIRO, the universities and other research institutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could use the minister's own words, I wonder what planet he has been on if he has not been into the universities in recent years and spoken with professors and lecturers and seen the enormous pressures that they are under with increased teaching loads and decreased facilities for science teaching and science research, and the failure, therefore, of the universities to be able to adequately deliver properly trained people into the science area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder also if he has not looked at those figures which review the entry marks required of students going into science faculties. When we look at those figures we find that in the early 1980s the demands made of students going into science were indeed very high. We find now that the science faculties are having to take the absolute dregs of the student body in terms of academic ability, and that augurs very poorly indeed for science in Australia 15 to 20 years out. I really worry about what the state of science will be in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the specific figures in the budget, I believe that the minister was quite confusing and incorrect. If we look at appropriation No. 1, the recurrent expenditure for CSIRO, we find that the estimated appropriation and the actual expenditure for CSIRO in the 1993-94 year was $242 million. In the coming year it is anticipated to be $223 million. In fact, it has been cut down. Although we have a low inflation rate, if we take inflation into account, that represents a very significant decline. Indeed, if we look at the government's own analysis looking forward over several years we find in the government's statement that function outlays in 1994-95 are estimated to increase by $47.9 million or 4.7 per cent, that is, 2.4 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will pick up that item first. The government is projecting growth in the economy of over four per cent and yet its investment in this intellectual infrastructure on which the whole thing will be based, if it occurs, is only 2.4 per cent in real terms. Growth is growth in real terms, not growth without taking into account the inflation rate. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the forward years function outlays will increase by a further $45.5 million or 4.3 per cent or a 4.4 per cent decline in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA>So the government is looking forward over the years to 1997-98 to an actual decline of 4.4 per cent in real terms in the general and scientific research area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of my question still stands and I do not think it was adequately answered by Senator Evans, and that is: how can this government genuinely expect private investment to generate the economic growth and jobs it is forecasting if, in fact, the government itself does not show a solid commitment to the intellectual infrastructure on which in a modern economy that growth and that development is to be based?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has failed completely in this budget&mdash;indeed, it has failed consistently over a number of years not only in funding to university research institutes, including the CSIRO, but also in the direction in which it has tried to take science. It has ignored basic research, it has ignored the very important broad educational function which science has in our community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but we start from that premise. Unlimited funding for all of our own wish lists, of course, would be what we would support. The science community would obviously like more funding. I suspect that no matter how much any government provided to science funding&mdash;whether it is pure science or applied science, and whether it is through the universities or agencies like CSIRO, or the CRCs or tax concessions&mdash;there will still be a demand for more because the very nature of the beast in research and applied science means that the demand can always be made to be almost inexhaustible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While one is looking at the amount for science in these budget papers, one should also look at the initiatives of the government in last week's white paper. When they are all put together we find that there is a very strong case overall that government spending on science, R&amp;D has continued at a very good level indeed. For example, Senator Coulter did not mention that last week we announced a 150 per cent tax deduction for R&amp;D. Instead of cutting in at $50,000 per annum, the figure is now $20,000. Many small and medium size enterprises will now be able to claim the tax deduction which they were not able to get in the past because they could not reach the $50,000 minimum. That is a significant expenditure on R&amp;D. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the science agencies, CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS. Senator Evans pointed out very correctly today that the debate that took place was about how much of the special one-off, five-year funding that was granted in 1989 as a catch-up would continue for the agencies into the next triennium after the five years runs out on 1 July this year. The average of that funding over the past five years has been about $50 million spread across the five agencies. A component of that $50 million was a special component for infrastructure&mdash;buildings and equipment&mdash;to catch up on a backlog going back into the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government reduced the impact of the efficiency dividend on the agencies. It now only applies at a rate of one per cent on administrative areas of the agencies, not on research, and that is a significant improvement in the funding arrangements. I think it applies now, on average, to only about 30 per cent of the funding. Where it does apply it applies at only one per cent, which is a significant improvement. We did maintain that amount of the 1989 funding and it continues now into the base for the future trienniums, excluding the infrastructure&mdash;the buildings and equipment&mdash;because that was specifically a one-off. But all the rest of it, about $30 million a year out of the $50 million for the three agencies, is now written into their base as new money going into their triennium forever. That commitment was not made by this government or by anybody else before the start of this triennium. Therefore, it is a significant improvement in the funding for the science agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one puts that into the context of the commitment we gave at the last election to introduce another 10 CRCs at an average of about $50 million per annum for the next seven years&mdash;which also gives funding to science agencies as well as to universities and industry&mdash;one can see that this government has not backed away from the commitment to science and R&amp;D. It is a fact that CSIRO now has the ability to go out and raise commercial funds for R&amp;D, and it is doing it very successfully. It has already met the 30 per cent target. We would expect that it would be able to improve on that, and that is its aim over the next triennium. So when one is arguing at the fringe of maybe $1 million here or $1 million there, it is worth bearing in mind that CSIRO is already raising $200 million out of the private sector. I think that will be able to continue and expand. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Campbell this day, relating to the funding of the Australian National Audit Office.</PARA>
<PARA>When I first asked the Leader of the Government the question in relation to the resourcing of the Australian National Audit Office, he did not even know the answer. This is a man who came into this chamber on 3 March wanting to buy off the votes of those senators sitting on the cross-benches to stop a Senate select committee inquiry into one of the most disgraceful uses of Commonwealth taxpayers' money to buy votes at the last election&mdash;specifically, the sports rorts affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Fremantle by-election in particular this government was prepared to do and say anything to ensure that the Senate did not appoint a select committee to properly investigate the sports rorts affair. So Senator Evans came in here and announced what he called an accountability package. I said on that day that that package would unravel within a few weeks, and that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not at all surprised but I was most angry last night when I opened the budget papers, turned to the Department of Finance and saw that, under the Auditor-General's estimates for this forthcoming financial year, the in globo cut was $10 million. Senator Evans is the man who came in here and said, `I make this statement with these specific commitments in order to put beyond any doubt the government's willingness to act in all of these ways that I have stated to improve the quality of administration and accountability in this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, the Australian National Audit Office estimates were $53.945 million. This government in the estimates has slashed $10 million off that. In the federal budget $10 million can be seen as only a small part of the budget, but in the budget of the Australian National Audit Office it is 18.8 per cent of its annual estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After question time Senator Evans came into this chamber to add some additional information to the non-answer he gave me during question time itself. He said that there was a whole range of year on year fiddles and so forth, carryovers and changes due to the restructuring of the audit office that made my figure seem wrong. On page 15 of the program performance statements, it is all explained under the Australian National Audit Office. I will not go into the detail because I do not have the time available to me today. It is suffice to quote from the very bottom of page 15 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO believes that the financial audit business unit will face difficulties in completing the 1993-94 and 1994-95 financial statement audit programs with the funds that will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, specific representation in the program performance statement, the government's own budget papers, that the Auditor-General will not be able to complete what he has on his plate at the moment because of a funding shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator Evans has misled the Senate in saying that the effective funding base of the Auditor-General has not been affected by this $10 million slashing. Once I saw the budget papers last night I sought to do a close analysis of the year on year funding base available to the Australian National Audit Office, taking into account the carryover of administrative and salary costs that Senator Evans referred to and the estimated cost of voluntary redundancies. Taking those figures into account&mdash;$1.958 million for administrative and salary expenses and $5.9 million for the voluntary redundancies&mdash;the base funding available to the Auditor-General last financial year was $44.38 million and the base funding available this year is $36.68 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, taking into account Senator Evans's figures, taking all of those as read, the real effect for the base funding available to the Auditor-General to audit many of this crooked government's deals is a funding cut of $9 million&mdash;in excess of 15 per cent. That is after this minister came into this place and promised all senators that the government would get dinkum about accountability. A great start! Six or seven weeks after he makes that statement he comes in here and slashes funding for the Auditor-General by between 15 per cent and 18 per cent, depending on how one looks at the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this government is also, through the Australian Labor Party, stealing money from Australian taxpayers through the Centenary House deal&mdash;something which will now be investigated by a judicial inquiry, again, some seven months after that inquiry was announced.

As one of those who was directly involved in the discussions leading up to 3 March to ensure that the Auditor-General was provided not only with the resources but also with the independence and the further power to ensure complete accountability, I would indeed feel betrayed if this were found to be the case.

<PARA>During question time when Senator Reynolds rose to ask a question of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, I felt sure that Senator Reynolds, coming from Townsville as I do, would ask Senator Faulkner why Senator Richardson's promise of money in the budget for the Townsville aquarium had not been met. I know Senator Richardson promised money for Aboriginal health, and that proved to be false, but I thought that perhaps his promise of funding for the Townsville aquarium would have been met because it was such a determined promise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we did, and in fact issued a joint press release, I have to confess, because it is a matter of vital importance to Townsville. Senator Richardson promised it&mdash;he said it was in the bag, as he did with Aboriginal health funding&mdash;and, of course, there is absolutely no mention of it in the budget. I felt certain that my good friend Senator Reynolds would have been here to attack Senator Faulkner for not complying with that given promise. But no, she wanted to talk about the skyrail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to skyrail, Senator Faulkner is rapidly gaining a reputation as the minister for putting his foot in his mouth or the minister for dealing with bushfires that he creates. He has made quite a fool of himself in relation to this skyrail procedure, and I feel certain that he will do the same when he visits the aquarium. On Friday he will go to Townsville to talk to the aquarium people. I should warn Senator Faulkner, because I do not want any harm to befall him, that North Queensland people treat politicians who mislead them rather roughly. Everyone will remember how Senator Richardson was manhandled in Ravenshoe when he went there to destroy the jobs of so many people, and I can understand the anger of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also warn Senator Faulkner before he walks into Townsville and starts talking platitudes about the aquarium that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, promised to go up to the Coral Sea celebrations two years ago. At the last minute he ignored the invitations and just did not front up, even though the plaque had been engraved. I can assure Senator Faulkner that the people of Townsville were absolutely irate at Paul Keating over that. So if Senator Faulkner comes to Townsville on Friday trying to sweet talk the people of Townsville, he should remember what happened to Senator Richardson and Mr Keating when they came up to North Queensland to deceive and snub the people of North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The skyrail project, as Senator Faulkner probably now well knows, although he obviously did not at the time, has been over by more groups, committees and environmental people than practically any project ever in relation to world heritage or environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner hit the north, and I do not think he had seen or heard of the skyrail. But some of those on the green lunatic left fringe got on to Senator Faulkner&mdash;who is also from the lunatic left fringe, I suspect&mdash;and said, `You know, you can't let this go through.' That was notwithstanding that the Queensland Labor Government had been all through it, had approved it and thought it was not a bad proposal. Senator Faulkner blew into Mackay, was told he should say something about it, and said, `This is not going ahead until I am satisfied about it'. He made a big impact. He had quite a humorous interview with the press. He was asked about foxtail palms, a matter that the secretary to the Queensland premier is alleged to be trying to cover up. Senator Faulkner said, `Oh no, I can't answer that. My plane is waiting.' Of course, the plane that was waiting was the VIP plane, which would leave when he wanted it to. But that is another story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the information tabled by Senator Faulkner today clearly shows that all that information he was concerned about had been gone through by others. It is a very environmentally friendly project. I have explained this matter to the Senate previously, but unfortunately time does not allow me to do so again. Senator Faulkner has now caught up with the rest of the world. He has gone into damage control and says, `As everyone else has approved this months ago, I had better find some way of saying that I approve it.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the request of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) and pursuant to contingent notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion to take note of an answer to a question without notice for a period of five minutes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we suspend standing orders in this particular matter. I feel very strongly about the matter, as do all of us in the Liberal-National parties. Mr Deputy President, you might recall that when these matters of rearrangement of the Senate schedules were debated some time ago, we specifically looked at this question of allowing the opposition sufficient time to respond to the enormous opportunity government ministers were given&mdash;four minutes per question for all government ministers and then one minute for a supplementary&mdash;to get up to bag the opposition. It was understood for that reason that the opposition should have the opportunity to respond to those usually baseless claims by government ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis it was thought that there should be unlimited time for the opposition, and in fact that is the way we moved. Very rarely do motions to take note exceed half an hour. But should they do so as in today's instance, there was to be the opportunity for us to take the extra five minutes. In the debate the Labor Party and its left wing allies, the Greens&mdash;although I am not sure about the Greens; maybe they came across this time&mdash;but I am sure the far left in the Democrats voted with the government to restrict the opposition to 30 minutes. At the time they said, `Look, 30 minutes is plenty of time for the opposition. That gives the opportunity for six speakers to get up and have their say.' That was the principle, and the debate proceeded along that line. There were assurances from the government and assurances from left wing allies in the Democrats that that would be sufficient time. We pleaded with the Democrats: `Let us have an unlimited take note time.' History shows that rarely does it go past 30 minutes. We did all that because we wanted to avoid this sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have a situation where Senator Schacht has filibustered for five minutes of what I would class as our time. Senator Coulter, one of those oh-so-holy people who said, `You don't need 30 minutes', always gets the call. I do not blame you for that, Mr Deputy President, although I will speak to you about it later. He got the call ahead of Senator Campbell and myself, but he was part of the group which wanted to restrict our right to speak in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is typical of the Labor Party to try to restrict Liberal and National party senators when they wish to speak in this chamber. Everything that has happened in the name of Senate reform in recent times has been all about further restricting the speaking time of the Liberal and National parties. I know why the government has done it. In the other place it has run roughshod over everyone, but here in the Senate we are able to make points and they are telling. That is why our vote in the Senate is always so much better than that of the Labor party or the Democrats. The government knows this, and it wants to restrict us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht is filibustering and does so as often as he can. A couple of people on his side play the game properly, but he and a couple of others want to filibuster all the time to restrict the opposition. We are making the points, we are winning the arguments and we are getting on with it. Those opposite want to stop us. In this instance I think it is important for standing orders to be suspended so that Senator Crane is given the opportunity to speak for five minutes on a matter that I know is very important. I know it is a matter that the people of Australia will be very interested to listen to. For that reason I think it is important for the Senate to agree. </PARA>

We oppose Senator Macdonald's assertion that the provision in the standing orders to take note of question time is available only to opposition senators. That is an extraordinary proposition for him to make. When he rose on the point of order, he said that was the principle behind the change to the standing order to allow the taking note of answers at question time. He said it was a principle that existed for opposition senators only. In my seven years in the Senate, which may not be long enough to know all the ins and outs of standing orders, never before have I heard anyone assert that standing orders are written for only one section of the Senate.

We are the government; we answer the questions. It would be astonishing for the opposition to have a longer time to ask a question than we are allowed to answer it. That would be an astonishing principle to put. I assert that the standing orders are very clear. With today's example, they work very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the speeches taking note of answers given today were from the opposition. Senator Coulter was fully entitled to use the standing orders to get up to make his five-minute speech. I, as the minister representing the government here at that time, was fully entitled to respond to the number of points he made on that particular issue. Senator Harradine was fully entitled to speak for the three or four minutes he did on a similar issue that Senator Campbell raised. Are those opposite saying that an Independent senator cannot comment on the audit issue that Senator Campbell raised? That is a preposterous suggestion. We did not filibuster today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not filibuster. I answered the points made, which is what I thought, from the debate, that Senator Coulter was happy for me to do. So we as a government have not, as those opposite suggest, perverted the use of the standing orders, but it is a perversion now to say that ad infinitum the opposition can go on extending the half hour to take note of answers into the business of the Senate elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make this clear: what we did say is that if Senator Crane sought leave at the end of the tabling of documents, which do not number many today, to comment for five minutes the government would grant it for him to speak on something he apparently felt very strongly about, but would not extend the provision in the standing orders for half an hour at the end of question time to take note of answers when everybody had more than a fair chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in the chamber before when many senators on both sides have not been able to get up and move a motion to take note of an answer because time has run out. People have had to cop it. They have sat down and used either the adjournment debate or some other debate to make their point, or have probably waited two or three days to take note when they are given an opportunity after question time. I think the opposition's tactic is just to waste time and be destructive about the procedures in the Senate. We have made on offer to Senator Crane that after the tabling of documents he can speak for five minutes on the matter that he feels strongly about. At the moment we do not know what it is, but we are willing to give him that five minutes. Therefore, I ask the Senate to reject the suspension of standing orders as moved by Senator Macdonald. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague who has moved to suspend standing orders. I want to make one point absolutely clear at this point: if it had not been for the pig-headedness of the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) this matter would have been dealt with, as would the next matter and we would be on to the bill that Senator Tierney came in here to speak about. We are not trying to set a precedent today; this has been done before. We have asked for an extension for one particular point at a time when there is no matter of public importance and after the budget was brought down. Those are very significant circumstances. In Senator Schacht's typical manner, he has dug in his heels and thought that he would show his muscle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason there should be a suspension of standing orders is that the budget has just been brought down&mdash;a budget which is being described by every political commentator almost across the board as one of the great gambles ever taken in this country. A number of things have not been dealt with here today in terms of question time and taking note of answers, none less than the current account, which is the particular issue that I want to address for just five minutes. As I said before, I could have dealt with that and been done with it. I will take the opportunity when the time comes. But if the government is serious about having its budget analysed and scrutinised, it would not be frightened or running away, which is exactly what it is doing right now. It would have allowed that five minutes. We were not trying to abuse it and keep it going continuously; we were asking for just five minutes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of those people listening to this debate it is worth noting that, when we are dealing with the current account and its impact, one of the great fears in this community is high interest rates. We saw what this government did when it allowed the current account to run berserk during the 1980s and interest rates went up. We saw precisely what happened. That was very damaging. The government wants to know why businesses are not interested in going out and investing. It is because they are that damn scared of the government, its policies and its inability to control interest rates. In fact, we are now heading towards another huge interest rate hike. I think that needs addressing in this parliament and it needs to be brought to the attention of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht should have behaved sensibly and behaved as other ministers faced with a motion for an extension of time have done. It is not something that we on this side of the chamber have abused. In fact, I think it has been only once or twice&mdash;the deputy whip will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that we have sought an extension of time to address a particular issue arising out of question time. To say it is not appropriate to handle this issue at this particular time I believe is absolutely and totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the speech that I want to make has arisen from question time. It relates to taking note of answers and it should have been dealt with then at a sensible and suitable time. Of course the government does not like it that I wish to speak about the current account. One can see very easily why, politically, it would not want this raised and why it would wish to bury it as far down the day's agenda as it can. But the government is not going to escape its bad policies. It is not going to escape the fact that it has brought down a budget which has the potential, with the blow-out in the current account deficit, to keep interest rates increasing. We have seen, even in the last six months, an increase of one per cent in the 10-year bond rate. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that to put forward the reason for the need for this five minutes as being that Senator Coulter, as a Democrat, used five minutes of the allotted time is absolutely invalid.

One of the problems we had was that all of the senators who were at the beginning of the speakers list spoke for 10, 15 and 20 minutes, and many of us would have liked to have spoken for longer than that. As I remember, when Senator Chamarette spoke she could not get through what she wanted in 20 minutes and asked for an extension. Of course, the chamber graciously allowed her leave to do it. We have a very similar principle here. We now have tight restrictions on a number of the speaking times, including the speaking times on the adjournment, which I found out on Monday night, Mr Acting Deputy President, while you were in the chair, had been cut down to 10 minutes on Monday night as of 3 May.</PARA></TALK.START>

That way he would not have to wait in his office until after documents are dealt with and then rush back into the chamber to finish his speech. Why not have a little good faith and allow Senator Crane to get his speech out of the way so that we can then go on to the next business? That is all we are talking about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I want to raise comes out of the question that Senator Parer asked Senator Cook today, and it deals with the situation of our current account deficit and the fact that we are looking at a blow-out of $2 billion over last year's figures. I believe it will become the Achilles heel of this government in terms of the current budget because, without controlling the current account deficit, the pressure on interest rates grows to such an extent that it becomes absolutely uncontrollable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look back through what happened in the 1980s to see how that impact flowed through. When the Hawke government came into office in March 1983, we saw the current account deficit blow out very significantly from $7 billion to $18 billion and, at the same time, we saw interest rates range from around 12 per cent up to in the order of 15 per cent. That was a direct impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then towards the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, the government was using interest rates as its single manner of controlling monetary policy. That is what Senator Parer's question was about today. He asked: is the government going to use interest rates? Will it rule them out? What other mechanisms does it have to control the situation with the imbalance between imports and exports into this country? Of course, Senator Cook could not answer those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the current account deficit had blown out to $22 billion. Then in 1990 it dropped to $16 billion. In 1991-92 it dropped to $12 billion. In 1993 it was back to $15 billion. And, of course, this year it is estimated at somewhere around $16 billion, and likely to be at $18 billion or $18,000 million for this coming year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth tracking interest rates through this time because, as the current account goes up, interest rates go up in sympathy&mdash;although not in exactly the same way. As interest rates were coming down in the early 1990s, interest rates came back at the same time. As the markets read what has been happening over the last six months or so, with the anticipation of what was going on and the lack of courage of this government to be able to address the economic scenario in what I call an effective manner, the 10-year bond rate has increased from 6.8 per cent to 7.95 per cent. Already, in anticipation of what was coming, there has been an increase in interest rates of one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the government is prepared to allow business in this country to be able to compete with imports, we will have this scourge sitting on us all the time. That means that other than increasing taxes, as the government has done in this budget, albeit by decisions made last year&mdash;decisions that are flowing through now in such areas as sales tax, fuel excise, FBT exploitation, which is the only way I can describe the fringe benefits tax, and the impact in the states of payroll tax and such things as occupational superannuation&mdash;the only way it has of controlling the current account is by controlling interest rates. It is the weakness of this budget and the Achilles heel of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net flow-on effect as we go through the next two or three years, unless the government is prepared to address the things I have outlined here, will be that the pressure on interest rates will become so great that business will get the same hiding from the government that it got in the late 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Stevedoring Acts establish and provide arrangements for the collection of a general levy and a special levy. The general levy was used to fund industry employment arrangements and has ceased to apply. The special levy is used to repay loan obligations entered into to finance the stevedoring employers' contribution to the special "one off" early retirement/redundancy package made available under the waterfront reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Division 9 of Part VI of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (the Industrial Relations Act) provides for Port Conciliators and Port and Federal Coordinating Committees for the stevedoring industry. These arrangements were designed to support pre-reform industry employment. There are currently no Port Conciliators or Coordinating Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Waterfront reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The waterfront reform program was based on an In-Principle Agreement (IPA) negotiated between the Government, stevedoring employers, unions and the ACTU, and implemented over a three-year period from October 1989 to October 1992, under the auspices of the WIRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the reform of the industry framework, the IPA called for the restructuring of awards and agreements. A new award, the Stevedoring Industry Award, was ratified in November 1991. The award included a skills based classification structure which saw the former "waterside worker" classification replaced by that of "stevedoring employee", together with a wider definition of stevedoring operations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Stevedoring Industry Levies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision for a general levy in the Levy Act is to be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special levy will continue to be collected and applied to meet the industry's loan obligation until that obligation is met. On current estimates the loan is expected to be paid in full by late 1995. The amendments to the current legislation are not intended to change the application of the levy arrangements. In this regard and in the light of the cessation of the registration arrangements which had applied in the industry since 1977, the bill prescribes those stevedoring employees in respect of whom the levy will and will not be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (the Committee)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's primary role will be in relation to the special levy and the repayment of the existing loan. The Committee will also retain certain continuing obligations as the successor to the previous industry body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A revised structure of the Committee will reduce the number of members from nine to four, while retaining employer, union and departmental representation, together with an independent chairperson.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is currently required to maintain registers of waterside workers consistent with the General Agreement of 1977 between stevedoring employers and the union (now the Maritime Union of Australia). These provisions were part of  the industry-based employment arrangements which characterised the industry before the reform program. The provision for registers was also relevant to meeting Australia's obligations under ILO Convention No.137, the Dock Work Convention, 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the completion of the reform program, all parties agreed that the registration system incorporated in the General Agreement of 1977 would cease to apply. The bill will remove the existing requirement that the Committee maintain a register of waterside workers for the previous industry and levy collection purposes. The Committee will be required to establish a register of names of stevedoring employees, consistent with the Convention. The bill provides that the register can be constituted by prescribed records kept by stevedoring employers. For this purpose, the time and wages records which are required by the Industrial Relations Act to be kept will be prescribed. The industry parties will be consulted as to any other relevant records which should be prescribed. This approach will mean that employers will have no additional obligations beyond keeping relevant employment records up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sunset provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts sunset provisions in each of the Stevedoring Acts which will ensure that each Stevedoring Act ceases to have effect when the Committee's remaining functions have been discharged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Industrial Relations Act: Port Conciliators and Coordination Committees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the move to enterprise employment in the stevedoring industry, the Port Conciliators and Port and Federal Port Coordinating Committees serve no continuing function. Accordingly, Division 9 of Part VI of the Industrial Relations Act is to be repealed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with my colleagues, I wish to support the legislation and will later move an amendment. The bill amends the Student Assistance Act to create a proper legislative base for a number of Aboriginal assistance measures. The current Abstudy and assistance for isolated children schemes are under administrative guidelines. This legislation gives these a proper legislative base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For quite some time I have been aware of the existence of Abstudy and of the assistance for isolated children scheme, but I find it absolutely amazing that we have come this far in time without a proper legislative base. One would wonder what the department and the minister are doing to allow this situation to continue for so long. That is surprising when we consider the effect of the changes, which I will outline in a minute, and the fact that these sorts of facilities under the act have not been available until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation includes three other Aboriginal educational assistance schemes within the act, particularly for the recovery of overpayments. It also ensures that provisions relating to criminal offences are in the act and not in regulations. This is another aspect I find amazing&mdash;that aspects relating to criminal offences can be governed by regulations and do not come under the very close scrutiny of the parliament as a piece of legislation does, and that these for so long have been outside the purview of the act. The change the government has put forward to put these things on a proper legislative base is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing we should be drawing attention to, apart from getting the legislative base right, is perhaps getting the finance and programs right for this area of government activity. For quite some time the government has been putting an enormous amount of money into the improvement of the conditions of Aboriginals in this country. Given the amount of money that has been spent each year, I never cease to be amazed at how ineffective it seems to be in producing real results. Last year, I had the opportunity to join the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs in visiting a number of communities in northern New South Wales. In the areas of housing, health and education, as processes for improving the standard of living of people, we have not&mdash;from my observations on the ground in those three communities&mdash;come very far at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider the outcome of all this government action and expenditure over the years, we do not seem to have achieved a great deal. People in the Aboriginal communities are still in a considerable degree of poverty. The most heartbreaking aspect of the lot was probably the very high degree of unemployment in these areas&mdash;in particular, youth unemployment. In some communities this can get as high as 90 per cent of the population. One could well ask why, with the funds spent under the program of the act we are considering here, it is not far more effective than it could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislative change, in tightening up the provisions, will make the act function far more effectively. This, in particular, is needed because of the very sloppy way funding has been administered in this area over many years. To the credit of the department, and ATSIC in more recent years, this has been tightened up and improved, but there are still quite a number of glaring anomalies in the way funds have been administered in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago a scheme called TAP, an educational program for Aboriginals, had $80 million spent on it. The government assured us that this money had been spent properly, but the paperwork and acquittals were not in order. Our having been assured that the money had been spent quite properly, there was no way in any accounting sense that this could be proved. That brings me to the other worry about what is being proposed in this legislation. That is the reason my colleague Senator Teague will move an amendment to the legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. This amendment will be introduced by Senator Teague. It relates to the health care card fiasco, of which we became aware when we questioned DEET officials earlier this year. There was a scheme where Austudy applicants could have assets tests waived if they held health care cards. This seems to be a good idea which the opposition supports. Indeed, the government thought it was a good idea because it was part of the 1993 budget measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put it through the budget&mdash;and all the proper administrative arrangements were put in place&mdash;DEET issued a press release stating what it was going to do. We learned that people who had these health care cards would not have to have an assets test, and could therefore move through a lot more quickly into the program. It put out a guide for this&mdash;the Austudy guide. Application forms were printed and distributed, and a number of people with health care cards applied for this assistance for students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we had thought the  administration of DEET was slowly improving, it was surprising to see the way in which that department handled a change in this arrangement. In late December and early January it was discovered that this arrangement could be quite a costly measure, and that there could be quite a lot of people&mdash;a lot more than the government thought&mdash;coming on to the scheme in this way. So the government changed its mind. There is nothing wrong with governments changing their minds; they do it all the time. But it was the process which this government went through that was quite amazing. Having been on the estimates committee and having questioned officials, I found it incredibly difficult to get any sensible sort of answer out of the people involved in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DEET staff were informed in February that the assets test must apply to health care card holders. But the next process was quite astonishing in that no public statement was made that this change was going to take place. I repeat that no public statement was made. Here we have a government that brought in a change to an arrangement for students to apply for a particular benefit and, having decided to make that change, did not tell anyone about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In estimates we questioned the government on this. We asked, `Why didn't you let people know?' The answer was, `We didn't want to confuse people.' That is no way to run a government. The government should have been quite up-front about it, let people know, admitted its mistake, and then things would have been very clear. The problem came to light only when a lot of people started to go through the procedures that were set up and suddenly discovered that the rules had been changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In estimates when the government was further questioned on this matter, a number of very suspect figures were revealed. When asked how many people were affected, the government said that 100 health care card holders had been awarded Austudy at the cost of $300,000. This seemed to be a remarkably low figure. We found the next figure even more remarkable. The government said that only 20 people had missed out as a result of its reneging on the original arrangement. I found that amazing then, and I still do find it so. When we go back to estimates, I will be questioning the officials more completely on this matter. The government having made such a switch and an arrangement that affects a considerable number of people across the whole of Australia, it is very difficult to believe that the figures we have been provided with are correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidently what happened, and the reason the switch had taken place, was that the Department of Finance was worried that many more people would apply through the health care card arrangement and this would blow out DEET's budget. That department has a pretty big budget, and if the expenditure were $11 billion the expression `blow-out' would mean that a fair bit of money was involved. But the figures we have been given so far seem to indicate that not a lot of money is involved, and we will be pursuing this further later this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that proviso&mdash;and that is the reason why Senator  Teague is moving the amendment to the motion&mdash;we will be supporting the bill because, at long last, this arrangement will be put on a proper footing. Our amendment will ensure that the government honours its commitment to all health care card holders to waive the assets test for Austudy applications. This was the original intention in the last budget. The government should be held to account and should put this promise into place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief comments on the contributions made by senators in this debate. First of all, Senator Woodley criticised the complexity of the administration of the Department of Social Security. The government and the department recognise the importance of making social security as accessible as possible. The new plain English Social Security Act is a pioneering attempt to make complex legislation more accessible to lay people. Although it has its critics, the act has been welcomed by leading academics and welfare rights organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley also referred to the complexity of social security application forms. The department is re-engineering its existing practice with a view to having a common admission practice across all the department's programs. Senator Woodley also referred to a large volume of social security correspondence sent to the department's clients. The department recognises that there is concern on this matter and is currently reviewing this area. I suspect that only Australia Post would have a different view about the large number of letters being sent, but we do accept that there is  concern in this area and that it should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area is the issue of the health care card and the assets test, which has been raised in the debate. The government will not be able to accept that amendment, and we will debate it in committee. But I would say generally that some honourable senators in this debate got a bit excited and emotional on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already indicated in the Senate supplementary estimates hearing earlier this year that very few people&mdash;I think, around 100&mdash;got access to the new benefit because of the misinterpretation of information sent out. We have acknowledged that it was a mistake. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, has acknowledged that there was an administrative mistake and has put into place a review of all those procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that if the amendment moved by Senator Teague is carried, in view of the publicity now, the cost to the revenue would be quite substantial.

<PARA>These two amendments may be taken together. Amendment No. 1 refers to the commencing of the additional provision and amendment No. 2 is the additional provision. The second reading debate expressed the urgency of the committee agreeing to these amendments. I thank very much not only my colleagues Senator Tierney from New South Wales and Senator Boswell from Queensland, but also Senator Bell from the Australian Democrats. They have all agreed that the shameful reneging by the Labor government on its announcements concerning families suffering in the rural recession ought not to be quietly shuffled into some back corner, and the government should be required to face up to honouring its clear announcements in the way we have referred to during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Schacht has entered this debate at this stage for the first time, although he did say that he listened diligently to the clear speeches that were made here this morning. I will, therefore, be very brief in going over the point. It is the case that the government announced in the budget last August that any family holding a health care card&mdash;that is, a card available under the National Health Act&mdash;would not suffer the application of an assets test to determine eligibility for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural recession is biting many families who may have a large asset, their own farm, which ordinarily would produce a sufficiently high income so that they would not be eligible for an Austudy benefit for a son or daughter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the minister. This suffering falls not only on people living in the country but also even on people in the city who have businesses which, although sizeable assets, do not produce their normal income in the recession. There are tests for eligibility for a health card. If a family is eligible for a health card then let its children and all other family members be free of an assets test for Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that there would be less than 100 in all of Australia in the earlier months of this year who would have benefited from Austudy. But because of powerful speeches in the parliament about the matter and the double flip that this government has embarrassed the nation with, there will be such publicity that there might be 200 families now that would be alert to this eligibility for Austudy and, therefore, take steps to gain Austudy. The date from which this provision will operate is 1 January this year, which is the date announced by the government on which this provision would start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced it in the August budget. The Department of Employment, Education and Training re-announced it in a press release in September. It was included in the DEET budget guide. It was included in the Austudy guide&mdash;the brochure that students are to read to help them know what the benefits are under Austudy&mdash;and provided for in the Austudy application form for 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disgrace was that when the Austudy regulations were being put in place in December the government left this out and then claimed, when the flak hit the fan in February this year, that it was all a mistake. I regard it also as disgraceful that no minister made a clear statement to clarify the matter. There was not even a press release. There was certainly no statement to the parliament when it met in February. There was only a bullying piece of information given to the actual applicants from the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applicants, knowing that they are suffering in the bush or city&mdash;where, as Senator Schacht says, many are suffering&mdash;because of the malaise in various areas of the economy, read the application form and Austudy brochure, make the decision to go ahead with university study and apply. Senator Knowles, Senator Bell and Senator Coates all know that it is most inappropriate that it is only when those applicants get their applications in and they are being processed that they are told by an officer, `Oh, there has been a mistake. This wasn't intended. The assets test will apply to you.' Their hopes are dashed. They say, `But, look, this was clearly announced.' There was no clarifying statement by a minister or the government, only verbal messages to the applicants themselves and, as the minister said, perhaps there were 100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is well known, for years the Liberal and National parties have called for this kind of measure in Austudy during the rural recession, and has been calling for it for the last three or four years. It was not only a matter of successful motions in the Senate, it was also a clear promise, for example, in our policy speech. We have been consistent, and we have been consistent by adding these words to this bill so that the act can be amended. More precisely, the concession to parental assets test that we want is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining what benefit is payable under this Part, a parental assets test is not to be applied in the calculation of a student's living allowance if the parent is entitled to a Health Care Card issued by the Department of Social Security for the purposes of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Health Act 1953</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>With those words I will conclude. I will listen to the minister's response but I assure all of those sitting opposite that we will be consistent with all of our statements over recent years and months. We will persist with this request; we do expect this to be adopted here in the Senate; and we certainly urge the government in the other place to agree to the request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats welcome the amendments introduced by Senator Teague on behalf of the coalition. We recognise the work that has been done by various members of the coalition in reaching a conclusion and arriving at these amendments. The original announcement by the government should have been welcomed and implemented. Our position today is consistent with one we have held over a number of years. We believe that the assets of country families are more like tools of trade. They are not liquid assets generally and are not easily redeemable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard in the past in debates in this particular area that it is not usually possible, nor is it usually a recommended path to follow, that the back paddock be mortgaged to facilitate the trip of Johnny or Mary to university or to any other further studies. That argument has been put over a number of years. It has been difficult to arrive at a situation where an agreement has been reached. I well remember that on one of several occasions that I tried to introduce this reform on behalf of the Democrats I was admonished by former Senator Walters&mdash;I am rather glad she is not here at the moment because I fear such admonition would still be directed at me&mdash;who said that such a move would cause a blow-out and would be financially irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is strange that now the government rather than the coalition is proposing that as a defence. Nevertheless, I am very pleased to see this move because it is logical and consistent with our position. We need to look at this potential defence that such a move would bring a blow-out of expense to the department. This could never be a universal benefit because, as has been mentioned by Senator Teague, there are criteria that need to be satisfied. The first criterion is that a health care card must have been issued by the DSS to the parents; that is not an easy criterion to satisfy. Having met that condition, one finds that it is then further qualified by the need to be involved in an activity for which Austudy is payable. This reduces the potential group of people to whom this condition would apply to a very small number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already been told that, after the decision was announced in the previous budget, after the decision was published, after handwritten application forms were lodged and after pamphlets had been published, at the beginning of this year only some 100 were affected. If because of all of the extra publicity that this matter has received this time we double that figure, I do not think we would be overwhelmed by a blow-out. We should recognise that and dismiss any suggestion that the department will be crippled by meeting this great need, particularly from rural students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other students will qualify through this path for an easier payment of their rightful Austudy entitlements, but they will be few in number.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it a bit strange that last night, and again this morning, senior economic spokespeople for the opposition were attacking the government because the deficit was not reduced in a more substantial way; that we should have opted for a deficit for the coming financial year of less than $10 billion. The coalition might think, `What is $10 million in an $11.7 billion deficit?' When one keeps adding up those figures right across the board, as finance ministers previously in this chamber and elsewhere have said endlessly&mdash;I suppose former Senator Walsh was one of them&mdash;it all adds up. If a government keeps making concessions, then its fiscal structure just gets blown out. It may sound tough, and the argument,  `Well, what is $10 million?' may well have been used by ministers with finance ministers from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition cannot in the macro sense say, `We are hairier-chested than the government and want the deficit reduced in a more substantial way, more quickly,' and then say in this chamber on an individual bill, `Grant the concession; spend the money.' One cannot promise to increase expenditure, reduce taxes and balance the budget. From time to time oppositions in the history of Australian government have often fallen for that trick.

He was totally wrong when he said that the government never had any intention of honouring the commitment that it made four times through its budget decisions and then through circulars that it sent out to people who were trying to apply for Austudy.

<PARA>Clearly, if the government has any respect at all for Mr Free, then it must honour its commitment. Government members must close ranks around Mr Free and support the statement he made to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. That is apart from supporting the four prepared papers that were sent to a certain number of students; I do not know the exact number. Senator Schacht says 2,000 and Senator Bell says 400. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were students mainly from farm families whose parents receive zero or negative income because they have an asset that they cannot realise, similar to a tool of trade. Under the new white paper regime these 15- to 17-year-old children are not entitled to benefit from the scheme. These children have been brought home from school because their parents cannot afford to keep them at boarding school. They are ineligible to receive job training because of the asset of the family's farm. They are then ineligible to receive Austudy. These kids are the most discriminated against in Australia; their parents are on no income or zero income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht has told us he comes from a farming background, I would remind him that only nine per cent of wool properties are making a positive income, and therefore the rest are on negative incomes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two or three weeks ago a similar bill went through this chamber. I will not go into great detail on it, but it was somehow going to include the family home in the assets test. The committee voted against it and it went down to the lower house and was rejected. It came back here, and we sent it back again. Today, the government read the numbers and the government accepted amendment No. 8 to the social security bill. That was very helpful to the same people that this legislation is going to affect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to Senator Schacht; as a person who comes from a farm he would know the hardship that these people are going through at the moment.

The government is denying those young people an opportunity for education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what I understand the Labor Party professes to be all about. The government is supposed to give battlers a fair go. If the government walks away from these children and young adults it will violate every principle that the Labor Party stands for. Senator Schacht, Senator Sherry and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, ought to go to the cabinet meeting, bang the table and say, `This is the greatest embarrassment we have ever had. We promised these kids not once, not twice, not three times, but four times that they would get a chance to go to school and to university and we have reneged on it.' If those senators cannot convince the Prime Minister and the cabinet with those arguments, I do not believe they are trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is going to go through today. As I said, it will be the Labor Party versus the rest. It will go to the House of Representatives, and I am sure that Senator Schacht can convince the Prime Minister by saying, `This is a bit of an embarrassment. Let's not dump poor old Free. He has to live out there in the community and we have got to rally round our colleagues. Therefore, not only have we got to support the young adults and the children who are being excluded from the training program, but we are now giving them a double kick in the backside by excluding them from Austudy.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one argument that Senator Schacht put that I feel I have a duty to refute. It is only the semblance of an argument and it does not stand up to careful examination. I do this because Senator Schacht has not yet conceded that his good colleague in the other place, Mr Free, will immediately accept the request of the committee.

I grant that there is merit in the needs of these families for their sons and daughters to study at university. I grant all of that. I was even on a farm myself.' Senator Schacht mentioned emotion and sentiment and he also mentioned my point about justice. But he said, `This is the thin edge of the wedge. What about the Collins Street farmers and all the lawyers in town who will use this precedent to argue against the assets test being applied in all sorts of other areas?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the committee very clearly that there is a remedy built into this measure, and the remedy is this: as soon as the wool industry picks up; as soon as the rural recession is over; as soon as the pockets of recession that remain in the cities are no more, the incomes of these families will rise above the threshold, they will go back to normal and the income test alone will rule them out of eligibility for Austudy, or it will diminish the level of Austudy that would be applicable to those applicants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, listened carefully to the minister's responses and, like Senator Teague, I heard some attempt by the minister to present an argument. I distilled two lines of thought from the words that the minister used. One line of thought was predicated by the actual number who would be affected here, and the minister gave us an estimate of some 2,000 people. He gave us no qualifications for that estimate; he gave us no basis for that estimate&mdash;he said there were 2,000. Further, the minister expressed to the committee a fear that this would be a loophole, as Senator Teague has described it, and in some way dismissed as the thin edge of the wedge. I would like to address both those trains of thought that the minister shared with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the estimate goes, I suggest that as 100 applied after the scheme had been announced, written down, published and distributed in pamphlets, that is a fairly accurate indication of the number who would be affected&mdash;100 or so. Let us get this estimate right. The minister suggested that 2,000 people would be eligible. They may be eligible, but we did not hear from the minister what made them eligible. Perhaps the health care card was the primary qualification. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Schacht" NAMEID="4J4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I accept that that is the other indication of eligibility. The minister seems to have forgotten that the main reason people apply for Austudy is not that they are eligible but that they are ready and able&mdash;geographically, socially or according to their family arrangements&mdash;to attend a tertiary institution and, therefore, they apply. That means the number eligible would be considerably reduced. People do not just trot off to university because they have reached the age; they do not trot off to university because their parents' assets test qualifies them or because they have a health care card; they trot off because they have a purpose in mind. They go because other family circumstances at the time are suitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which affects whether those who are eligible in the minister's estimate will eventually participate in tertiary education and receive Austudy is the fact that in 1993 there was unmet demand in the form of something like 40,000 people who wanted to go to university but who could not do so because there were no quotas available. Just because someone is eligible does not mean that he or she actually gets there and receives Austudy. In the minister's estimate of eligibility, there is no guarantee that there was no double counting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know whether the minister's estimate of 2,000 people are people who would be attending and whether they will not actually replace those who are already in receipt of Austudy. Honourable senators should think about it. Just because we have these eligibility criteria established by the minister does not mean to say that that is the number of people and that is the cost that will eventually be borne by the department. If there were 2,000 people who fitted that category, I would suggest they could well displace several hundred already in receipt of Austudy anyway&mdash;that is, if they could actually gain admission to a university or to a tertiary institution. Last year some tens of thousands of people wanted to go but could not go because there were no places. So that 2,000 estimate, without any qualification, is really a very rubbery figure. I suggest that the most accurate figure is the number of people who actually applied, that is, 100 or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all the publicity and all the fuss and bother about this issue, when this amendment is passed&mdash;if the government wakes up to itself and follows Senator Boswell's suggestion, that is, if it convinces the lower house or those who are less enlightened that this is the right way to go&mdash;I would suggest that the more realistic number of people who will actually pass through all the hoops and be receiving Austudy will be closer to 100 than to 2,000. It might be 400, but it certainly will not be the full 2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to deal with the idea of the loopholes. At the moment eligibility for a health care card is determined according to a set of criteria. If there were as many smart alecs as the minister suggests, we would find all those people rearranging their affairs to make themselves eligible for a health care card. We have not seen that. Nor will we see a rearrangement of assets to qualify for Austudy payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague suggested that there would be an automatic disqualification as the economy improves. If last night's budget is as successful as the government would have us believe it could be, then that automatic disqualification will take effect quite rapidly. I am not convinced that it will but, if it does, that will be the safety net the minister should take note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my comment that, if there were so many smart alecs who wanted to rearrange their affairs to pick up a couple of hundred of dollars at the expense of the government, we would have tens of thousands of farmers rearranging their affairs to get the measly health care card.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or from St George's Terrace in Western Australia. Those who are not bona fide family farmers will find a way to rort to their advantage. I know that in the 1950s something that was always a bone of contention amongst the farmers in our community was that accountants and other professionals from Melbourne would buy farms purely to get the tax deduction that went with it and to hide their income accordingly, and they never came near their farms. That was always a resentment amongst the farmers in the community from which I came. So I have always been sympathetic to the view that we should not amend the tax arrangements that enable people who are not farmers to get an advantage. We have to be very careful about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I have moved those amendments together because they are consequential upon each other and have the effect of negating the government's attempt to increase the speed at which repayments are made under these student assistance arrangements. It has already been indicated that there is little chance of success for the Democrats in persisting with these amendments. In defiance of that, I have moved these amendments for the reasons outlined in my speech during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no justification for seeking to impose this extra speed of repayment upon students. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill stands on its own. There is no legislative nexus between the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and this bill. There is no logic that needs to be satisfied to bring these aspects of education funding together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immorality of the first reduction of the threshold, and the increase in repayment rates with regard to HECS, is not an immorality which should be repeated for the benefit of this particular package. I cannot, for the life of me, see why a government of the colour of this government should be seeking to rake off money from students who are in the circumstances of needing this sort of assistance. I cannot see why this government would want to get that money back any faster than under the previous repayment regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All it does is put the government in the position of obtaining the money a little faster. It brings no advantage in an educational sense. It brings no advantage to the students. In fact, it delivers to the students a situation where they are without adequate funds to begin their life after education. I believe that it is in breach of the understandings that were originally reached. We will persist. Therefore, I have moved the first nine amendments, which would have the effect of negating the government's attempts to speed up repayment. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make sure that these amendments are understood. The first list of amendments distributed under my name&mdash;some honourable senators may have a copy&mdash;contained 14 amendments. I subsequently amended that and distributed a list which contained only 11. It is the second list that I am referring to, and I am referring to those amendments numbered 10 and 11. I ask honourable senators to disregard any other lists that they might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of amendments Nos 10 and 11 is to delete the government's provisions contained in the Student Assistance Amendment Bill which would have had the effect of reversing the onus of proof, and presuming students to be guilty of all sorts of offences with regard to receiving overpayments or whatever, and requiring them to set about proving their innocence. This is contrary to the normal provisions of our system of government whereby we presume people to be innocent until proven guilty. This is also a marked departure from what we understand to be fair play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, I think this is a drastic case of overkill because the offences are likely to be in the order of a few dollars here and there, perhaps a couple of hundred in extreme cases; they are certainly not likely to be great crimes against humanity or things which will affect hundreds of other people. It is a particularly heavy sledgehammer which has been brought to bear upon this walnut, and we argue&mdash;I think successfully&mdash;that the government's proposition should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not alone in this. The scrutiny of bills committee was able to identify this, as it is able to identify many attempts to reverse the onus of proof. It found in this case that such an attempt was unjustified.

Senator Bell has clarified that those five earlier amendments have been replaced by the two now in front of us&mdash;in fact, old amendments 12 and 14. This greatly assists the whole process because the two amendments that are persisting are, in fact, directly related to the concerns of the scrutiny of bills committee. Accordingly, I will not have to oppose the ones that have been withdrawn. I will indicate that as the government and the Democrats are supporting these two amendments, but, more particularly, because they address the concerns of the scrutiny of bills committee, the opposition will also support them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have indicated that we will accept the amendments moved by Senator Bell. Our initial proposals in this bill were to recoup as much as possible of the overpayment that takes place because people do not indicate to the department that they are no longer eligible for payments because they have stopped their studies and so on, and there is no perfect system to make people tell the department exactly when they pull out of their studies and are no longer eligible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, there have been times in the past&mdash;I can recollect a few occasions&mdash;when the Liberal Party has transgressed in government about the rights of the individual. None of us is perfect in this area. We accept those amendments, but we have to concede that they reduce our capacity to recoup the $10 million to $12 million that is not being recouped at the moment. I am told by my advisers that, with the proposals now left in the bill, we may recoup only about $2 million of the $12 million, so we have to understand that the measures restrict us in recouping the taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of a Senate estimates committee&mdash;another full of atmosphere&mdash;may well criticise the department for being lax about not recouping all the money. So it cuts both ways. If we want to have protection of the individual&mdash;innocent until proven guilty, and all of those things which I overwhelmingly support&mdash;the downside is that we forgo getting back taxpayers' money that can obviously be better used elsewhere. There is always an argument in this parliament, and quite rightly in a democracy, about the balance between recouping the money, keeping the money accurate, and the rights of the individual. I suppose that as long as this place meets, the argument will always be a grey one, as we judge discretely the circumstances each time. The government accepts the amendments, but I want to place on record that by accepting them we estimate that taxpayers will lose more money than we would have anticipated, but that is the recommendation of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and we accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill was dealt with partially in committee earlier today and postponed until a later hour of the day so the coalition could get advice on some amendments of which, until that point, we were completely unaware. We made the point at the time that we were in favour of the principle of what was wanting to be achieved but we were not prepared to chance our arm and say that the amendments were probably okay. Many a mistake has been made that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have since had the opportunity to have some discussions. We cannot have them during the committee stage; we cannot duck out to talk to people who are in different places all over the building. The government has been discussing this matter with us in a different portfolio area, namely primary industry. As it was explained to me, the government discovered some particular technical impediment to proceeding through the primary industry legislation and decided to shift the amendments into law and justice. That was done at the last minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we understand to be happening, and what we asked to happen is that where RAS grants are made they cannot subsequently be sequestered by the trustee in bankruptcy when somebody goes bankrupt. Allowing that would mean taxpayers would be paying for the RAS grants to assist rural people to re-establish themselves, only to have that money suddenly taken by the trustee in bankruptcy to pay off creditors. That would just be a contribution to creditors, and that was not intended by this grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wanted to make sure that that would not happen. I am informed by the government that this matter was raised in the other place some time ago by Bill Taylor. The government said it would take it up&mdash;and it has. This move is widely supported. We understand that what has usually happened is that whenever the RAS scheme has been changed the Bankruptcy Act has been amended, but it did not happen in 1990 or 1992. That failure has now been spotted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As explained to me, the changes are such that all the people who would otherwise have had the benefit of this will get it. It has some retrospective application so those who may have lost out can seek compensation. I think the government believes that there are no cases afoot that will not fall into the appropriate net. I have no idea whether there are, but the best knowledge the government has is that that is the case. We are happy to support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other thing I want to add is a slight extension of what I said this morning. I think I understand how it is that we did not get advance knowledge of the amendments. They are not minor. The people who are about to have these grants taken by the trustee in bankruptcy understand the impact of this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change we could describe as being technical is the one we agreed to this morning in relation to the AAT which, in effect, covers the replacement for Deirdre O'Connor, the president of the tribunal, until she returns in five years, or when she dies&mdash;if she is run over by a bus or something else in the meantime. The presidency of the tribunal would then come up for grabs. The person who is going to get the job now, or perhaps has got it, is not there as a permanent appointment but for the duration of Deirdre O'Connor's exit from the job, other than a permanent one as I have mentioned. It could be said that that amendment is consequential on announcements made some time ago that Deirdre O'Connor was moving to the Industry Commission and Justice Mathews, I think it is, is going to the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not irrelevant amendments. As I understand it, they simply fell between departments. That is what was explained to me; that the AAT stuff was being dealt with by other ministers. Similarly, discussions on bankruptcy were going on in the primary industry area and everyone thought everyone was telling everyone else and nobody bothered&mdash;I am pretty sure that is the case&mdash;to say, `These are the law and justice amendments and they ought to go to the coalition person handling that.' Until this morning I had not seen them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turns out, all is well&mdash;due to the good sense of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) for postponing the debate to allow us to get this element looked at to make sure we were satisfied. But this is not the way to do things. Mistakes like that should not happen. I am very sorry that they did and am only pleased that we are able to resolve the matter amicably. People pay us a good deal of money and the civil service a decent amount of money, and they do not think that these sorts of amendments will be passed to someone that morning and a view sought on them without time to consider. In this case we have avoided that problem but the taxpayer is entitled to expect more of us&mdash;and we are entitled to expect more of ourselves. Anything else I might like to say on the time to consider legislation was said this morning. We support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found his advice very helpful indeed, minister. The problem arising here was very much an historical problem in terms of the Bankruptcy Act. For a long time we always had a situation where there was this artificial division between income and property. It meant that, for example, during the course of a bankruptcy, a bankrupt could have an income. But once that income was accrued and accumulated in a bank account and then property acquired, the trustee, the moment before discharge, would hit the bankrupt with a notice requiring the surrender of the after acquired property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the historical basis behind the problem which we have here. Certain moneys could be paid to farmers upon their leaving the land, either before or after the date of their sequestration orders. Those moneys were always intended to assist them in resettlement during the very painful process of leaving the land. But, of course, what happened was that the  money was then used to purchase a house or to put equity into a house, and the farmer would borrow the rest of the money from the bank. But the trustees saw this as an opportunity to claim that property because the initial payment itself may have been excluded, but the property which was acquired by virtue of the payment was at risk. This is what Senator Boswell pursued in the estimates committee. Senator Boswell deserves the thanks of the Senate for his very considerable efforts in ensuring a just outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things need to be said about the detail of the amendment. The amendment to section 116 by inserting paragraphs (mc) and (md) after paragraph (2)(mb) is a very good one. In particular, subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (md) picks up the problem of the property which has been acquired by virtue of the payment of the resettlement moneys. I am also very glad to see that the amendment to section 87&mdash;which has the effect, by virtue of subsection (2), of making the provisions applicable to any bankruptcy resulting from a creditors or debtors petition presented after 28 April 1994&mdash;has a lot of justice in it. That has the effect of meeting the minister's undertaking as to retrospectivity, which was contained in his 28 April press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only area which might raise some eyebrows is the new section 87 (3), which says that these amendments do not affect `any distribution of a dividend on or before the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent'. I understand this is intended to prevent the unravelling of distributions which may have been paid by the trustees in the unlikely circumstance where a person became a bankrupt by virtue of a petition presented on or after 28 April 1994 where the property had been realised and a divided had been paid by the trustee in bankruptcy before this bill received assent. It is highly unlikely that will be the case because the earliest at which a person could have been bankrupted&mdash;by my understanding&mdash;is probably 4 May, if the petition was presented on 28 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill receives reasonably speedy passage, I believe it is unlikely that any trustee will have had the opportunity to realise the property and make a distribution to creditors because of the timing provisions applicable under the act in terms of notice required to be given by a trustee in bankruptcy before the payment of a dividend. But the provision is a wise one because one can never be assured of the vicissitudes of passage of legislation in this place. Accordingly, I add my support to the amendment which the government has moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. I am rather sorry that it is coming on for debate just before we are due to move to government documents in five minutes or so. While the opposition does not oppose this piece of legislation&mdash;it is largely a nuts and bolts bill which should not, I think, take the Senate long to address in its particulars&mdash;it does give me an opportunity to address the human services and health programs in the budget which was brought down by the government this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether to be cross or sad about the budget in terms of health. I hear the debate going on between the Minister for Health, Carmen Lawrence, and the AMA as to whether the new funding for Aboriginal health this year is $17 million or $40 million. As far as I am concerned, it would not much matter whether it was $17 million as the AMA suggests or $40 million as the government claims. Whatever it is, it is mighty inadequate for such a massive and longstanding problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what we are seeing here in this budget in terms of its coverage of Aboriginal health, if one could call it coverage&mdash;it is not big enough to call it a fig leaf, I guess, in terms of its coverage&mdash;is really more an attempt by the Pharisees to walk by on the other side. I say that very advisedly. This Labor government decided that there was a lot of political pressure on and it had better do something about Aboriginal health funding. So what has it done? It has given us a marketing exercise that it is going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on Aboriginal health. When we look at the fine print, the government can only run up the flag for between $17 million and $40 million for this financial year. Two half cheers for the government for recognising the problem; about a quarter of a cheer for putting any money in at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of this past year there has been substantial underspending by this government in certain programs. This government had the capacity, if it had had the will and the commitment, to address some of that money which it knew was going to be underspent from early in the financial year. That money could have been redirected into Aboriginal health where there are urgent and crying needs for expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a practical example of what I mean that could make a massive difference to Aboriginal health outcomes. I have been to central Australia; I have visited Karpoo where Aboriginal people are trying to help themselves get on top of the grog problem. Those people came to Canberra. After Senator Richardson had made such a great fuss about a tap, they came here hoping that they were going to have a minister who would be understanding of their problems and need for support. They got themselves established by chook raffles to get an alcohol and drug abuse program running in central Australia. I give them full marks for that. But they did not have any Commonwealth government funding, and when they came to Canberra Senator Richardson, who was supposed to be their advocate, could not spare the time to see them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an isolated case because Daly River has  another indigenous people oriented and organised alcohol and drug abuse program which also cannot get the support of this federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to Cairns within the last month and I visited the Aboriginal coordinating council. People there are running the first national indigenous conference on alcohol and drug abuse. They cannot get support from this government for that conference to the extent that when I was there they were considering whether they would have to cancel. They are bringing experts in the field from overseas and around Australia. All these groups have leant a great deal on the experience of the Canadian Indians in programs that have proved to work. This government not only will not support them with money but also will not support them in time. That is why I say that those opposite are Pharisees walking by on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one federal Labor minister would attend that conference in Cairns, which is in about 10 days time, nor would one state Labor minister address that conference. So much for the Labor Party's apparent support for Aboriginal people. We all know that alcohol abuse has to be one of the most basic problems to be faced if we are going to achieve better health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>

So many health outcomes would be improved if alcohol abuse could be dealt with better. The people in the communities want to do something but they need help.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is an important document. It is also important for what it does not say. The document comprises 39 pages with a couple of pages of appendices. I compare it with a discussion paper on the same issue dated February 1994 which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Report of the National Inquiry into Human Rights of People with Mental Illness</EMPHASIS>. That was an interim report which comprised 29 pages. Somehow between February and now the government has found, cobbled and put together another 10 pages on the important issue of mental illness. Last year the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, handed down what was probably one of the most fundamentally important reports for this parliament to consider. It was a report comprising thousands of pages as a result of years of work that had reflected the views of many people concerned in the whole area of mental illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we compare the contents table of this report now tabled with that of the one in February, it is an almost identical cobbling and a repeat of it. All that has really been added are a few of the government budget tables that were presented in yesterday's budget and a few other nice phrases. Yet this is listed and considered to be incorporating the federal government's response to the report of the National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness. What a shocking, disgusting response on behalf of this government. Normally, when the government makes a response to an important report, it lists each of the recommendations and itemises against each and every one of the recommendations a government response&mdash;approved, not approved, varied, whatever. What have we got here? It is purely a cobbling together of a series of initiatives in a certain way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in answer to a question from Senator Harradine, Senator Crowley fumbled her way through a complete misdefinition between mental illness and dementia. It was very obvious that she did not understand either the question, the issue, the brief in front of her, or the table which set out the summary of new funding initiatives. It is very important to look at that summary of new funding initiatives to see what appears this year and in each of the subsequent financial years. It is going to be very interesting to test this government&mdash;like so many of its other important policy documents and statements&mdash;as to whether those funding initiatives actually ever eventuate or whether they get changed as a matter of broken promises in this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to be fundamentally very interested in talking to Brian Burdekin about how he sees this poor and inadequate response to what, on his part, was a very major paper. When the Burdekin report was tabled last year, the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, commissioned a coalition mental illness task force comprising Senator Jocelyn Newman, Senator Kay Patterson and me to undertake a Liberal and National parties' appraisal of that particular report. It was a very interesting exercise to go right through. We conducted very extensive discussions and consultations across the whole range of the disability groups and interest groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were certainly concerned to find the areas of great pressure on young Australians, particularly those with family breakdowns. We were also concerned to look at the associated issues of housing; the areas that impacted on women; the area of people living in rural and isolated parts of Australia; and certainly the impact of how it drew together those issues that affect general practitioners, specialists and allied health professionals. We were concerned to look at the issues of Aboriginal people; people from non-English speaking backgrounds; the lack of reliable, research-based information; and certainly the shortage of relevant statistics. It is no wonder that the government  has tabled an inadequate response of 39 pages when it has not addressed the fundamentals of each of those particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has cobbled together some budget initiatives in a particular way.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least two. I would like to mention them here. The first one is one that has been commented on by Aged Care in a press release and also in a press release in which the federal Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, welcomes the budget initiatives but notes that he has not been able to see any specific allocation for specially designed dementia facilities. That is also noted in the Aged Care report. I believe it is a very serious concern. In Western Australia, in particular, we have an extremely good, specially designed unit called Lefroy Hostel. It is a good illustration of the way in which humanity and compassion combine with expertise and extremely good patient care which, in the long run, is more appropriate from a value and moral sense, and also in terms of the effective way in which we look after an increasing number of elderly people who have been affected by ambulant dementia. Often the way they are dealt with is by being over-medicated and treated as prisoners because they endanger their own lives if they are in a nursing home close to a road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special facilities for people who are suffering from the effects of dementia are essential, and it is a very grave omission that there is not some allocation here for those purpose designed special units.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Patterson. I am sure it is one that many people want raised over and over again with the government at this budget time. Secondly, at a national level there are very few facilities for young people who are affected by mental illness. There is an acute need for acute care facilities. I think the absence of these facilities is going to be an ongoing problem in our community where unemployment remains a problem. If we look in our community, it is the remote and rural areas where youth are under stress in any case because of lack of facilities of every kind and lack of job opportunities. They have no help in the area of acute mental illness. We know that it is a vulnerable time and we know there is a problem with teenage suicides, so we have no excuse for not addressing this area of concern and doing it very urgently. They are just two areas, although I know there are many more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been made clear how this money is going to be used. I would urge the federal government to take on a strong role in making it clear that there are certain areas where states do need to expend funding to address problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a grave problem in many prisons. The open door policy in mental health often means that prisons become de facto acute care facilities and long-term detention centres for people who are actually suffering mental illness. The government should be examining whether funding is available for the training of people in mental health areas, the corrective services or police. There were two very tragic examples in Victoria recently where police, who cannot be expected to handle these difficult problems, shot people who were clearly suffering serious mental illness and offering very little threat to anybody but themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working together</EMPHASIS>. Like Senator Tambling, I too will be fascinated to see Mr Burdekin's response to this report. I think he will be absolutely outraged that all the work he put into his report has been treated in such a cursory way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 31 of the report that deals with older people is totally inadequate. Mr Burdekin's main findings on the elderly were that dementia should legally be considered as a mental illness; that many people in psycho-geriatric wards of public hospitals would be more appropriately placed in nursing homes; and that nursing homes should be avoided for placing people with psychiatric illnesses&mdash;not those suffering dementia but other psychiatric illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlighted concern about the design and adequacy of nursing homes for caring for people with dementia. The RCI classification for determining the level of dependency in nursing homes did not take into account mental disabilities or dementia. Residents' rights did not apply to state public nursing homes. Mr Burdekin expressed concern about the number of nursing home residents given night sedatives, and claimed that dementia-specific facilities are more humane and cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mention in this report of the current plight of dementia specific units and of the great need for more of those facilities. Mr Burdekin spoke at length about the importance of special dementia facilities. However, it seems that this government is absolutely opposed to the idea and wants no more of them. It is appalling that the calls from the industry and Mr Burdekin have fallen on deaf ears in the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Mr Burdekin's report claimed that family care breakdown is a primary cause of institutionalisation. There is nothing in this report to address that. Mr Burdekin also claimed that the tax system discriminated against people with dementia living at home and people with paid carers living at home. I cannot see that addressed anywhere in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Burdekin advocated an integrated and flexible approach to community care for people with dementia. I do not believe that has been addressed in the report. He also outlined a lack of community care resources in rural areas. There is a hint of that in this report with the increase in funding for Aboriginal facilities, but there is nothing in this report about the issues associated with aged people living in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Burdekin also pointed out the inadequacy and inflexibility of day care, and that issue has not been addressed in the report. He pointed out the need for in-home respite care for people with dementia. That has not been addressed here. He spoke about inadequate and poorly coordinated information for carers, and that has not been addressed either. He also mentioned the need for support for local brokerage officers for community care, and I do not believe that issue has been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Burdekin claimed that responsibility for the mentally ill elderly falls between departments and that aged services should be put under one budget. The government has not addressed that factor. As Senator Tambling said, normally the government goes through reports that are put before it giving reasons why it has not accepted the report's recommendations. I am not necessarily saying that all of Mr Burdekin's recommendations should have been accepted. However, we have no reason from the government for rejecting the recommendations. The government has just cobbled together a few things that it dragged out from the budget which had something to do with mental health and said, `There's our response to it.' I think Mr Burdekin will be staggered, and I hope that he takes the government to task, as we will continually, for failing to adequately address the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for my other portfolio responsibility of women, the same argument applies. One issue, for example, that I have just had time to pick out is that Mr Burdekin recommended the establishment of a specialist post-natal depression clinic. That does not appear in the report&mdash;it is nowhere to be seen. Obviously we are to forget that. He also said that there should be pilot early intervention programs, and there is scant reference to that. There is mention of only one of the four major areas in which Mr Burdekin would like to see the establishment of such pilot programs for women. Even then, the issue is just glossed over in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Burdekin report recommends that a pilot early intervention program should be undertaken to examine the links between violence, abuse and mental illness, the government has only committed itself to establishing a national group to raise awareness of the issue. That is not what Mr Burdekin was reporting. This report fails in respect of older people and also in having regard to the needs of women. From the point of the Australian community, the government has failed totally in its response to the very grave matters raised in the Burdekin report. </PARA>

It is an issue towards which the Federal national area has only just turned its attention, for the very simple reason that responsibility for the administration of mental health falls within state jurisdictions. Only in recent years have we been able to get the states to come together to consider a national policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is such that we must get our opposition colleagues to go back to their wonderful Liberal-National Party coalition state governments in Victoria, New South Wales and these sorts of places to get them to deal with some of the issues that they have not addressed and which they are changing. We have to be conscious that, for example, it is the New South Wales government that registers health care providers. The states have responsibility for the registration of psychiatrists, mental health nurses, psychiatric trained nurses and psychologists. And in some states we even have differing qualifications and requirements for the various health providers. This all has an impact upon the provision of mental health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before opposition members come in here and seek to criticise the federal government, they should start with the state governments because they are the ones that have the responsibility. It is the states which have the institutions and they are at various stages of deinstitutionalisation. The New South Wales government is closing institutions because 150 years ago when these institutions were sited at Rozelle and Gladesville, those areas were well away from where people were living. However, those institutions are situated on prime pieces of real estate on the Parramatta River. So what is happening? Without any great concern for the sorts of services provided for the mentally ill in New South Wales, the government there is closing down and selling off that real estate to obtain money to put into its coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today we heard about underspent budgets. Let us look at how much the New South Wales government and its health department have returned to consolidated revenue. Two years ago the figure was $52 million&mdash;$1 million a week of its health budget that it did not spend. Yet it can go out and sell off these institutions without offering a great deal in return for people with psychiatric and mental health needs in that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government has done nothing to attract psychiatrists, mental health nurses and psychologists to country areas. When I spoke to Mr Burdekin, he told me that a significant number of people with intellectual disabilities also have mental health problems. Yet in New South Wales the services for the intellectually disabled and the mentally ill are separated. I am not saying that is a bad thing. However, there has to be communication between those two groups of service providers so that those working with and helping those with intellectual disabilities can involve the mental health providers in the provision of those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for people to come in here and say, `The federal government is doing nothing. It is not spending enough money.' However, people should be aware that it is the states that have the prime responsibility for the provision of those services, and for the training and registration of the people who actually provide them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some areas the states have been deleterious in looking at that issue&mdash;very much so. If a Labor state has been deleterious we will have to take the blame for that. Certainly in New South Wales, the state with which I am most familiar, the Liberals have been in power for over six years and they have to wear all of these sorts of problems. Those opposite should not come in here bleating about how bad we have been. Senators opposite should go back to their state colleagues and tell them that they have to pull up their socks; they have to do something about training and they have to do something about the maldistribution of the professionals, the care providers and the service providers. They have to start to have some caring attitudes and some caring policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are not careful the states will totally abrogate their responsibilities and walk away from the delivery of mental health services and put it all onto the federal government&mdash;but not hand any money back, of course.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main area of concern is among those with non-English speaking backgrounds. Mr Burdekin raises some very special issues in connection with people with non-English backgrounds and mental health. I note that in the budget $3.6 million has been allocated to assist refugees and migrants who are the survivors of torture and trauma. That is a program that has been running for quite some time, and it is certainly one that I would not necessarily oppose in any form whatsoever. But how about the rest of them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many people are having difficulty obtaining government services. These people are having difficulty finding doctors who can communicate with them. When they are institutionalised, they are having extreme difficulty in a cultural sense, in a language sense and also, because of the lack of English, they are having difficulty with medical information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely nothing in this response that goes to the heart of addressing those very basic and fundamental problems that are being experienced by those with non-English backgrounds. There is a recommendation in the Burdekin report about the appropriate use of interpreters; that there should be standard procedure in hospitals and community mental health centres. This government would say there are, but there are not. There are many people being admitted to hospitals and being institutionalised who do not have access to interpreters. What has the government done about that? Absolutely nought!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation was that the composition of mental health review and guardianship bodies should reflect the multicultural nature of our society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the lunchtime debate I spoke about my recent visit to Korea. I made a number of observations and evaluations arising from that trip. I did not have time to address one area, the current nuclear question involving North Korea and the IAEA, so I will add these remarks to the speech I began during the lunchtime debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Korea has developed, using former USSR technology and some personnel for advice&mdash;and, in fact, using former USSR uranium&mdash;a nuclear power industry. In recent years this has been one of the most concerning aspects for all regional countries and for others in the Pacific, such as the United States and Australia. The danger is that, whilst this nuclear power plant has been producing electricity, the uranium fuel rods have been producing plutonium; and the plutonium can be diverted to make a nuclear bomb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If North Korea were to have a nuclear capability in its military arsenal, this would have a concatenating effect, a chain reaction, in other regional countries whereby they may take defensive responses and we could have a break-out in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. None of us want to see that. So the root of the problem is that we need to see an international audit inspection of the nuclear power facilities in North Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reactor near Pyongyang was closed down in late April. In the normal operation of nuclear power stations, the fuel rods would be replaced in the next couple of weeks. Accordingly, this month of May is a critical time during which North Korea may try to change the fuel rods. If it did so without proper international audit, the plutonium could be diverted. Then certainly all of the doubts with regard to the nuclear facility there will multiply. We are, then, at a critical point in that the nuclear problem with North Korea will be all the more on the agenda of regional countries and others throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Korea has signed the international agreement which requires the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to conduct regular inspections. At a meeting earlier this year of the IAEA in Vienna there was a unanimous council resolution that there be an urgent inspection of the nuclear facilities in North Korea. Australia chaired the IAEA when that resolution was adopted. I support the resolution, as, I believe, does every country in the world. I have not heard of one dissenter from the position that there should be this inspection. In fact, this is the issue: there need to be comprehensive and totally satisfactory international inspections by the authority, that is, the IAEA. But the question is: how do we make sure this happens?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also draw attention to the United Nations Security Council chairman's statement&mdash;I use the word `statement' advisedly&mdash;calling for negotiations and dialogue to achieve that outcome. There has not been a resolution of the United Nations Security Council, but the chairman made a well-informed statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my visit to Korea in the past month, I also visited China and had discussions on this issue, amongst many others. I believe that dialogue and negotiations are the way forward. Certainly there should be nothing attempted that could be interpreted as provocation, as this may lead to military action. It would be mindless and tragic in the first order if there were any military action by North Korea. The key words are `negotiations' and `dialogue'&mdash;even if it takes weeks and months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this critical issue of the rods being moved this month, which will require North Korea's direct response to international urgings for an audit. It is the view of the Republic of Korea that there should be negotiations. It is also the view of officials in senior positions with whom I spoke in China that there should be negotiations. It is a Chinese policy, China being a near neighbour and friend of North Korea, that North Korea should not have any nuclear capability, that it should not have any nuclear bombs. Living right on the spot, the Republic of South Korea wants to see patience and negotiations; it does not want to see any avoidable provocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the USA should also participate in this process of negotiation, dialogue and patience. Australia has a role to play in encouraging the United States not to be preoccupied with precedents such as Haiti or Libya and so take action into its own hands. It should not take precipitate actions, even US-imposed sanctions. Again and again in Seoul I heard concern expressed that the US might be less patient than other regional countries. There was anxiety about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see no possibility that the United Nations will impose sanctions, because China will veto them. There is no doubt about the Chinese position. China believes it can gain a satisfactory outcome&mdash;that is, full IAEA inspections&mdash;by negotiation, and it will not allow its neighbour and ally, North Korea, to be subjected to UN-imposed sanctions. Should sanctions be imposed by the United States and Japan, or by some small number of countries acting of their own accord, it would be a dangerous development. I believe that sanctions are so serious that we need to get maximum international support if they are to be acted upon by any one or two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that the salary remittances from Korean families working and living in Japan are very substantial for Korea, amounting to some $US600 million, as a low estimate, up to three times that amount, $US1,800 million. Should this money be blocked, it would have an enormous detrimental effect on the North Korean economy. It is already staggering, it is already hardly viable; and this would have a very serious impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Korea does have external trade, mostly with China. Perhaps 60 per cent to 80 per cent of its external trade is with China. If China did not participate in the sanctions, there would be that continuing avenue of international economic action. But the point to really grasp is that North Korea has a very small economy with very few economic relations with the rest of the world. Sanctions are an arrow in the quiver of those involved in negotiations, but I believe the emphasis must be on dialogue and negotiations. I certainly look forward to that leading to a satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not the time to expand upon my view that I believe that there will be unification of the two Koreas in the next two to five years because the north will collapse. I believe its economy is in its dying stages and that we will see an outcome which is the wish of the peoples on both sides of the border, and that is the unification of Korea. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take a few minutes of the Senate's time tonight to deal with a serious incident that occurred on Bougainville island a few days ago. This very sinister and disturbing incident has been raised by Mr Sinclair in the House of Representatives and by Senator Calvert in this chamber. I speak of the assault on Sir Paul Lapun and his family and the destruction of his home by people claimed to be associated with the Bougainville  Revolutionary Army. The assault apparently took place on the mistaken assumption that Sir Paul had been given a sum of 30,000 kina by the visiting parliamentary delegation&mdash;an assumption that was of course entirely misplaced and is entirely erroneous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did happen, as I think everyone in the delegation is only too well aware and the media travelling with the delegation made plain, is that Sir Paul took the time and made the effort to speak with us during our visit to the island about how the process of reconciliation might unfold, how the cycle of killing and payback could be broken and how circumstances could be taken in a better direction for the island of Bougainville and its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul is a most articulate and thoughtful individual. He is a most honourable man with a very proud record of service to his people on a number of issues that currently both Papua New Guinea and Australia are endeavouring to address. It is an absolute outrage that on the basis of Sir Paul having made contact with the Australian delegation he should be subject to this violent assault and his home should be destroyed. His family has suffered grievously as a result of his courage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this incident serves to underline the unacceptable and utterly intolerable face of the conflict on Bougainville and the violence that is directed against people endeavouring to pursue their lives peacefully. Sometimes it is random; too often it is deliberate; and always it is the innocent who suffer most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bougainville Revolutionary Army, our delegation was told, falls into three categories: the political grouping around Messrs Ona and Kauona, the cargo cultists, and a group loosely affiliated with the BRA who can only be termed criminals or gangsters. Part of the scourge of revolutionary developments in many parts of the world are teenagers with guns; to my mind, they are simply criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no solution to be found for the Bougainville crisis&mdash;which has now lasted six years too long&mdash;in violence and intimidation. Secession cannot be won by force of arms. The  conflict  cannot  be  ended  by  the PNGDF&mdash;the Papua New Guinea military&mdash;on the basis of firepower. That is recognised on the island and I believe recognised widely in Port Moresby as well. This latest incident, this vicious assault upon Sir Paul, serves only to underscore that reality. As Senator Teague said earlier in his remarks on the Korean Peninsula, the key words are really negotiation and dialogue. That is the only way to a settlement on Bougainville, as I believe our delegation's report, when it emerges in a couple of weeks time, will make only too clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A process of reconciliation on the island of Bougainville can flow successfully only on the basis of discussion, negotiation, concession, dialogue and in an intelligent approach to the vexed questions that beset the Bougainvillians, particularly that cycle of violence, killing and payback. These things are all too common and Sir Paul sought in a most reasoned way to address them in his discussions with our delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate: there was no money passed to Sir Paul or to anybody else on the island by the Australian delegation or anyone travelling with us. There was no consideration afforded to anyone who came forward to speak with us. There was no reward; there was no incentive; there was no inducement. All we were able to do in a responsible way, through AIDAB and through the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby, was to look at a number of potential projects which might be funded through the Australian assistance program to Papua New Guinea&mdash;in particular, for example, I draw attention to the Mamagota wharf, which is obviously a priority for the people living in the Kiunga area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say, as Senator Calvert made clear, that the Australian Senate&mdash;indeed, the Australian parliament&mdash;sends a message to Sir Paul and his family extending best wishes for an early recovery from his injuries and for the rebuilding of his home, and expresses also the earnest view that these criminals be brought to justice. Nothing could underline the need for a return to the rule of law on Bougainville than this kind of stupid, mindless, meaningless violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there needs to be a human rights commission for Papua New Guinea itself. We were told this by leading political and judicial figures in Port Moresby. There needs to be that vehicle to enable people to have access to a tribunal that deals with human rights abuses. But, in terms of the immediate problems on Bougainville, we need to see an early, quick return to the rule of law as security situations permit&mdash;a return to the role of the police and the judiciary and to the laws of Papua New Guinea being applied equally and without favour so that criminal incidents of this kind disappear from the lifestyle of Bougainville permanently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity of the adjournment debate to respond to some remarks made about me in the House of Representatives today by Mr Baldwin in an answer to a dorothy dixer he received in relation to the new parenting allowance. He referred to something called the `Minchin proposal' in relation to alternative ways of assisting families with children. Mr Baldwin took an example of a low income family on $300 a week, with two children under 13 years and living in private rental accommodation. He said that, under the government's new proposals, such a family would get $207 a week in family payments, rent assistance and parenting allowance and the Minchin proposal would involve a cut to that family of over $120 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a complete and utter misrepresentation of what I have been proposing and really is a case of comparing apples with pears, which of course this government does very often to its great discredit. I would like to take the opportunity just to put the lie to what Mr Baldwin has said today in trying to denigrate our attempts to bring fairness and equity to the government's programs. What I have been suggesting is that the government has an extraordinary mishmash of policies to assist families with children which the customers out there&mdash;the taxpayers&mdash;simply do not understand. One way of solving this problem is to come up with some sort of universal payment that everybody understands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give some definition and dimension to what I am proposing, I have pointed out that the government in 1995-96, which is the next financial year when all these schemes come into effect, will be paying out over $12,500 billion on assistance to families with children. There happen to be approximately four million children under the age of 16 in Australia, so it does not take long to work out that, if we divide all of that payment, the $12,500 billion, by four million, we come up with an average&mdash;I stress average&mdash;of over $3,000 per child. If we take Mr Baldwin's example, we come, therefore, to a figure of $6,000 per annum for a family with two children, which works out a $115 a week. If we add the mention that he has made of rent assistance&mdash;that is $37 a week&mdash;we happen to come up with a figure of $152 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is without taking account of the parenting allowance which he has just brought in and which, in the example he has given, is worth $54 a week extra. If we take the $54 from the $207 by which he said they would be better off, we come up with $153 a week that they would currently get from the government. Under my scheme, which I stress is based only on an average, they would get $152. So where are we at? The $120 that Mr Baldwin referred to has suddenly disappeared completely. This is what I mean by the government taking advantage of a comparison of apples and pears to come up with a figure that suits itself and which is totally fallacious and without any foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed is that the government has belatedly recognised the difficulty that it has got itself into on the issue of choice, fairness and equity in relation to those mothers who wish to stay at home and care for their children, and our demand that they be given a fair and equal opportunity to do that. The government has belatedly recognised the level of support in the community for that sort of option and that sort of choice. It has brought in this parenting allowance which, in the example he gives&mdash;a family on $300 a week&mdash;will be worth an extra $54 a week for that family. But this new parenting allowance must really be seen in the context of it replacing the married couple unemployment benefit which used to be worth&mdash;or still is, until this takes effect, which is 14 months away&mdash;$260 a week to a married couple. So from now on, $132 a week will be paid to each of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, what the government is doing in bringing in the parenting allowance is a thimble and pea trick. It is taking it from unemployment benefits. In the case of unemployed couples, where a married couple used to get the married couple benefit, one will get the unemployment benefit of $132 a week and the other will get a parenting allowance. So it is really just changing the names of the benefits. Therefore, we are really dealing with quite different propositions and we are introducing a whole new element into this equation which did not exist when I first started talking about my proposition in relation to a universal benefit which would provide fairness, equity and choice to all families with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of developing my proposition and allowing it to take account of the government's new parenting allowance, the equation does change. Of course, there would be further funds available to assist low income families, particularly. I stress that the example of a universal benefit is only taken on the basis of an average. It should take some account of low income families, as the government is belatedly doing with its parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly want to see any change to these arrangements having some bias towards low income families so that, having taken account of the parenting allowance, any change would not adversely affect a family on $300 a week. The family typified by Mr Baldwin would not be adversely affected, as I have demonstrated, in the absence of the government's new $54 a week benefit. When that comes into operation, I certainly would want to ensure that any universal benefit did not disadvantage the family that he refers to. I am sure that could be done without any difficulty and without increasing federal government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Baldwin and others continue to ignore the discrimination that this government practises against mothers, depending on the nature of the care they seek for their children. The government's schemes still continue to discriminate adversely against a mother who sacrifices an income to stay at home to care for her children. Nothing that this government has done takes away from that discrimination or ends that discrimination, except in the case of very low income families. The poorest five per cent of Australian families with children are the only ones who benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A family on average earnings where the mother chooses to stay home to care for her children is still worse off than a family where the mother goes into the paid work force and puts her children in child care. That is completely and utterly unfair. The government should be neutral on this issue as to what form of care the mother chooses for her children and ensure that the mother is paid a benefit that is equal in each case and is not discriminatory against the mother who sacrifices an income to care for her children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this adjournment debate, all I have sought to do is put the lie to what Mr Baldwin said when he referred to the `Minchin proposal'. He has completely distorted what I have proposed. He fails to take account of the change that is brought about by the parenting allowance being brought in in lieu of the married couple unemployment benefit. This, of course, changes the whole ball game but does not detract from the view I have put that the only way to achieve equity is to bring in a universal benefit. </PARA>
