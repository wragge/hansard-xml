<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to promoting and developing Australia's reputation as an attractive and reliable place to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reputation suffered a severe setback in late 1980s when too many people lost money in circumstances that could have been avoided by timely and adequate disclosure of relevant information to investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has worked hard to restore that reputation. The establishment on January 1, 1991, of the national scheme, based on the Corporations Law and administered by the Australian Securities Commission, was an enormous achievement. The co-operation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories behind that historic agreement was founded on a common desire to repair the damage of that period and raise a new regulatory umbrella, tailored to the real needs of investors in the internationalised, competitive Australian market of the 1990s and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other notable reforms have included changes to the accounting requirements, strengthening the law on insider trading, and improving the procedures for the settlement of Stock Exchange transactions. More recently, extensive reforms have been made to the corporate insolvency provisions and to the law on loans to directors and related companies. These reforms have contributed to the improved legal framework we now have. However, in my view the most significant change has been the establishment of a single well-resourced regulator&mdash;the ASC&mdash;which can take prompt and strong action to counter corporate wrongdoing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With equities again enjoying strong growth and attracting many investors into the market for the first time, this bill is an important and timely advance in ensuring a well-informed market. It makes major changes to the Corporations Law designed to enhance disclosure of relevant information for investors. For entities which are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, it will significantly bolster the continuous disclosure requirements already in place under the rules of the Exchange. Unlisted entities in which members of the public invest will have a new statutory requirement to disclose material information to the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New periodic reporting requirements, in particular, half-year reports, will also enhance disclosure by entities of interest to investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also reforms the prospectus provisions to facilitate fundraising, especially for listed entities and continuous fundraisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">History of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present bill is a revised bill, originally introduced in the Senate in November 1992 as the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No.2) 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will elaborate shortly on the major differences between the two bills. However, it should be emphasised that the central aim of this bill remains the same. Timely disclosure of relevant information is essential for investors to have confidence in the integrity of the market place and to make informed investment decisions. This must be the central feature of an efficient and fair securities market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Full disclosure of information about the financial position and prospects of entities in which Australians invest helps to counter insider trading, the creation of false markets and the distortion of markets through rumours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the capacity of a market to attract investment&mdash;and thus to enable continued economic growth&mdash;is directly linked to the confidence generated through timely disclosure of material information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 bill was prepared in light of a report, in September 1991, from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee on an Enhanced Statutory Disclosure System. This report pointed to the need for improved disclosure and recommended the introduction of a statutory system for continuous disclosure to the ASC by a wide range of corporations and other investment entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my introductory remarks, inadequate disclosure of material information was a major problem during the 1980s. This has been widely acknowledged, not only by the Advisory Committee, but also by the report of November 1991 on Corporate Practices and the Rights of Shareholders of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which was prepared while I was the Chair of that Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, significant improvements in disclosure have been made by the Australian Stock Exchange and by corporations themselves since that time. However, past experience has pointed to a need to change the legal framework to improve the level of disclosure and increase investor protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One essential difference exists in the approach to disclosure in the bill now introduced from that of the 1992 bill. This bill builds on the existing framework for disclosure by listed entities to the Stock Exchange, rather than creating an overlapping system for disclosure of the same or similar information to the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach has been adopted in light of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. It also takes into account criticism of the 1992 bill from business and professional advisers. While the bill retains and reinforces the role of the Stock Exchange, it also strengthens the position of the ASC to take action to ensure compliance with continuous disclosure obligations. Most importantly, it retains the principle that civil remedies should be available in respect of breaches of disclosure obligations. As now formulated, the bill provides investors with a right to recover damages where loss is suffered as a result of the market being misled through an intentional, reckless or negligent failure to fulfil these obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been the subject of an intensive consultation process over more than two years. This consultation has occurred at all stages in the development and introduction of the 1992 bill and again in the revision of that bill. In addition to the discussion papers and draft legislation released for comment, my Department and I have held numerous discussions on the bill and the approach to be adopted. This input has been welcomed and will continue to be an essential part of the corporate law reform process. The views of business and professional users of the law are carefully considered and have played an important part in determining the content of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee was amongst the bodies consulted on the revised approach to continuous disclosure. The Committee has recently advised me that it supports the approach adopted in the bill, including that continuous disclosure for listed companies be regulated through the Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains major amendments to the prospectus provisions. The amendments are based in part on a report in March 1992 on Prospectus Law Reform by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. A number of the provisions included in the bill were contained in draft legislation released for public comment in January this year. These provisions, as well as a number of others, have been revised to make policy and drafting improvements in the light of comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Content of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline only briefly the most significant features of the bill. A more detailed outline of the bill is in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enhanced Disclosure</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the 1992 bill, the enhanced disclosure scheme will apply to listed and unlisted entities in which there is a significant investor interest. These entities are referred to as `disclosing entities'. In addition to listed entities, unlisted entities, primarily prescribed interest schemes and debenture issuers, will be covered if they issue a prospectus or engage in analogous activities to raise funds or trade in securities. The treatment of prescribed interest schemes is largely consistent with the relevant recommendations of the review of `Collective Investments' by the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which was tabled in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flexibility is provided to enable regulations or ASC class orders to alter the effect of the disclosure obligations under the Corporations Law where this is considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enhanced disclosure will be achieved as a result of new legislative requirements for periodic reporting and for continuous, or ongoing, reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major change in relation to periodic reporting is the introduction of statutory half-year reports. These reports will be similar to, but not as detailed as, the present annual financial statements. The Australian Accounting Standards Board will have power to set standards for half-year accounts. There will be a requirement for an auditor to review, but not audit, the half-year accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previously mentioned, the continuous disclosure obligations for listed entities will be based on the Stock Exchange requirements. Civil, and in limited cases criminal, sanctions will apply where inadequate disclosure would reasonably be expected to materially affect the price or value of the relevant securities. This criterion&mdash;which needs to be satisfied in addition to showing that a breach of the Listing Rules has occurred&mdash;will ensure that only serious breaches of the disclosure requirements are subject to direct legislative sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For unlisted entities, a statutory scheme analogous to that proposed for listed entities is appropriate to ensure that investors can be fully informed through continuous disclosure to the ASC. However, in many, if not most, cases these entities will already be subject to the supplementary prospectus requirements&mdash;and thus will not need to comply with the new obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the 1992 bill, no `carve-out' has been included for confidential material to be withheld from disclosure. This is consistent with the approach now adopted of leaving the content of disclosure to the Listing Rules. The Stock Exchange has recognised the need to re-examine the Listing Rules in light of the legislative backing in the bill. It proposes to consider, in particular, the adoption of an express confidentiality provision. Should it be necessary, such a provision could be made by Regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the approach now adopted for listed entities in relation to enhanced disclosure depends upon a vigorous and effective approach by the Stock Exchange to the enforcement of its disclosure rules. It also depends on close and effective cooperation between the Stock Exchange and the ASC. This cooperation is already apparent in a number of areas and will be further enhanced by the proposed conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding between the 2 regulatory bodies to provide for cooperation in the enforcement of obligations on listed companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that the new legislative framework and the enhanced role of these bodies can achieve the necessary enhancement in disclosure. However, the bill requires a review by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee after 18 months of the commencement of the continuous disclosure and related enforcement provisions. This review, to be completed within a further 6 months, will provide an important, early assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information released to the market by the ASX about listed entities will be given to the ASC and, together with information provided by listed entities, will be accessible through the ASC database.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant reforms will be made to the powers and immunities of the Stock Exchange to ensure that it can properly carry out its major role in securing prompt and full disclosure. As with the 1992 bill, the 1993 bill expressly confers qualified privilege on the Stock Exchange in carrying out its functions. New measures in this bill will remove the requirement for the Exchange to give an undertaking as to damages when it takes court action and enable the ASC to share confidential information with the Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further, very important new measure will require securities and futures exchanges to notify the ASC of serious breaches of the Corporations Law or of their rules. This will ensure that the ASC receives, as a matter of right, information necessary to enable it to take appropriate enforcement action.</PARA>

The 1992 budget allocated additional expenditure of $3.2m over the following 4 years. The funds were to cover upgrading of the ASC's computer system and ongoing administrative costs.

Most unlisted entities covered by the bill will already be subject to continuous disclosure through the supplementary prospectus provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will advantage all senators and put an end to what so many senators have complained about for so many years&mdash;that is, legislation by exhaustion. The government has been committed to reforming the processes of this chamber and adoption of these measures will in fact continue that process of procedural reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset of this debate I mention to honourable senators what some of those important reforms have been. We have moved to a system of three sittings per year. We have adopted the principle of introducing legislation in one session for passage the next. We have introduced a system of comprehensive briefings for senators on legislation and we have religiously circulated the forward legislative program. We have reformed the processes and procedures of the estimates committees. We have eliminated what has been&mdash;and I think the majority of senators would agree&mdash;the lengthy and unproductive committee of the whole stage debate on appropriation bills and we have established a supplementary round of estimates hearings based on written answers to questions and additional information provided by departments at the specific request of estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has saved something like 30 or 40 hours of chamber time which, I believe, has been put to more productive use. At the same time, I think it can be argued that this has actually improved the scrutiny of government operations by the estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reform that was trenchantly opposed by the opposition at the time I moved it as Manager of Government Business in the Senate but which again has proved to be a positive reform is the limitation on speeches at the second reading stages of 20 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee was charged with the task of reporting by 30 September last year on ways in which the days and hours of sitting of the Senate and the order of business can be arranged so that more time is available for legislation and other business and late night sittings are avoided. There is no doubt that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee achieve these important objectives, and they are objectives that I believe have been shared by senators on all sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be placed on the record that it was a response from the Australian Democrat senators, as a result of Senator Chamarette's proposal for a cut-off motion last year, that led to this reference going forward to the Procedure Committee. The government believed that these objectives were worthy of close examination and referred these matters to the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee worked in a creative and somewhat innovative way. In fact, it dealt with these matters by unanimous and formal resolution, establishing a subcommittee of three senators. Serving on that subcommittee were me; Senator Teague, an opposition senator; and Senator Bourne, the Australian Democrats' whip. That committee spent quite a number of hours&mdash;as I am sure those members of the subcommittee will tell this chamber&mdash;developing these proposals and responding to the wishes of senators expressed in party room meetings and to views expressed by Independent and minor party senators. We had quite a number of subcommittee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be stressed that the proposals we are debating today arise from a cross-party perspective. While many of these ideas, although not all of them, originated with the Australian Democrats, views were expressed right around the chamber and they were taken on board by the subcommittee. The subcommittee then reported to the Procedure Committee. The Procedure Committee includes the President of the Senate, the Deputy President of the Senate, the leaders of the government and the opposition or their representatives, the Democrat whip, and other senators. It endorsed the views of this subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the reference came from the Senate to the Procedure Committee, the Senate insisted that we have a consultative process. The Senate insisted that all parties, including minor parties and independents, be able to contribute to this debate. It was a process of genuine consultation and of genuine consensus. As a result, I hope that it will receive across-the-board support. In particular, it ought to receive the support of those on the opposition benches who habitually and ritualistically condemn the Senate's working practices. I hope that honourable senators who have done that will be just as vocal in their support for this motion and for these reforms because these reforms are aimed at addressing those matters which they have complained about so loudly for so long. This is a genuine attempt to find a solution to the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worth pointing out that the committee's recommendations were drawn up in consultation with the Procedure Committee of the House of Representatives. It is very important, obviously, that we see the Senate and the House of Representatives operating on a similar timetable. The government is currently considering its response to the Blewett committee report relating to the procedures of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion proposes sessional orders which will impose disciplines on all honourable senators from all parties. All parties in this proposal have to make some sacrifices; everyone has to make some sacrifices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This includes the government, which makes a very significant sacrifice in reducing the amount of  time for government business. But that was necessary in the interests of coming up with a workable compromise. I have some concerns that it might prove difficult to get the government's legislative program through in that somewhat reduced time available for government business. On the other side of the ledger, to balance that, there will be a greater predictability about the time that is available for government business and legislation. The changes that have been proposed will mean that legislation can be managed more effectively; it will enable us to do more in less time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key features of this motion are to establish a four-day sitting week from Monday to Thursday. There will be a 2.00 p.m. start on Mondays and Tuesdays, and a 9.30 a.m. start on Wednesdays and Thursdays. There will be a limit of 40 minutes on the adjournment debate, with the debate concluding, at the latest, at 8.00 p.m. on each sitting night. There will be a limit of one hour for debate on matters of public importance and urgency motions. The time for debate on committee reports will be confined to one hour on Wednesdays and one hour on Thursdays, as well as that usual period for debate on general business on Thursdays. I believe that is a more than adequate time for proper debate of committee reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will mean a quite radical difference to the way the Senate will operate. I believe that they will bring a greater degree of predictability to the proceedings of the Senate. They will ensure that adequate time is available for legislation from the beginning of each session, which will obviously significantly help to avoid the backlog of legislation that always seems to occur towards the end of a sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would know, the classic example of this occurred in the first three weeks of the last budget sittings of the Senate when the Senate spent only five hours on legislation in three weeks. If these recommendations are adopted, this sort of situation cannot and will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the recommendations will also make a very significant contribution to the wellbeing of senators and all staff who are associated with the operation of the Senate. I do think it is particularly fitting in the Year of the Family that the recommendations will allow many staff and senators to have something approaching a more normal family life during sitting periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this proposal will be enthusiastically embraced by Senator Herron, who so often has stood up in this chamber and expressed concerns about the stress that is placed on the health and the wellbeing of senators and staff by sitting late hours. I appreciate the spirit in which he has made those comments. I have said to Senator Herron privately, and also on the floor of the chamber&mdash;</PARA>

I hope the spirit of those efforts is accepted by honourable senators all around the chamber. I think, however, any reasonable and rational senator would know that the time has come for us to institutionalise more sensible and reasonable sitting hours and sitting times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that these procedures are really put to the test, the government is proposing, as was recommended by the Procedure Committee, that they operate only as a sessional order. I think there will be adequate capacity in the remainder of this session and throughout the year as it unfolds for a realistic assessment to be made of the effectiveness of this new regime that I hope will be adopted today by the Senate. All parties and all honourable senators will have a capacity to make an informed judgment about these sessional orders before they become standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedural changes that are proposed by the Procedure Committee, which were unanimously adopted through that process by the members of the subcommittee&mdash;and I thank Senator Bourne and Senator Teague for their involvement and commitment to the task because I believe that that was very real&mdash;will really be a very significant reform indeed of the way the Senate operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These procedural changes do represent&mdash;as we will be told, I suspect quite often, by opposition senators&mdash;quite radical changes to the Senate's sitting pattern. They are real changes, but they are also commonsense proposals. They make a hell of a lot of good sense. They tackle problems which honourable senators from right around this chamber have addressed time and time again. They address concerns that have been expressed in the Senate by senators from parties of all political persuasions for literally decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms will make our lives as senators, and the lives of those people who work in this parliament, more pleasant. I believe they will make the work of honourable senators, the work of the Senate and the work of our parliament a great deal more productive than it is now. In fact, they are the sorts of workplace reforms that we all demand of the community outside Parliament House. I believe that these reforms are worthy of the support of all honourable senators.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have participated in, and contributed to, reform through the Procedure Committee and in other ways. As has been mentioned, Senator Herron has written to Senator Faulkner expressing his concerns about the health consequences of the ridiculously long hours that this chamber sits from time to time. Mention has been made of Senator Teague, who participated constructively in a subcommittee of the Procedure Committee on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that some concessions have been made to us in the proposal being put before the chamber today. One of those, I understand, is to allow time for normal party meetings on Tuesdays, which the government was proposing to remove. In other words, it was proposing to provide sitting times during that time and therefore remove from us the capacity to have a party meeting at that time. The party meeting would have been pushed off to another late night meeting, which has the same consequences of this Senate sitting late. So there have been a few concessions. I can think of only one, actually, but at least that one concession was made to us and is in the document before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, against that background it is also important to understand clearly the motive of the government in this matter. The motive of the government is to further restrict the capability of the Senate to meet its responsibility for full and proper scrutiny of the government's legislative program. That is what this government is about when it talks about reform. What it really means is to further restrict the capacity of the opposition to be effective in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the attitude of the government to the Australian Senate. We have heard it often from the lips of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He regards this place as unrepresentative swill, a nuisance to him in carrying out his responsibilities as leader of a government. He would see this chamber reduced to nothing more than a rubber stamp. Therefore, the further that the capacity of the chamber can be restricted, the better it is for him and his objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen his attitude to democracy demonstrated in the House of Representatives, where he is prepared simply to cancel question time when it does not suit him, and to remove the traditional rights of censure and the raising of matters of public importance. In other words, the Prime Minister has no respect at all for the functions of an alternative government to put pressure on, and to properly scrutinise, the government in both its legislative and financial functions. That is his attitude to the parliamentary process. To him it is nothing more than a nuisance. Therefore, the further the Senate can be restricted the better it is from his perspective. That is what this is all about. When one looks at the package before us, what stands out is all the examples in which the opposition is to be further restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, it is really only the Senate which has the capability now to put the government under any form of effective scrutiny. This has been precious to this chamber.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is as a result of that that the whole process of committees has been worked up. We have the legislative and general purpose committees to examine legislation. We have instituted short-term inquiries on Fridays so that there can be more effective scrutiny and we can bring the community into the legislative process and give it the opportunity to participate through the committees in order that the Senate be better informed in its debate. It is the reason why the estimates committees of this chamber have developed in a way that we can at least scrutinise in some detail the budget of the government, its financial intentions, and how it is expending the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost the principal role of this chamber as a house of review to scrutinise the government and to hold it accountable. Therefore, the more the chamber is restricted in that capability the more its effectiveness is reduced, and I think that would concern all thinking Australians. It is sad that that is the attitude of this government and that it is prepared, for the short-term benefit of reducing scrutiny of its program at the moment, to take from the Senate the capacities that it currently has to reasonably, effectively scrutinise government performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through some of the changes that are before us today. I think anyone looking at them will see that it is the opposition that is to lose rights and capabilities as a result of this package. I will start with the adjournment. It is proposed that adjournments&mdash;that are unlimited at the moment&mdash;be reduced to just 40 minutes. On average, I think we take less than 40 minutes a day on the adjournment, but there is a capability now, if there is an issue of great importance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like last night. If an issue requires considerable detailed revelation and exploration, there is a capability now for a longer period to be taken on the adjournment. Historically, that has happened on a number of occasions. It is not a right that is abused because, as I have said, on average it would seem that the Senate takes less than the 40 minutes. But it is a residual capacity that is there for the Senate to use when circumstances demand that it be used. That is to be lost by this so-called reform. We are to be limited to just 40 minutes with a deadline, no matter how important the issue may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that 40-minute period, individual speakers are to be limited to just 10 minutes each; so their opportunity to contribute will be reduced from 30 minutes, as it is now, to just 10 minutes. On some issues the point can be made in 10 minutes or less. On other issues, particularly issues of great detail, it is simply impossible to effectively communicate the message that an individual senator wants to put before the Senate in just 10 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why this matter needs to be so severely restricted. The average time taken by speakers in the adjournment debate is much less than 30 minutes. So there is no reason to reduce the time limit because that would reduce the capability of a speaker to effectively respond to a particular issue that requires a response greater than 10 minutes. Such a move would lead to a loss of rights of individual senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that argument, it does not take too much to realise that if senators from across the parties come in on the adjournment debate, only four will be able to speak within a 40-minute timetable at a maximum of 10 minutes per person. It will be easy, therefore, for the government to thwart effective debate on the adjournment because the opposition will be restricted to one or perhaps two speakers who in turn will be restricted to just 10 minutes maximum each. So today we are being asked to vote on an effective loss of capability to use the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also proposes reducing the daily capacity to debate government documents. The proposal is an allocation of two days, and then a period at the end of the day.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some matters that arise out of government documents are of critical importance and should be debated at the time that is current. By agreeing to this package, such a capacity will be lost. I agree that quite often a matter will be deferred to the following day or, if it is the Wednesday debate, deferred to the following week without much being lost; but in some cases it will not be. So that in-built, flexible capacity which we have at the moment to respond to what is important at the moment will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) dismissed allocation of debate on the committee reports as adequate time without understanding the enormous amount of work in producing sound, thoughtful, committee responses&mdash;months of work by senators and committee staff. The community is brought into the process of developing those reports which are in the form of advice to the Senate. When so much work is put in, one would have thought that an individual senator, having done months of work, would be given more than 10 minutes to speak to his or her contribution to that report and the recommendations. Under this proposal such debate will be put off until Wednesday and Thursday; there will be simply a one-hour maximum, no matter how important the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Christmas, we had one matter which was of critical importance on sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act which was going to severely reduce the capacity of small business to deal with secondary boycotts. This debate demanded more than an hour. The government was embarrassed by that debate, so we find before us today an effort to restrict those debates to a maximum of one hour, and for speakers to be also severely limited to a maximum of 10 minutes each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposal, general business, which is the opposition's one time of the week to really raise an issue that has been notified under considered notice at an earlier time, will in effect also be squeezed out. This squeezing out will occur by virtue of the fact that it is the last item of business on this schedule that is before us on the Thursday before the cut-off of the adjournment. From past practice we know that previous government business earlier in the day has the effect of squeezing that back, so that on so many occasions the opposition's general business is dealt with on Thursday night. Those Thursday nights will not exist. The capacity of the opposition to raise matters that are important to it as an alternative government will be lost by the adoption of this reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters of public importance and urgency debates are another option open to the opposition to raise issues that are important at the time and should be debated in the national interest. We have the capacity at present to debate those matters for two hours when they are raised. The two hours is not always used. If the issue can be dealt with in a shorter period, we go to the government and say, `We want to raise this matter of public interest, but believe that we can deal with it in an hour', and therefore do not fully utilise the time that is available. In other words, we seek the necessary time to develop the argument according to the circumstances of that argument. Under this package, however, the time for MPIs and urgency debates will be reduced from a maximum of two hours to one hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Panizza says, it is not a right that we abuse. We have been raising very few such issues in recent times and, in effect, allowing the government further time for its program. But, importantly, the flexibility is there&mdash;the capacity exists, if the circumstances demand it, for this chamber to be effective in its accountability function by utilising the time available on the issue which is of such moment on the day. Under this package, however, that is further restricted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find that the adjournment debate is restricted, the capacity for committee reports to be brought down and debated is restricted, general business is squeezed out, the time for urgent debates and MPIs is restricted further and the occasions when government reports can be brought on is further restricted. Looking at that, one can objectively reach only one conclusion: the capacity of the Senate to effectively scrutinise government will be reduced. That is disappointing and will reduce the effectiveness of this body. I should have thought that would worry the Australian Democrats and the Greens, as it worries us, but it seems that it does not. I will be interested to hear their participation in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says, `All of this is necessary because we have had legislation by exhaustion'. In some ways, he has blamed the sitting times and the procedural structures in this place for that occurrence. That is unfair. The legislation by exhaustion has been at the choice of the government&mdash;it has been a result of the government's specifically planned and designed programming, and the government's determination to achieve an outcome. A classic example of that in the last session was where the two largest and most profound pieces of legislation before the chamber were debated in this place in the last sitting fortnight. I am referring to major changes to the industrial relations package and the native title legislation which could have been brought forward but the government chose not to. The government left them at the end of the program, to be dealt with by a process of exhaustion through dealing with the Greens and the Democrats. The adjournment was lifted, debate continued and, at the end, the guillotine was applied. The government chose to legislate by exhaustion; this process had nothing to do with the procedures of this place at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister constantly uses this example by saying, `It is not working'. Yet in the first three weeks of the last session very little legislation was debated. That was the choice of the government&mdash;the government runs the program in this place. The government chose to raise other matters such as procedural debates and other matters of its choice other than legislation. It now has the nerve to come in here and blame us for the fact that little legislation was debated. That was the choice of the government and it should stand by the consequences of that rather than seek to attribute blame to this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, nothing in these proposals overcomes legislation by exhaustion. There is nothing here which ensures orderly programming by the government&mdash;nothing to ensure that the government brings in its legislation during the course of the session in order to have such legislation reasonably debated at sensible times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no guarantee that we will not experience exactly what we have experienced in the past. When we get to the end of this session the government, with the agreement of the Greens and the Democrats, will suspend this sessional order in order that it might have these all night debates and push through legislation by exhaustion. I am sure that today the Greens and the Democrats will say, `We will not be a party to that', but they say that every time. Every time it has been put to the test, the Greens and the Democrats have buckled under and agreed to the government's proposals. I remember Senator Bourne shaking her head. How many times have the Democrats said, `We are not going to negate the adjournment any more because we are worried about the health of the staff'? But, when it has come to the crunch, they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often the Democrats and the Greens say, `We will not agree to the guillotine and cut off the right of debate in this chamber'&mdash;the real chamber of debate of the Australian parliament. But, when it comes to the crunch and Senator Faulkner walks over to the other side of the chamber they say, `Okay, on this occasion we will make an exception and agree to the guillotine and debate can be curtailed'. That will happen again. There is nothing in this proposal that stops the all night sittings because the government will suspend the sessional order when it suits it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the concept of all night sittings in the process of legislation by exhaustion is appalling and is bad legislative practice. That is why we sought&mdash;and we did it in conjunction with the minority parties&mdash;to try and impose limits on the government that required it to introduce its legislation early in a session. That was abused by the government. The government stacked the legislation in the other chamber. We took a further step&mdash;this time with the support of the Greens&mdash;to impose a second tier requiring the government to introduce legislation in the House of Representatives at an earlier date so that we could not then be blamed for inadequate debate in that chamber. But the government was not prepared to accept the spirit of that, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that effort to ensure orderly programming, and therefore sensible debate, the Prime Minister lifted the capacity of the opposition to conduct its affairs in the traditional way; in other words, to censure the government or to move matters of public importance. It demonstrated&mdash;if there was need for further demonstration&mdash;how this government is not interested in proper orderly programming. Orderly programming solves the problem. This reform package before us today does not solve the problem. Unfortunately, when one looks at it as a whole, all it really does is further reduce the capacity of this chamber to be effective. That is our principal objective. We will participate and work towards constructive reform. I have mentioned our efforts that have contributed to the Friday committee hearings. These committee hearings are reasonably useful and can even further enhance the capability of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sought&mdash;and we are going to seek again&mdash;to introduce the concept of a minimum number of questions so that the government can be put under further scrutiny each day through the question time procedure. The government's response was not only what we see before us today, but let us remember what we have had in recent times. Unfortunately&mdash;again with the support of the minority parties&mdash;we have had the vote in this place to reduce the quorum so that senators need not participate to the full extent in this chamber. That is something that is particularly convenient to ministers, and that was the motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the debate earlier last year to reduce the speaking times in this place. No real case was made out as to why that should be so, but the government got the numbers with the support of the minority parties and reduced the times available for speaking. In so many instances that is now to be further reduced&mdash;again, sadly, with the support of the minority parties. The government came into this place and reduced the number of legislative and standing committees&mdash;again, unfortunately, with the support of the minority parties. The whole trend has been away from effective scrutiny of government performance. The government has achieved this with the support of the minority parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the government's motivation, but I cannot understand the motivation of the Democrats and the Greens to that objective. I know that they see the function of facilitating the government's legislative program as a higher priority than we do. But to do that at the expense of the fundamental capability of this chamber to demand accountability is clearly regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will be moving a number of amendments to change the government's proposal. These amendments will restore some of those capabilities. I have had circulated in the chamber some 18 amendments, and accordingly I move:</PARA>

<PARA>The first of these amendments deals with a matter that I have not mentioned. The government wishes us to start sitting at 9.30 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays. I am advised that that will significantly eat into time that is currently used by important committees of this chamber. It is unnecessary to do that, so we are proposing that the starting time be 10 o'clock rather than 9.30 a.m.. This will better facilitate the broader operation of this chamber. The second amendment seeks to lift the absolute cut-off of the adjournment. We do not mind that the question on the adjournment be put, but the maximum restraint of 40 minutes should be lifted. My amendment changes that back to the current position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment seeks to omit paragraph (2)(b) of the proposal before us. That also deals with the 40 minute timetable and the 10 minutes allowed for each speaker on the adjournment. My fourth proposal is to omit paragraph (2)(c). That again relates to the absolute cut-off after 40 minutes of debate on the adjournment. The fifth amendment is to insert a new item after paragraph (3)(a). The amendment reads `Any debate on committee reports'. This will introduce greater capacity in the Senate to debate its own committees' work. It is pointless to put hundreds of hours of effort into committee reports if they are then not properly and fully debated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My sixth amendment will ensure that government documents are debated for up to 30 minutes each day. I have already given reasons for that. This would restore something that is in the best interests of this chamber. I cannot think of any argument to the contrary. The seventh amendment seeks to omit item (viii) from paragraph (3)(a). This relates to a further restriction that was put on government documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth amendment omits item (vii) from paragraph (3)(b), which changes the schedule by further removing government business at that time. The ninth amendment relates to consideration of government business. Some of these amendments are aimed at removing the relevant clauses from the proposal before us and then inserting the changes that I have mentioned. So, although there are 18 separate amendments, there are not actually 18 separate items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tenth amendment seeks to remove item (xiii) from paragraph (3)(b). This paragraph also relates to government documents. We believe that we should be able to deal with documents each day, rather than follow the procedure that is set out in this proposal. Amendment 11 relates to general business on a Thursday. We are proposing that if general business has not been called on earlier, it be called on at 4.30 p.m. If these changes were not made, debate on general business would be squeezed out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 12 has been particularly promoted by my colleague Senator Kemp to ensure that a minimum number of 28 questions are asked at question time. That will further improve the accountability capacity of this chamber. I would have thought that amendment would certainly be supported by the minority parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 13 would omit paragraph (4). Again, that affects government documents so that they will be dealt with in the way I have already outlined. Amendment 14 substitutes the words `any day' for the words `Wednesday or Thursday' in paragraph (5)(a). That also relates to government business. Amendment 15 would remove paragraph (5)(b), the paragraph that provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Senator speaking to such a motion shall not speak for more than 10 minutes, and debate on all such motions shall not exceed one hour.</PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 16 would remove paragraph (5)(c), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a debate is not concluded at the expiration of that time the debate shall be made an order of the day for Thursday at the time for consideration of committee reports.</PARA>
<PARA>That would take from the time available for consideration of committee reports. We need a greater capacity to deal with those sorts of matters. We do not want them shuffled off to the Thursday and then squeezed out with general business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By amendment 17 we seek to omit paragraph (6), the one whereby the government is seeking to utilise the two lunch hours on Wednesday and Thursday, even though they are asking the Senate to sit from 9.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. The government has not made out a case for that so we are seeking to reduce it to one lunch hour. We think that is sensible and feel that it would be accepted by the majority. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, amendment 18 would enable us, in the event that there is no time for an MPI or a matter of urgency, to seek the alternative of time allowed for further debate on matters arising out of question time. That is a change that would not take up government time. In effect, it would be a reshuffling of the business of the Senate to better reflect the issues of importance on that particular day. In other words, if issues that we think are of great importance to the nation come out of question time rather than pre-planned matters of public importance, we should have the flexibility to debate them. That would be another sensible reform. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the proposed starting times of 2 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays and 9.30 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays, originally we were going to have a starting time of 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, the trade-off for that being extra time for one adjournment debate while still finishing at 8 o'clock. The opposition, through Senator Teague, put a very cogent case for needing the extra morning for party meetings, shadow cabinet meetings and that sort of thing. That seemed reasonable so we recommended a 2 p.m. start on Mondays and Tuesdays and a 9.30 a.m. start on Wednesdays and Thursdays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra half hour should not make too much difference. Whips' meetings could be held a bit earlier&mdash;I know that I get in a lot earlier&mdash;while printing of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order of Business </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> will also have to start a bit earlier. That is a bit of a nuisance but it only entails half an hour and there is extra time the night before and on Wednesday and Thursday nights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adjournment has caused a lot of angst. When we looked at this whole question of change to procedure, our starting point was Senator Herron's very compulsive submission to the committee that we should finish at 8.00 p.m. no matter what; that we should be able to rely upon 8.00 p.m. as an absolute finishing time. We decided that we would work backwards from that. In so doing, we looked at the sort of adjournment debates we have been having and the length of time we thought was reasonable. We ended up with a proposal for a maximum of 40 minutes on the adjournment with 10 minutes for each speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill said in his contribution to this debate, the average time for each speaker on the adjournment in the last budget session was about seven minutes. The average time on the adjournment in total last session was about 22 minutes. So there is no reason for an unlimited adjournment debate. If it happens that some person needs the full 40 minutes, I do not think honourable senators will be unreasonable. This has only ever happened a couple of times and leave has always been granted. If honourable senators have something reasonable to talk about, they can ask for an extra 10 minutes and, if it is before 8.00 p.m., they will be granted that extra 10 minutes. I am absolutely sure of that. They have only got to be reasonable. The vast majority of us in this place are reasonable. We do not always sound like it, I know, but we are. So that was looked at and agreed to by all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point concerns motions to take note of answers. That time has been taken up. Last session we allowed 30 minutes for taking note of answers after question time had finished&mdash;and all of that time has been used. We have used almost the entire 30 minutes every day since then for taking note of answers. Having that time was not a right and had never been a right; this arrangement was only recently introduced into this place. This time is used to effect by opposition senators and by some government senators&mdash;I know one or two of our senators have used it to effect. All of us find that we can use it usefully. That is now a right; and it is accepted that there will be a maximum of 30 minutes each day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also provided that any part of that 30 minutes which is not taken up can be added on to the hour that we have allowed for debate on a MPI. Some opposition senators feel that there should be flexibility when a really important topic is being discussed and that such a MPI should run for 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes. But if one honourable senator cannot get through a speech in 10 minutes, somebody else can bring up more points and the time can be used effectively. Senator Harradine unfortunately is alone and cannot get other people to make more points for him. Given that, Senator Harradine was on the procedure committee, and has been very generous in allowing this suggestion. I suppose he may vote against it. </PARA>

He is very effective at using this chamber. I am sure that if anybody can find ways to use it, it is Senator Harradine. If the full half hour of taking note is not taken up, it can be used for the MPI, giving a maximum of 90 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put in one hour for MPI and urgency motions each day. For most debates we have an hour. We use two hours only if it is a quiet day at the beginning of the session. We have used one hour for ages; and that one hour is what we have agreed to in the new scheme of things. That would allow 10 minutes per speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of committee reports and government responses has also caused some angst. At the moment time for that is unlimited; but that is not a right. It is done by leave. We thought it should be a right. This matter has been brought before the procedure committee, I think twice in the last year or two, and we could never agree. So we erred on the generous side of what we looked at before in the procedure committee. We have come up with an hour on Wednesday, an hour on Thursday morning and an extra 50 minutes on Thursday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill was right when he said that we did not have to have that extra 50 minutes, according to what we had put. We meant to put that in and I am sure Senator Teague will agree that that was the spirit of the entire procedure committee&mdash;that the 50 minutes extra should have been in. That is brought up in one of Senator Hill's amendments&mdash;which I think is a very good amendment&mdash;that we start general business at 4.30 p.m., no matter what else is happening. We will stop, the way we would stop everything for question time, and we will start general business at 4.30 p.m. That will allow the hour for documents, the hour for business and the 50 minutes for government responses and any committee reports which we have not got through in the two hours that we have had on the Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Nothing will be allowed to stop that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past&mdash;we would all agree I am sure if we looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;we have not had many government responses. We have not got to them because we have started general business a little later. The committee did not want that; we think this is very important. It is the one part of the week where the opposition has an absolute time. It knows it can count on that time and should always be able to do so. That is what we wanted and it is contained in Senator Hill's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committee reports over the last budget session have taken an average of 124 minutes a week. We have allowed 170 minutes in the new scheme, which I think should work out quite well. The problem with committee reports and government responses is that when committees are on something big such as the splitting of tax bills or sections 45D and 45E, the reports do not come up in a neat way; they are not spread evenly throughout the session or the year. We have to make a bit more of an effort to get our committees to report back in a more organised way. If we put some thought into that, it will work. If it does not work, we will have to look at changing it. But we should try it first. We cannot say it is not going to work without trying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing I want to look at is the House of Representatives reforms. The House of Representatives is looking at the same sort of thing as we are. It has come up with a timetable which is fairly similar to ours. It is interesting to note that the opposition members on the House of Representatives procedure committee have put in a dissenting report which is almost the same as our unanimous report. That is very sensible. Unfortunately, in their dissenting report they have not allowed as much time for consideration of committee reports, documents or MPIs as we have, but that is a function of the House of Representatives. Senator Hill is correct when he says, `This is the place where most scrutiny goes on, rather than the Representatives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible for those in the House of Representatives to get all that extra time that we think is necessary to look at committee reports, documents, MPIs, ministerial statements and that sort of thing. I hope their dissenting report does well because it is very similar to our unanimous report; and I think our unanimous report is pretty good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about flexibility is a bit unfair. We will not know until we have tried it out for a little while, but I think the flexibility is there. Committee report time can be used. There will be more committee report time because we will have general business set at 4.30 p.m. There will be the same amount of document time. We are not using it up now. I imagine if we say to people, `You have this amount of time', they will start using it up. That, in some ways, is a pity, but as we all know, work expands to fill the time we allow for it. But it is going to have to contract to fill the time allowed, in some cases. In this case it will not have to contract; I am afraid it will expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about committees in the mornings is interesting. There are committee meetings in the mornings at the moment, but that is mostly because we cannot have them in the evenings. The reason we cannot have them in the evenings is that we finish at 10.30 p.m. or later. The fact that we will be finishing at 8 p.m, and we can count on finishing at 8 p.m, will mean the committee meetings will move from some mornings into some evenings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good argument in the House of Representatives procedure committee report that that is not a good thing on every evening, and that we should set aside a couple of evenings when that cannot be done. We can do that by agreement. It is not in this report and we would have to do it by agreement to start with; but I think it is worth while. We have to look at whether we will agree to committees sitting on, say, Thursday or Wednesday nights&mdash;I do not know which. Maybe we should start with two nights and see whether that works. We could go to one if it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these things involve flexibility. Flexibility is what we are after&mdash;and it is very important. The question of flexibility is a big one, but it cannot be determined until we have tried it; and if it does not work, we can change it. That is the most important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have two lunchtime debates, one of which concerns matters of public interest&mdash;almost exclusively the opposition's and which, I believe, it is trying to get rid of&mdash;and one of which concerns non-controversial government business, which is also important. Both those debates have been used to the maximum. They could have been allowed more time. We have had them on one lunch time per week for the last year or two. In the last session we used up almost the entire lunch time every day they were on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obviously a need for that opportunity; the debate has expanded to fill the space that was allowed for it. I think it is only fair to allow a whole lunchtime for such matters. We must remember that these are non-controversial matters. If there are not enough people to speak we do not have it, but if those people want to speak they should have the flexibility to do that. We allow a whole lunchtime for non-controversial business and to get rid of the bills that nobody wants to speak on because they are non-controversial. They are usually just machinery matters that go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said to me that there is a problem with staff over lunchtimes. We have had in the past&mdash;I think there has been only one occasion when it has not happened&mdash;a gentleperson's agreement amongst all of us that there will be no quorums or divisions called in those lunchtimes. Because that has happened consistently, I would expect it to continue to happen consistently. Staff do not have to monitor the chamber. If honourable senators have a bill or an MPI, it is their responsibility to be in the chamber to speak to the bill or to their matter of public interest. If they are not here, they miss out. They have agreed to it beforehand&mdash;it is all very simple&mdash;and there is no reason why anybody should have to monitor that. If honourable senators cannot do that themselves, that is their problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that those two hours should stay. If we have consistently only half an hour on one day of opposition senators speaking on matters of public interest and half an hour on the other day on non-controversial bills, then we can put them back together again, as they are now, and nothing will have changed. I believe that is a good change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the members of the working group all got on very well, which was good. I would like to thank my two colleagues on that working group for their very hard work. I know that Senator Teague in particular had not an easy time going back to the opposition and arguing these cases. He did it very effectively and terribly diligently. He was very good at that. He came up with some very good ideas. It is so long since we did this&mdash;the report came down in September&mdash;that I cannot for the life of me remember what some of his ideas were, but I am sure he will tell us. They were good ideas and they were ones that we put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner went back to the government and got agreement from all government senators for these things. In some cases that would not have been easy either because government business has been cut down in the same way as opposition business. All business has been cut down because we are working shorter hours. If we had worked that extra morning we would have had a little more time, but we are not going to. If we agree that we are going to get up at 8.00 p.m., then we get up at 8.00 p.m. We all have to make some small sacrifices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other person who deserves a great deal of credit for a lot of this work is Senator Herron, whose submission to the committee was very comprehensive. It was alarmingly convincing on the health consequences of sitting long and ridiculous hours and the effects of sleep deprivation on the human being's capacity for making competent decisions, and I found it somewhat shocking. I recommend this submission to all honourable senators before they vote on this question. I think it is a very good and comprehensive submission. Senator Herron is somebody we want to have on our side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I point out that this is a sessional order; it is not a change to standing orders at the moment. If it does not work we automatically go back to our current somewhat ridiculous timetable after the next election. If it does work we will all, I am sure, be really enthusiastic about changing standing orders during the life of this parliament. As a member of the Procedure Committee, I intend to ask for a review of the way these changes are working by the start of next year. I know that Senator Faulkner and Senator Teague think we can do that a little earlier, and I think they are probably right. The three of us can look at the way this is working, probably around the middle of the year. If there are any obvious terrible flaws in it, we will find them way before then and we will be able to change them. I do not think there are any terrible flaws; I hope not. But nothing is perfect, and I imagine that this will need some tinkering around the edges. However, we will not know until we have tried it. We cannot say, `I am not going to try something because it might not work out'. The odds are, I think, that this will work, and work well, and the sooner we try it the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a motion on restructuring of committees, incorporating Senator Hill's motion on chairs of committees, passed this morning by the Senate, and I thank the Senate for that. We are taking that one very seriously, too. That is another reform of the Senate that we think should come sooner rather than later. We on the Procedure Committee are looking forward to getting lots of submissions from honourable senators; I am going back to my office in a moment to write mine. We hope to see an interesting restructuring of committees, particularly of committee chairs, in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my favourite memorials&mdash;statues, national monuments&mdash;in Australia is in Melbourne. It is the eight-hour day statue at the end of Lonsdale Street. As a senator for the last 16 years, I have had great pleasure in driving past the eight-hour day statue whenever I have been in Melbourne on parliamentary business. I look at that statue and I see eight hours work, eight hours leisure or rest, and eight hours sleep. I say to myself that if 50 years ago the workers of Australia got an eight-hour day, there has to be some hope for politicians that we will get a 16-hour day, at least in my time of tenure in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do recognise the remarks made by a number of us, not only in this debate but earlier, that it is the case that we have a minimum 12-hour day, and I would argue that it is more like 16 for most of us, especially on days when we are here in Canberra. There does need to be reform, and I have always accepted Senator Herron's professional judgment about stress and the intolerable practice of sitting night after night beyond midnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reform in the air with regard to the sitting hours. The House of Representatives this week, I understand, is adopting a new sitting hour pattern that will be very similar to the one put forward in the motion before the Senate today. Also, for the first time we will have a budget in May instead of August, and this has led to a sitting pattern in three blocks through the year rather than one each in autumn and spring. Of course, the autumn and spring sessions have blown out to more than two-thirds of the year. However, I know that there is reform about, and we need to take into account the new sitting blocks and the views of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a zero sum gain in all of this because there are only 24 hours in a day and honourable senators have responsibilities apart from this chamber. We have committee work to do on non-sitting days and we have constituents. I have one and one-third million constituents in my state of South Australia and I love to listen to them, to be with them. As a politician, I believe that the best prospect I have for my party to win government is to ensure that my colleagues and I maximise the time we have in the electorate, hearing views and also putting forward views on our own behalf on what we would be doing in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to correct one matter. There is talk amongst some of us in the Senate that government business is somehow favouring the government or is the government's responsibility. I put it to the Senate that the legislation of Australia, the law making of Australia, is every senators' business. Whilst it is the case that the government of the day proposes most laws, what is written down as government business can be equally written down as legislation. This is the only effective legislative debate in this country with regard to any federal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not seek to reflect upon the other house but, unfortunately, the iron numbers of government majority in the House of Representatives mean that the government always wins. There is a record of years and years with no amendments and often no substantial debate in the House of Representatives on any legislation. This Senate is the legislative debating chamber with regard to all federal laws. As senators, we must ensure that there is proper time to have our say on what will be the laws of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to a number of points of misunderstanding that have been circulating in recent months, not least in the last few days. The first is with regard to general business. As Senator Bourne said, it was never the intention of the Procedure Committee or any member of it to reduce for one minute or in any other way general business on Thursdays. I very much welcome the clarification on this matter from Senator Hill with regard to amendment No. 11 of the package of amendments he has moved, which will ensure that general business starts at 4.30 p.m. and that nothing that we have known over all these years with regard to general business is in any whit diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second misunderstanding is that government documents will be discussed on only two days a week. That is not correct. By this motion government documents may be discussed on three days a week; that is, six days a fortnight. At the moment, we debate them on seven days a fortnight, so there is a change from seven to six days. The point is that it is our understanding that no government documents will be tabled on a Monday and, therefore, senators will not lose their ability to speak while a document is hot&mdash;while it has just been tabled&mdash;in that period of reflection. In the give and take of making a package that will allow for legislative debate, I believe that it is reasonable, as a sessional order, to see six out of eight days on which we can have all of the present abilities with regard to government documents. The actual time available for government documents exceeds by a long way the time that has been spent on government documents in many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of misunderstanding concerns committee reports and government responses to committee reports. I am as much as, if not more than, any other senator a stalwart of the Senate committee system. I have participated in 100-plus inquiries through committees of the Senate. I have, as is well known, strongly supported retaining the structure of our Senate standing committees as well as estimates, select and other committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear that at the moment those who speak on Senate committee reports do so by leave. For example, yesterday, while I was in the chair of the Senate, Senator McKiernan presented the government's response to a very important committee report on the Family Law Act. As the chairman of that committee, he obviously wanted to speak on that vital document containing the government's response to the work of those senators on the committee. He rose and sought leave to speak. Of course he was given leave because it would be a nonsense for him not to be able to immediately respond. He did so with discipline in a matter of 10 minutes. Four other senators&mdash;Senators Kemp, Campbell, Coates and Watson&mdash;also sought leave and spoke with discipline on a matter regarding salaries. We have in the committee report suggestion in this motion a definite right to deal with Senate committee reports and government responses for a minimum of one hour on Wednesday mornings and one hour on Thursday mornings and for the overflow not to be lost off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> forever, but to be an order of the Senate to be considered in general business, as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the adjournment debate, none of us likes to see a reduction in the flexibility of individual senators. When I first came to this chamber, I could speak on any matter for 60 minutes. I could get up on any bill and give a one-hour speech on any matter before us. No-one contemplates a 60-minute speech for senators. We would be sitting on not only Christmas Day and Good Friday, but also into the early hours of the morning every day. There is a zero sum gain in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this proposal is supported by the Senate, a minimum of 21 adjournment speeches will be able to be given in any one sitting week&mdash;four each evening for 10 minutes each and five on Wednesday lunchtimes for 15 minutes each. That number of 21 spots exceeds the number of adjournment speeches that have been given in recent years. Also, the time available is double that which has been spent in recent years. In my view, the flexibility that must be retained is the ability to be given leave. Leave ought to be given in this chamber in the traditional way that we see now. If someone has a substantial speech&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to piggeries. I will give an instance of my own. I gave a 30-minute adjournment speech three years ago on why I believed it was time to come back to normal relations with China. The foreign minister, Senator Evans, gave me a great kindness in attending and listening to that speech. This being a genuine bipartisan approach, a couple of weeks later Australia normalised relations with China&mdash;a year and a half after the terrible Tiananmen events. I had just come back from China. I had a series of speeches that I could make only on the adjournment. I gave a 30-minute address. I believe that any senator who wants to make a 20-minute or 30-minute address on the adjournment should be able, through the whips, to seek leave to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to piggeries, which Senator Kemp keeps coming back to, I concede that if Senator Baume, for example, wanted to give a speech on the Prime Minister's piggery, his personal financial interest in such a piggery and whether it is consistent with the ethics and behaviour we in the parliament would accept of a Prime Minister, he would not be given leave to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I concede that we have the opportunity to debate an MPI every day. This is clearly a matter in which the opposition would have a major interest and, therefore, it would be appropriate, being a directly political matter, for the Prime Minister's piggery to be the subject of an MPI that day rather than a 20-minute adjournment speech by one opposition senator in the evening. That would necessitate a government response on the matter; it would allow Independent and Democrat senators to speak on the same issue; and it would demand, in the one hour that is set aside every day for an matter of public importance, an answer from the government with regard to anything that we saw as lacking and, as Senator Kemp knows, there are matters lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another misunderstanding is the reference to lunchtimes and late dinners. On Wednesdays and Thursdays it is proposed that the sittings of the Senate begin at 9.30 a.m. and conclude, at the latest, at 8.00 p.m. However, the only business that can be conducted during lunchtime on Wednesday and Thursday is non-controversial legislation or a matter of public interest, as now, and which absolutely precludes divisions. We are well versed in these two activities during Thursday lunchtimes. There has been no trouble with it. It was in the mind of the members of the Procedure Committee to extend this to enable those senators who wanted to make a contribution, such as an adjournment speech on a matter of public interest, to have 15 minutes on a Wednesday if they wished. The requirement for staff, at that time, is minimal. If a senator does not know all of the advice from a staff member by the time that Wednesday lunchtime begins, there is something lacking in that person's preparation. If there is a need to have some whip's clerk monitoring this matter, there will need to be a roster for substitution&mdash;just like in a hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospitals operate 24 hours a day, but that does not mean that every doctor and every nurse has to attend 24 hours a day. There is a sharing of the load, and it is reasonable. Where there is a vital job&mdash;and I regard, in these matters, the vital job as the whip's clerk; we happen to have an excellent whip's clerk&mdash;there will need to be that degree of flexibility for that one hour on Wednesdays. With regard to the dinner break, let it be understood that at 6.50 p.m. it is proposed to debate government documents. If a senator is not prepared, with staff support, to speak at 6.50 p.m., he or she is lacking in preparation. The adjournment is at 7.20 p.m. Again, if senators are not ready to go on the adjournment with their speeches, they are lacking in preparation. There is no essential need for staff support beyond 6.50 p.m., except in very rare cases. Therefore, the staff, and senators at large, can have their normal meal from 6.50 p.m. With regard to the dining rooms, it is a management question which must be met to allow for dinner after 8.00 p.m. in any event. That probably means until nine o'clock on any evening the Senate is sitting. That is achievable, and what we gain is the advantages of the package. I wished to clarify that misunderstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate to the chamber that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, spoke with measure, credibility and genuineness. I believe that he spoke accurately. I say the same of the contributions by Senator Bourne and Senator Hill. There was a constructive and measured contribution from the three who preceded me, and I welcome that. Let us deal with this matter constructively and with an ability to persuade a majority to any particular position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to conclude with three points. Firstly, this is a free vote. All senators are free to make up their minds on any matter of procedure. This is not a whipped party vote&mdash;that is why I am sure all honourable senators are listening to the contributions that are being made in this debate. Every senator will sit on one side or the other with regard to the  18 amendments and to the matter as a whole. It is a matter for the individual. There is no whip. It has always been the case with procedural matters on how we conduct ourselves in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I wish to refer to the need for further reform. I welcome all that Senator Bourne has said about the committee system inquiry. I have long advocated a sharing of committee chairmanship of all Senate committees reflective of the composition of the Senate, not reflective of which party happens to be the executive government. I believe that that is a reform we ought to see in place before Easter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the reform that most bears upon this debate that I wish to strongly advocate is when we get to the cut-off times&mdash;Senator Hill rightly referred to these reforms initiated by the Democrats and Senator Chamarette, with opposition support over recent years&mdash;for the introduction of legislation that can be completed in a session, the Manager of Government Business and the whips ought to see that those bills can be contemplated for the rest of the session and to allocate, informally, an appropriate number of hours per bill for the remainder of the session, understanding that there will be one half to two-thirds of the time we sit available for legislation. Therefore, we will not see the bunching up of a hundred bills in the final two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rational that when we get to the cut-off point, knowing when our last sitting day is, we allocate a certain number of hours. I am not advocating a guillotine; I am advocating an informal and rational agreement. It can be put by the whips to their party rooms in draft form and they can come back with a confirmed allocation of the hours that are available. There is a zero sum gain. If one party had a constructive view that there was no way in the world the allocated hours for that bill could be in any way adequate, the only way to argue for the adequacy of hours would be to say that we must therefore sit on extra days. I believe that with this general reform, from the cut-off date till the end of every session, there will be such a working relationship. We have moved somewhat towards it, but I believe only in the last two weeks. We need to work on it in the last six weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a contribution on this important debate. I want to briefly refer to one of the comments that my colleague Senator Teague made. I do not argue that a major function of this chamber is to discuss government legislation&mdash;quite obviously, that is a major function. An equally major function of this chamber is to allow people who are not members of the government to raise issues of considerable concern to them. What worries me about some of these reforms is that when the whole package is considered we find that the time to discuss issues of particular concern and priority to non-government members has been greatly cut and restricted. I think that is a pity.</PARA></TALK.START>

Under the package we have before us we will get five hours less in that area. I think we have used that procedure responsibly in this chamber. It is not used every day. Nonetheless, when a major issue arises there is the flexibility to use it. It surprises me that in a package of reforms on the procedures of the Senate we would lose such a substantial amount of an area in which we can raise issues of concern to ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of people have referred to the fact that the adjournment debate, coming at the end of the day, for a long period of time has been used in a responsible fashion. The overall statistics show, quite consistently over a period of time, that up to 28 or 29 minutes are used on average for the adjournment debate, with two or three speakers, each speaking in the order of 10 minutes. So there is a very flexible arrangement which has generally been well used. Issues of major importance come up on occasion and people take longer on the adjournment debate to suss out such problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked upon the transformation of Senator Faulkner with great interest since he assumed the office of Manager of Government Business in the Senate. From time to time he has attempted to portray a very reasonable approach, which is certainly an approach that we welcome, but I have to say that I saw elements of the old Senator Faulkner when he commenced his speech and spoke about the major reforms that his government has brought into parliamentary procedures. I think there would be universal agreement that the approach of the government to parliament as a whole, particularly under Mr Keating, has turned the proceedings of the other place into a farce. I have to say the gall of the Labor Party never ceases to amaze me in that a senior member can stand up with a straight face and talk about the government's commitment to parliamentary reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a large number of efforts to make changes in relation to the Senate, some of which I have welcomed. Although at the start I was somewhat cautious about the changes to the estimates committee arrangements, I think they are working well. I do not know whether that is your view, Madam Acting Deputy President, but it seems to me that, at least in some areas, the ability to have ministers and public servants back to question them is a plus, although I do not welcome some other restrictions in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators look at the so-called reforms that have been brought in, they will note certain things. We have limits on second reading speeches. We have had fewer questions at question time in this chamber under the Hawke and Keating governments than in any other period for which we have been able to calculate the number of questions, so the scrutiny which occurs at question time has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had more use made of the guillotine by this government than by any other government since federation. The figures show an enormous use of the guillotine in both houses of parliament over the life of the Labor government. From 1901 to 1982, for example, only 208 bills had been subject to the guillotine in the other place. Since 1983&mdash;since the Labor government came to office&mdash;over 600 bills have been guillotined through the House of Representatives. In the Senate we have seen equally constant use of the guillotine at the end of sessions. It is regrettable that the minor parties, particularly the Democrats, have cooperated with the government in the use of that guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner said that&mdash;I think with the general good wishes of people&mdash;a whole new arrangement has been brought in and that this government will now make sure that its legislative program is carefully ordered and done in a way which will give plenty of time for scrutiny by both houses of parliament. We welcome that. That is an interesting commitment, but nothing in these arrangements requires that. We have to say, in fairness, that the government's record over a long period now has been quite the reverse. In fact, this government has very poorly ordered its program. It has deliberately kept controversial bills till the last moment so that they can be rammed through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently the leopard has changed its spots, or the zebra has changed its stripes, and we are going to see a whole new world opened up as one of the trade-offs for these restrictions which are being placed on the opposition. I think Senator Teague would agree with me that nothing in these arrangements requires that. So we have a government, whose record has been appalling, now saying that these new arrangements, which in many ways restrict the options of people on our side of the chamber to make comments, are the trade-off. We wait in hope to see how Senator Faulkner and his colleagues deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise with this chamber a couple of other points which go back to the philosophy of what this chamber is really about. I would have thought the thing that would have guided most senators&mdash;certainly those not on the government side&mdash;is the need to increase the opportunities for government accountability. One of the big dilemmas in modern society and in the law-making arrangements is the total domination of the parliament by the executive. The question is: how can we really return parliament to its proper role of making the government, making the executive, more accountable? If we were to wind back the advantages and privileges groups have, that process would, of course, inevitably be painful. I never cease to be surprised that it seems to be so difficult in this chamber to encourage the Democrats and sometimes the Greens to join with us to bring in arrangements and procedures which force greater accountability on the government and increase the opportunities for non-government senators to question the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our proposals is to increase the number of questions to government ministers in question time. That is not a very controversial proposal. If the question were asked, `Should government ministers answer more questions than they do?', I think people would generally say that it was a good idea and that we could have some shorter answers. When we add to that argument the fact that, where statistics are available, on average 28 to 30 questions a day have been answered by other governments in the past, is it not reasonable in this place to require government ministers to match those numbers of questions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This procedure sets a minimum number of 28 questions in question time. The current arrangement delivers to us about 23 questions on average in question time compared with 22 questions over the previous years of the Labor government. All these changes that have been brought into question time have delivered, at the most, one extra question a day. Under my proposal&mdash;and I have received this advice from the Clerk&mdash;the Democrats would receive one extra question a day, making a total of three. At present they receive two on average. My proposal would increase the capacity of the Democrats&mdash;and, indeed, the Greens and Senator Harradine&mdash;to ask more questions. It is fully in line with established precedent in this chamber on the numbers of questions which can reasonably be asked. It would advantage the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents. I listened carefully to Senator Bourne but I did not detect any comment from her on this particular matter. I certainly hope that she and her colleagues will join with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue on which I had hoped to hear Senator Bourne speak was that of taking note of the answer. The trade-off proposed in one of the amendments moved by Senator Hill would be that if the hour allowed for a matter of public importance motion were not used on a particular day, the 30 minutes given for taking note of an answer could be extended to an hour. That would be a very constructive proposal and would save half an hour as against the proposed arrangements, which give a total of an hour and a half. Under our proposal, if we decided to forgo the matter of public importance, the total amount of time taken up would be 60 minutes. Thus we would be saving time and we would see that as a valid trade-off to increase the flexibility that senators may have. On some days taking note of answers might be seen to be a priority and would give more senators a chance to contribute to a wider range of issues. I believe that is a very reasonable proposal and I had hoped that we might have had some comment from Senator Bourne on that matter. I may be wrong, but my memory is that she did not address that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the Australian Democrats and the Greens see the general philosophy which should underlie all changes in this chamber as being to increase government accountability and increase pressure on the government to explain what it is doing. It is a pity that in so many areas we have not enjoyed support from them for arrangements which are reasonable and moderate and which would put increased pressure on the government. I note Senator Bourne said that the Democrats were keen to look closely at the issue of chairmen of committees. That is an important initiative and we certainly hope that it will receive the support of the Democrats. In the recent debate that we had relating to the President and Deputy President, I think Senator Bourne said that the Democrats did not feel it was appropriate that one party should hold both posts. Equally, the same argument applies to chairmen of committees; it is not appropriate that one party&mdash;the government party&mdash;should hold all the chairs of the legislative and standing committees. I certainly hope that we can make some important changes and reforms in that area. </PARA>

If it was the staff member, presumably he was acting on the delegated authority of the minister. I ask: was there any delegated authority in writing? Will the minister table that?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of consistently good economic figures over the last 12 months is that the outlook now is for higher economic activity and employment, with lower inflation and a lower current account deficit.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised forecasts reflect the recent spate of good economic news that we have all read across a range of areas, including job vacancies, interest rates, employment, inflation, business and consumer confidence, and retail sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GDP growth is now expected to average 3.5 per cent in 1993-94, up from the forecast at budget time of 2.75 per cent. The rate of growth is well above almost every other OECD economy. In fact, while we are now talking about 3.5 per cent, the OECD economies were only at 1.1 per cent on average in 1993. The government is confident that we will see GDP growth of around four per cent during the next financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, on the employment front 116,000 jobs have already been created this financial year, exceeding the forecast made last budget time. We can now expect employment to grow by 200,000 jobs this financial year. It is evident that the improving consumer and business confidence in the economy is having the effect of attracting discouraged workers back to the work force, meaning that the participation rate increases, and unemployment will not be reduced greatly this year. This government has always taken the view that economic growth alone is not the way to deal with employment, and because of the problems of the long-term unemployed the government has embarked on a green paper to deal with policies in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth is underpinned also by the lowest inflation rate in 30 years. For the year as a whole, inflation will be around two per cent. Inflationary expectations are very low&mdash;the National Australia Bank survey suggests that 80 per cent of business believes that Australia can maintain an inflation rate below four per cent over the whole of the decade. Interest rates are at a 20-year low; international competitiveness is at its best level for 20 years; industrial disputes are at the lowest level since the mid-1960s; and productivity is increasing substantially. The current account deficit is also expected to be lower, coming in at four per cent of GDP rather than 4.25 per cent as previously forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures show faster recovery and greater growth at the leading level of the OECD at the same time as low inflation. The lift in business confidence, which has also continued to improve in recent surveys, augurs well for business investment, which is expected to continue to accelerate in 1993-94, with an even more rapid growth anticipated for 1994-95.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the last part of the question, there is nothing unique about the delegation that is made by ministers to their staff.

I checked the circumstances in which the cheque was paid, given that the authorisation was not formally recorded. My understanding is that for officeholders, government and opposition, the department's general operating premise has been that, if a form is signed by a senior office staff member of a minister or opposition officeholder properly authorised to exercise staff delegation, we have honoured it and acted in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New South Wales bushfires in January 1994 involved for the first time ever a truly national response to a bushfire situation. In addition to the magnificent assistance provided by the states and territories and by volunteers, the Commonwealth provided significant assistance through Emergency Management Australia, the Commonwealth agency charged with coordination of physical assistance in emergencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first official New South Wales request for Commonwealth assistance was made on 5 January and at that time Australian Defence Force elements had already been placed on stand-by to assist in anticipation of any request from New South Wales. Subsequent requests ranged in complexity from a new gearbox for an ex-army truck for use as a fire fighting appliance to all available ADF helicopters. The requests were met by the Australian Defence Force because no other Commonwealth department or agency has sufficient resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the height of the Commonwealth involvement there were more than 450 defence personnel actually on the fire grounds with appropriate and significant tanker, bulldozer and heavy plant support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HMAS Nirimba and RAAF Richmond base hospital were utilised as evacuation centres for hundreds of frail and disabled people who were evacuated from Sydney suburbs.

A RAAF Boeing 707 and Hercules aircraft transported more than 1,200 interstate firefighters and 12.5 tonnes of equipment to and from Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. In all, some 2,000 defence personnel were involved in assisting New South Wales. Other personnel and their equipment were on stand-by in case they were needed.

The issue that Senator Baume raised yesterday relates to the accounts for the company Brown and Hatton for the period 1990 to 1991. It was a proprietary company at the time those accounts were submitted. The return was submitted by the then director shareholders, Mr Brown and Mr Hatton, on the basis of its being a proprietary company. In fact, that was a technical error because, as has been readily acknowledged, for 11 months of that financial year the company was a public, but unlisted, company&mdash;with only two shareholders, true, but, nonetheless, technically a public unlisted company.</PARA>

There was no issue of public interest involved because at all relevant times the company had simply two shareholders and two directors&mdash;the same people. It was not, in any relevant sense, a matter of public interest that the accounts be written in any other way than the way they were. It was a technical error. It was corrected. Big deal!

However much we might like to be able to clear the air on this occasion, our position has to be that the Australian government simply will not comment on these substantive allegations. Might I say more generally, though, that a number of inquiries have, of course, reported on ASIS in recent years, and I have confidence in the present comprehensive arrangements for its oversight, including the establishment by the government of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</PARA></TALK.START>

Malaysian ministers have announced the retraction of all measures against Australia that were imposed during those difficulties. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The subsequent public assurance by Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, that there would be no residual impact on Australian companies was very encouraging.

Could the minister also explain why no development application or building application was carried out before the grant was awarded to the club? Is Maitland likely to retain the money now that it has been discovered that the development site of the club facilities is heavily contaminated with toxic tar? Given that Mrs Kelly has said that she discussed with her staff all 2,000 projects awarded grants without there being any paperwork, on what basis did she make her decision to award the grant to this cricket club, given that the project did not have a DA or a BA and is now unlikely to be approved by the Environmental Protection Authority or the local council?</PARA></TALK.START>

Given the number of cancers that can be caused, be they cancers of the lung, oral cavity, larynx, stomach&mdash;virtually everywhere&mdash;people must understand that they run risks. Australian evidence has not linked colon-rectal cancer to smoking, but there has been a study in the United States which claims to have established this connection. As far as I know there are two studies, involving more than 150,000 people, showing that cigarette smoking can lead to colon cancer in both men and women. The parallel studies to be published tomorrow in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of the National Cancer Institute</EMPHASIS> also found that early smoking apparently fixes for life the risk of colon-rectal cancer, even if the smoking habit is later dropped.</PARA></TALK.START>

Through the national drug strategy the Commonwealth government will continue to work with state and territory governments to reduce premature death and illness associated with tobacco use. It would be helpful if, in that process, the Victorian government were to at least honour the agreement that all states and the Commonwealth had come to earlier last year to have a national agreement on what can be advertised on cigarette packs.

In the first instance, we had Senator McMullan providing specific information and admitting that not only had Mr Lennox signed the contract, but that there was no written delegation of authority from Mr Griffiths. In other words, he was prepared to volunteer information without saying, somehow, that this should not be allowed to prejudice the police inquiries, or that in some other way it was not appropriate to disclose those facts. But then he refused to provide other factual information when requests were made; particularly when he was asked whether in fact Ms Harrison had signed a form.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is absolutely no justification or explanation for revealing some salient features but not others. In the circumstances I would hope that the minister will reconsider the untenable position that he has adopted and will decide that, having gone part of the way he ought, in justice to all parties concerned, ensure that all the information is on the table. For our part, we are not seeking to prejudge these matters. The minister by his actions has certainly allowed that to happen. The only way that the minister can clarify the position is to provide the answers to the questions that were properly put to him today. </PARA>

<PARA>The supplementary part of my question asked Senator Gareth Evans to give an unequivocal assurance that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), either as Treasurer or Prime Minister, had not been involved in any negotiations or dealings whatsoever&mdash;including with Danish government members or officials&mdash;in relation to the piggery project. That is a very simple question: has he or has he not as Treasurer or Prime Minister been involved other than at arm's length or as a passive investor?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the question is that Mr Constantinidis was the first person to publicly state that the Prime Minister was heavily involved in the operations of the company, at least to the extent of its negotiations with the Danes. We know that negotiations with the Danes went on for a very long time&mdash;in fact, longer than that for which the Prime Minister was on the back bench. That is on the record. So when Senator Evans tells the chamber that everyone knew that the Prime Minister was negotiating, he was in fact misleading this parliament because that is simply not true. At no stage was this parliament told, nor did it appear in print, that the Prime Minister was heavily involved during his period on the back bench in negotiations with the Danes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intriguing that neither the Prime Minister nor his ministers&mdash;nor his minions as they scurry up and down the press gallery, spreading poison and terrorising the gallery into not running any material about this issue&mdash;at any stage suggested that the Prime Minister's involvement with the business was other than at arm's length. Certainly, that was the impression that Senator Evans falsely presented today. Senator Evans responded that it was an arm's length exercise and always had been. He did not qualify that by adding that that was in terms of the accounts. In fact&mdash;to quote one of many examples&mdash;when asked about his pigs on radio 6WF in Perth on 30 June 1992, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mine is really just a passive investment.</PARA>
<PARA>It is either a passive investment or it is not. If at any stage he has been heavily involved in negotiations on behalf of this company, we are entitled to know that he did not really mean that it was only a passive investment but that it has been a very active investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all now starting to admit the absolute correctness of the bulk of the points I have been making&mdash;firstly, of course, about the accounts, a matter I have been pursuing for 99 per cent of my time since raising this matter in this place. They are admitting that there was an error, and they have been forced to admit that the Prime Minister has not at all times had an arm's length relationship with this company and at all times been a passive investor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked a simple question. That question is: in view of the fact that the Prime Minister is now known to have been involved in detailed, heavy negotiation with the Danes, will we get an unequivocal assurance that when he was Treasurer&mdash;in other words, when he first acquired his interest in this venture&mdash;or when he was Prime Minister, he was not involved in any such negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question hangs in the air: why should the Prime Minister enter into an investment in a company which was losing multimillions of dollars&mdash;that is, according to the correct accounts&mdash;unless he knew there was a prospect of some venture like the Danish one coming good? It was the only reason the company was worth that sort of investment. We want an assurance that he had not been involved in any undertakings. I wonder why Senator Evans refuses to give any. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of my colleague Senator Michael Baume. The question which was raised today&mdash;and I differ from the interpretation of the President on this&mdash;I thought was very straightforward and specific. I am sorry the President is not in the chair. I would like the President, if someone could bring it to his attention, to look very carefully at the question Senator Baume asked Senator Gareth Evans. It was a very specific question. It did not travel far and wide. Therefore it did not provide the room for Senator Evans to attempt to skate as he did. It was quite correct that points of order were taken against Senator Evans to try to get him to address the specific question. I ask that the President of the Senate, who made a ruling and a comment on Senator Baume's question,  look closely at it because I believe that the comment he made was not justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element is that a clear tactic is being adopted by Senator Evans. Every time Senator Baume speaks he cops an enormous tirade of abuse. Three years ago when we were new in the chamber and Senator Evans had been here a long time we were impressed by this tirade of abuse. We remember that every time my colleague Senator Campbell asked about Brian Burke, Senator Evans used to heap enormous amounts of abuse on Senator Campbell. That stopped when Brian Burke was charged, but Senator Evans was never prepared to inquire into the specific matters of the question and kept very clear of it. He resorted to the tactic of abuse. In relation to the Marshall Islands, the same tactic was adopted by Senator Evans. Specific questions were asked. Those who had the temerity to ask them always copped a verballing from him. I put it to Senator Evans and the chamber that we are getting the same tactic on some very valid questions about Mr Keating's business interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a long period the Labor Party has not been loath to question people on this side of the chamber about their business interests.

Where sensible and reasonable questions are being asked in this chamber we are entitled to sensible and moderate responses from Senator Evans. The point I wish to make is that we have seen this tactic of abuse before, when public interest and accountability demand some considered replies to the very valid and important questions Senator Baume was asking. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney this day, relating to the allocation of sports funding.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few months the sports rorts affair has unravelled more and more as cases have come to light around Australia of the absurd allocation of taxpayers' money to the extent of $30 million. There was the case in East Maitland of a cricket club which had as one of its main contenders Mr Tony Keating, who is an aspirant to the seat of Maitland. The sheer incompetence of the application put forward by his club is only now really coming out. The club had applied for the money for six years. One could ask why it was constantly knocked back for six years and why, suddenly, it was granted just before the last March election? It was obviously granted because it was part of Minister Kelly's pork-barrelling exercise around New South Wales, in particular in the marginal seats, Paterson being the most marginal of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer incompetence of the way in which this money was handed out is only now coming to light in the local newspapers. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> last week these headlines appeared: `Delay could cost big grant&mdash;Toxic tar fear hits cricketers'; `Contamination scare'; `Council may seek land test "compo"'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has come out of this&mdash;and it is particularly important in light of what Minister Kelly has just admitted about the paperwork, or lack of it, on this matter&mdash;is that, before $49,000 in public money was handed out, there was no testing at all of the worthiness of this proposal. All they had was an open ground, a ground that had formerly been a gas works site. What has now come to light is that there is an enormous amount of toxic tar on this site. Because of the delay caused by the environmental problems and the rather curious fact that there was no development application or building application, this has created terrific delays. It seems that what will happen is that Maitland will lose this money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon the minister, in a rather silly way, was trying to make out that it was good that Maitland had got the money. The whole point is that, as the headlines have said, the delay could cost the grant. Maitland will probably not get the money. We have had the absurd spectacle in the local region of Bob Horne, the local member, proudly boasting, `I will pork-barrel for my area. I will get anything I can for my area', which totally misses the point. The point is that we should try to get money for our area, but that money should go to worthwhile and sound projects that have gone through the proper procedures. Through the silly actions and sheer incompetence of Bob Horne and his staffer Tony Keating, the pretender for the seat of Maitland, they are going to lose a grant for this city. I challenge Mr Horne and Mr Keating to defend this action in light of the way they have incompetently handled this grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also challenge Minister Kelly to tell the parliament how much consideration she gave to this grant. Picture the scene: it is before the 1993 election. Everyone is rushing around electioneering. Two thousand applications for sports grants arrive on Minister Kelly's desk. Is she seriously asking the parliament to believe that she considered all these sports grants in detail? Is she seriously asking us to believe that she could even do that without any paperwork? It is blatantly obvious that without a DA, a BA and environmental approval there was no paperwork. I think this is yet another example of the incompetence of this government, this minister and local members in the Hunter Valley. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of these terms of reference the following points need to be kept under consideration. The first is the nature and purpose of the validation program.  As an audit program it plays two primary roles. The first is to ensure that $1.1 billion of the nursing home budget, which is provided specifically for nursing and personal care of residents, is expended in the provision of this care. The program also ensures the integrity of expenditure of taxpayers' funds and thus fulfils obligations within the framework of audit responsibilities placed on the Department by the Parliament and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.4<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is that the validation program is decentralised in its administration. Operating with 50 field staff working out of 8 State Offices in a complex area it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be some errors. Where there are complaints, these are examined and rectified. The number of complaints received by the Department, including those presented to the Committee, are not considered substantial for a program of this size and complexity. Nonetheless, the Government remains absolutely committed to the integrity of administration and fulfilling its commitments under the National Health Act, the Audit Act and under administrative law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.5<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there has been substantial improvement to the legislative base of the program. From December 1992 proprietors selling nursing homes must give 90 days notice to give the Department enough time to validate and for a financial settlement to be finalised prior to the completion of the sale. On 1 July 1993 debt recovery provisions came into effect. These provisions provide a mechanism for the vendor of a nursing home to provide for any liability to the Commonwealth out of the sale price of the home, which is held in trust while the validation is completed. These provisions also require the Department to complete validations within three years of the end of a financial year from 1993-94 onwards. In addition to these provisions, a bill is before Parliament that will enable recovery of monies owing to the Commonwealth from a vendor of a nursing home at time of sale for benefit paid in financial years prior to 1 July 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3.2 Retrospectivity and delays</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Committee Finding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found that "While retrospectivity is inevitable . . . it is possible that some validation processes have been delayed and that this is a concern and, possibly direct expense to the nursing home."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns about timeliness and retrospectivity are being addressed by accelerating the schedule of validations, completing 1986-87 validations by June 1994, and limiting time delay to three years. The provision of additional resources for validation in the 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 Budgets has allowed the backlog to be substantially reduced. Over the past three years, since the provision of additional resources, 2330 individual year validations have been completed covering 790 nursing homes and 8 financial years. Recoveries over the last three financial years have been $12.5m in 1990-91, $22m in 1991-92 and $20m in 1992-93.  During the period 1 July 1993 to 31 October 1993, $2.5m has been recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless it is not the case that time delays have caused financial loss to proprietors. Nursing homes have had the use of the funds on an interest free basis for a significant period of time. This would be to the financial advantage of nursing homes rather than be a direct expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, claims of retrospective policy making results from the nature of the funding system that was initially established with CAM expenditure being defined on the basis of first principle. This first principle was clear and agreed between the Department and the industry organisations. The flexibility inherent in this approach allows some proprietors to test the limits of this flexibility by claiming that staff performing SAM duties were performing nursing and personal care duties. This leads to conflict because there is a strong profit motive for infrastructure or SAM costs to be claimed against care funding, or CAM. Under the legislation the Department has no option but to reject such duties, when claimed as CAM.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that "Matters being investigated by the Ombudsman may include issues of appeals against administrative decisions, the operation of natural justice . . . and other matters not directly related to validation decision such as decisions regarding funding that are not appealable."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program is administered under specific and comprehensive legislation. Should instances of denial of natural justice and lack of appeal rights be identified, then the  legislation will need appropriate amendment by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Committee should note that the recent amendments to the National Health Act have clear appeal provision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and also that a legislative review that is currently being undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Law Reform Commission will specifically address the issue of appeal rights.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While good record keeping should be encouraged, this understates the concern that an incentive could be created for records to be mislaid where they show costs lower than that which would be allowed as a "reasonable cost".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases attempts have been made to recreate the records of a nursing home where these have been lost or destroyed. In such situations it is important to ensure that the funds were expended and the funds were necessarily expended in providing resident care.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Australian Bureau of Statistics employ an agreed set of definitions for statistics related to the tourism industry, and particularly seek a correlation between the ABS accommodation data and the data in the BTR's International Visitor Survey and the Domestic Tourism Monitor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Accept</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS is developing a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Framework for Tourism Statistics for Australia</EMPHASIS> to apply common concepts and definitions to the collection and publication of tourism statistics. The ABS is also developing an Australian Standard Classification of Visitor Accommodation. The BTR is cooperating with the ABS in both these exercises.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That the ABS urge all collectors of tourism statistics to collect all data under the guidelines of the ABS Framework so as to allow the ABS to produce a standardised and comprehensive Directory of Tourism Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Accept</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS produced a draft of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Framework </EMPHASIS>in 1991 and has subsequently widely promoted its use. Upon its finalisation the ABS will encourage all statistical collectors to adopt standard methodologies, which will be reflected in the entries in future editions of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Directory of Tourism Statistics.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3:</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That the BTR canvass with government authorities, practising economists and academics alternative economic models for net benefit analysis, and that the BTR be provided with additional resources to allow it to carry out additional research functions.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Under consideration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A study of alternative economic models for net benefit analysis is consistent with both the BTR charter and its future priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A formal evaluation of the BTR was conducted in 1991-92 and this identified a number of priority areas for further activity by the BTR and the appropriate resource requirements. Since that time there has been some augmentation of BTR resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, an initiative announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will assess net benefit aspects of inbound tourism.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Accept</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The BTR conducted a Domestic Tourism Expenditure Survey during 1992. This will supply improved information for studying the economic impacts of domestic tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step in the analysis of the data, the BTR has commissioned an input-output study, which is due for completion by the end of January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ORANI modelling work has been carried out and further work using the updated data is planned, but timing will depend on funding and competing priorities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding position for the ATC has changed significantly since 1986-87. Government funding of the ATC has increased by over 150% to $77.817 million in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government encourages the ATC to supplement its appropriation by seeking tourism industry contributions to its international marketing programs. In 1993-94, $25.117 million is expected to be raised from State/Territory and industry sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's review of the contribution of tourism to the economy, announced in the 1993-94 Budget, will examine issues associated with both public and private sector funding of international tourism promotion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That an investigation be carried out by the Tourism Ministers' Council into State and Federal overseas tourism representation to evaluate whether the most cost-effective arrangements are in place, or whether a rationalisation is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Reject</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94 the Commonwealth Government provided $2 million to the ATC to supplement funding for "Partnership Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Partnership Australia" aims to better coordinate and channel the combined resources of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to exert a more concentrated and effective influence on overseas marketing. To achieve this, the ATC has invited the States and Territories to cooperatively undertake specific marketing activities overseas under the banner of "Partnership Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">That a review of the Australian Tourist Commission's promotion and marketing be carried out to identify a program which will encourage international tourism to all Australian States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Position: Under consideration</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before the siren sounded for lunch, I was making some comments on the proposals before the chamber. In the overall package we are, over a fortnight, increasing the number of hours that the Senate sits by roughly an hour and 10 minutes. So the overall changes do not increase to any great extent the actual hours that the Senate sits. The major changes relate to restrictions on the capacity of non-government senators to raise matters of concern. In other words, in the reordering of business that has occurred the government has come out, in terms of its program, a clear winner and the opposition has had restrictions placed on the times during which it has the capacity to raise issues of concern and its priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that we have seen this. In recent years, while I have been a member of the chamber, there has been a long succession of restrictions placed on the capacity of non-government senators to raise matters of concern. Senator Woodley would remember the debate that we had on reducing speeches during second reading stage debates from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We have had fewer questions in question time compared with what happened under previous governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been very extensive use of the guillotine in this chamber to put bills through. The statistics on that are most interesting and I am happy to bring them to Senator Woodley's attention. This government has been prepared to use the guillotine far more than previous governments. The statistics are quite extraordinary. The reality is that, in this chamber, the government can use that procedure only with the support, typically, of the minor parties. I think that is a pity. The willingness to use the guillotine has encouraged the government to bunch its program towards the end of the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is accurate to say there have been fewer sitting days. There has been a change&mdash;to the great advantage of government&mdash;to restrict the size of quorums. That again was supported by the minor parties. Quorums are sometimes a useful procedure in controlling and disciplining this chamber, and both parties have used them. Unfortunately, as a result of the change to quorum procedures there is less pressure on the government. In recent years restrictions have been imposed on the taking note of answers to questions and a time limit imposed. That is a pity because that was one of the more constructive procedures in this chamber. There has been a reduction in the number of legislative standing committees. That, again, is clearly to the advantage of the government and again it restricts the capacity of non-government senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I do not say that there have not been a few gains, but I believe there has been a tendency, where a procedure is being used effectively, for the government to start to feel the pressure. Regrettably, on a number of occasions some non-government senators in the minor parties have decided to support the government position rather than the position that I think is appropriate in this chamber,  where governments are made more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, these arrangements will come in. I am doubtful whether the arrangements will produce a saving in time. Already in the debate today there has been a lot of discussion to the effect that when we get up at eight in the evening there will be a chance for committees to hold meetings. It is unlikely that those meetings will last just a few short minutes. So I think we will find that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we will have more contact with our families; I think we will be in the parliament earlier and conscientious senators, at least, will be here later. Senator Herron may well differ from me on this matter, but I suspect that the majority of senators will ensure that less time is spent here. I am a parliamentarian who believes we are elected by the people to come here; they want us to work, and to work hard&mdash;they expect that from us. I think the previous arrangements worked quite well but I accept that the numbers are against us and there will be these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final message I would like to give is that it seems to me that a philosophical issue is emerging here. What is the appropriate philosophy for this sort of chamber? As we constantly say, it is a chamber which makes governments accountable and reviews their actions. Inevitably, that is a bit unpleasant for the government. To my mind the Australian Democrats seem to fluctuate in their philosophy by trying to get onside with the government and work with the government. Of course, once they are part of the governmental process, as they will be in the course of the budget, the accountability process in this chamber is compromised. That is a decision that Senator Woodley and his colleagues will have to make. To a certain extent one becomes another part of the government and it means that the ability of making governments more accountable to this chamber is eroded. That is a philosophical issue Senator Woodley's party will have to debate internally and decide what course to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often say that Don Chipp had the view that the philosophy of the Democrats was to keep governments honest, to keep us all honest and, hopefully, even to keep the Democrats honest. That was not a bad philosophy. It is a pity that on a number of occasions the Democrats have not joined with us in our attempts to keep the government honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important debate. Important changes are coming forward. The particular change I am opposed to relates to the adjournment motion. It would be a pity to reduce the existing flexibility in that area. It means that the capacity to bring forward important issues which may occur once or twice a session, when a senator wants to come in and land the government with a particular problem&mdash;maybe on its side; maybe on our side&mdash;will be greatly restricted. That is a pity but I am sure we will learn to live with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see any advantage for the Australian Democrats in supporting the government on this issue. I listened very carefully to Senator Bourne. Senator Woodley may also make a contribution, and I will listen carefully to him. But I cannot see the advantage in non-government senators supporting arrangements which reduce their capacity to question the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today it was interesting to see that a number of Senator Woodley's colleagues kept focusing on the points of order taken. I cannot remember his colleagues ever raising questions about the relevance of an answer which has been given. One of the reasons we on this side take points of order is that the government refuses to answer the questions we put to it. I think it shows the focus of some of Senator Woodley's colleagues. They focus more on the points of order. Typically, 90 per cent of points of order are on the issue of relevance&mdash;an attempt to get the government to address the question. It would be interesting to hear an interjection by Senator Woodley's colleagues that urged the government to answer the question which has been put to it. I think that is an important issue. Again, it is part of this issue of making governments more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I think these changes significantly restrict in a number of important ways the ability of non-government senators to raise their issues of concern. I hope that, as we work through these arrangements, some of these effects can be moderated by the amendments that my colleague Senator Hill has moved. Because the amendments are very reasonable, sensible and, in some areas, to the considerable advantage of the minor parties, I hope that we will receive the Democrats' support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak only briefly to make some comments on these proposed new sitting hours and sitting arrangements which, if adopted, will see the Senate sit more days this year but go onto the adjournment debate at 7.20 p.m. and rise by 8 p.m. I believe that the only reason that these proposed new sitting hours have been brought about is that the sitting hours that have been set down in procedures for the Senate to abide by, certainly since the time that I have been here, have not been abided by, so we have had late sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the help of the Australian Democrats and minor parties, the government has negated the adjournment whenever it has suited it. So, instead of finishing at 10.30 p.m.&mdash;the hour set out in the hours of sitting for three days of the week&mdash;the government, with the help of the Democrats, has made us sit until all hours of the morning. If we had stopped at 10.30 p.m., which is the hour set down in the procedures and standing orders, a lot of the issues that have been raised, particularly those raised by my colleague Senator Herron, would not have arisen. Senator Herron has spoken many times&mdash;usually after midnight&mdash;about stress on both staff and senators. His arguments have been valid, but they have been valid only because the government, aided by the Democrats, has negated the adjournment. Therefore, the sitting hours that are laid down in the standing orders have not been abided by. Stress has been placed on both staff and senators in this place purely because the hours that have been set out have not been abided by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the reasoning behind lessening the number of hours that we sit each day. The idea is that we spread the work more evenly over more days and that we get home earlier every night. For many people this may be the case, particularly for senators and staff who live in Canberra. They will no doubt welcome the opportunity to leave here at what they might think to be the far more sensible hour of 8.00 p.m. and perhaps go home to their families or go home to have dinner. I think they are being misled if they think they are going to leave here at 8 o'clock. That is another point, but I can understand why they would welcome these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it seems to me that we are forgetting several very important matters. Firstly, the Senate's rising at 8.00 p.m. will not mean that we will have the chance to go home at that time. Honourable senators have spoken about estimates committees and other committee hearings taking place from 8.00 p.m. onwards. In many cases that will mean that staff, including many Parliament House staff, will be required to stay on; so people who think that we will stop at 8.00 p.m. have another think coming to them. If we adopt this new sitting program in its entirety we will do away with a formal dinner break and we will be in a worse position than we are in now. Currently the situation is that in most cases senators, and in many cases also their staff, have a rushed lunch&mdash;they grab a sandwich or something else that they can have on the run&mdash;if they have one at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this proposed procedure is passed we will not be able to guarantee a dinner break for ourselves, our staff or the Parliament House staff. I am quite sure that many senators and their staff will still be working here at 10.00 p.m. and later. I believe the proposed procedures will have the opposite effect upon the matters which Senator Herron and others have expressed concern. If people who work here do not stop for a formal dinner break they will be even more tired and stressed than usual because they will not have a chance to have a break away from work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne spoke at length about senators being macho by having very late sittings, and about people working 12-hour days. I do not think that anybody who comes here expects to work the same sorts of hours as people who work in nine to five jobs outside parliament because it is just not feasible or possible. No other job drags people from all over Australia to meet here. The idea is to get the maximum amount of work done while we are here. The evening meal break is an important time for senators, their staff, and other Parliament House staff to have time out. They can sit down, eat a meal, meet with colleagues and with staff from other offices. I understand that staff find out the most interesting things during the dinner break. I am quite sure that they, as well as many senators, would miss the opportunity to have this time out to sit and talk with their colleagues and other workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doing away with a formal dinner break will give us even less opportunity than we and our staff have now to get out of our offices. I think particularly of the staff involved in the whips' offices. My colleague Senator Teague said that a whip's office could have a replacement person or have a roster system so that somebody could work during the time when the whip's clerk had time off. I know that our whip's clerk can quickly tell us what business is before the chamber and how quickly she can contact people to let them know what is happening. It would be an impossible position for her, and other staff like her, in their offices. This building is not designed for much social interaction. Everybody seems to be hidden away in hermetically sealed offices with very little contact, and particularly at staff level there is very little contact with other staff. The one real chance that people have to get out and mix with others is during the formal dinner break from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to do away with that formal break for four days of the week would be very detrimental to staff and other people who work here. It is even more important for backbenchers' staff because in most cases there is only one staff member for each backbencher. In ministers' offices, the numerous staff can be rostered. Even if there were not a dinner break it would not have much effect because even now those staff members roster themselves for meal breaks. In the case of backbenchers, with one staff member only, that staff member usually has only a short lunch break or none at all. If these changes to procedures are passed then those staff members will not have a dinner break either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for my colleague Senator Teague to say that they should have everything organised from 10 minutes to seven at night; if there are other things going on that night, we are still asking one staff person in an office to work for enormously long hours without a break and under constant stress. That is notwithstanding the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff. I wonder whether anybody has taken the feelings of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking our single staff members to come to work in the morning and rush out to grab a sandwich at lunchtime. Now we will be asking them to rush out if they are hungry, tired or in need of a break and grab a snack to tide them over until 8 o'clock. This is assuming that our staff can leave at 8 o'clock. What happens if we have committee meetings and we ask them to work after 8 o'clock? When are they supposed to eat and where are they supposed to eat? Currently the staff canteen shuts at 8 o'clock anyway. I guess it means that Aussie's will be doing a booming trade. It might be at the expense of our waistlines. If we were all at risk of dying of heart attacks because of the previous sitting hours, I wonder whether we might be just as much at risk now if we start filling ourselves up on the run with sandwiches or food that we may not normally eat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that there is merit in these proposed sitting hours for the people who live in Canberra and who can actually leave at 8 o'clock&mdash;they can go home at a reasonable hour and see their families&mdash;but for senators and staff from interstate, there is no home to go to. Quite frankly, I would rather have a decent dinner break from 6.30 to 8 o'clock and then sit until 10 o'clock or 10.30, because I will not go home any earlier if the Senate rises at 8 o'clock. I will have either committee work or other work which could go much later than 10.00 p.m. After 8 o'clock I would have to have dinner here or go out and have a meal somewhere else, at a restaurant perhaps. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff who travel with us are in a very similar position. Why would they want to go home to a motel room or their accommodation at 8 o'clock at night? If they have come this far to work while we are here, we are better off putting the time into the work that we are meant to be doing. My feeling has always been that when I leave my family and home to come here, I would rather make use of every available hour here on work and get it over and done with, rather than spend extra time and more days away from my home and family. If I am here, I would rather be working than stopping at 8 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, despite the good intentions, I think that we and our staff will work much the same hours that we work now. The difference will be that there is likely to be more stress because we have eaten dinner on the run, not eaten at all or we end up overindulging at a restaurant late at night. It appears to me that the new sitting hours were devised by people who have more than one staff member or people who live in Canberra and have homes to go to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from any other concerns that I have on my own behalf, I simply do not think it is fair on backbenchers' staff and other staff who are in an office by themselves. Despite the occupational health and safety rules saying that all staff must take at least a half an hour break for dinner, the pressure will be on them to wait until at least 7.20 p.m. when adjournment speeches begin or 8 o'clock when the house rises, or else have no dinner at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are staff who will simply have no choice at all. If they are the only employee over here, they are the only person able to do the job and they will be unable to leave their office until 7.20 p.m., if not 8 o'clock. I understand from speaking to some of the staff members I know that they are none too impressed about the proposed sitting hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two possible solutions for staff if these procedures go through. If the Senate is to rise at 8.00 p.m., then a full service must be made available at the staff canteen for at least an hour after we rise for interstate staff who are unable to go home for dinner. Alternatively, if a full service is not possible because of the reduced numbers, we need to consider their circumstances. It is all right for us as senators. We have access to transport in order to go out for dinner and to get home afterwards, but our staff do not all have that same entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the staff canteen does not offer a full service for a reasonable time after 8.00 p.m., I do not think it is fair on the staff who come here to pay their own way to a restaurant for a decent meal and then pay their own way to their accommodation. If we cannot provide a proper meal service in Parliament House for the staff who come here from interstate, then we must come up with an acceptable alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Teague is correct that there will be no requirement for staff backup from 10 minutes to seven on Tuesdays and Thursdays when government documents are under discussion, then I suggest that a formal dinner break ought to be declared for staff from 10 minutes to seven until 20 minutes past eight. This will give them time to have a formalised dinner break and these would then be the hours when the canteen should offer a full service. If committee meetings are to be held at night, they should not start until 8.30 p.m. Of the two alternatives, the second is the preferable by far, and I hope that senators will give it some consideration if, as I anticipate, these proposals are passed with the support of the Democrats and many of the sensible amendments proposed by Senator Hill are rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that these procedures were devised by senators who have only one staff member. They certainly were not devised by staff who are unable to leave their offices for dinner until 7.20 p.m. or 8.00 p.m. and they certainly were not proposed by staff who come here from interstate. They were not designed by any normal person who gets hungry well before 8 o'clock and does not work as well on an empty stomach. I do not know what my colleague Senator Herron would think about people who eat meals late every night. Sometimes when people wait a long time to eat, they tend to eat somewhat more than they should. These procedures certainly were not devised by senators like me who do not like being apart from our families as much as we are at present&mdash;let alone adding every Monday to the sitting schedule&mdash;and not making full use of the time when we are here. That is the most important and compelling argument of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have people who are drawn from all around Australia and from every state. We bring people to Canberra, which is an expensive exercise. I believe that every available hour should be used in the work of the parliament and Senate chamber so that the population of Australia gets value for its money, although some will always question whether they are getting value for their money. We should attempt to use every available hour we are here without going to ridiculous extremes. Those ridiculous extremes would never have been reached if the Democrats had not supported the government in negating the adjournment every time we reached 10.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposed new rules say that we will rise at 8 o'clock without the motion being put for the adjournment and I wonder just what will happen if we have a situation like we had at the end of last year. I wonder how early the Democrats will decide that they will support the government in guillotining legislation through which will restrict debate. We will have a similar situation to the one in the lower house where, on some occasions, there is no debate at all for important bills. I wonder where the Democrats would stand on such an issue, because when it came to negating the adjournment that was when the extra time that was considered to be required was made up. If that is no longer possible, how early in the session and how early in a debate on legislation will the Democrats support the government in applying the guillotine to important legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has come up with what I think are reasonable amendments which deal with some specific areas. The amendment I wish to refer to particularly is the one in relation to the adjournment debate. I support my colleague Senator Kemp, because Senator Bourne gave us the figures showing that the average time in the budget session for speaking on the adjournment debate was 22 minutes. Why would there be any need to put a time limit of 40 minutes on the adjournment debate when the average is 22 minutes? If convention is observed, we would scarcely ever go over the proposed time limit anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting the 10-minute limit on individual speakers allows the government to prevent opposition backbenchers from raising important issues. All the government has to do is bring in a couple of senators to speak for 10 minutes, have a Democrat speak for 10 minutes, and then there may be a chance for two opposition senators to raise an issue of substance during the adjournment debate and speak on it for only 10 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate relating to speeches on the motion for the second reading, I listened to Senator Bell speak long and loud on the importance of restricting the debate to 20 minutes, and on the same night he spoke for 28 minutes on the adjournment debate.

That was a reaction to exhaustion. Nobody knew the figures; nobody had any idea of the millions of dollars involved. That is the sort of thing to which I am referring. If any more evidence is required, observe what occurs in this chamber as the time progresses past 8.00 p.m. or 9.00 p.m. and the irrational behaviour of senators after midnight, particularly towards the end of the week.

I am not a member of the Procedure Committee, but Senator Bourne indicated that the committee drew the line there and then worked backwards. It is not just the senators who are affected by this; it is the clerks and the staff.

We have to stay here because division bells ring or quorums are required; we cannot leave the place. Like boarding school, we have to be paired to get out of the place. Under the proposed procedures, after 8.00 p.m. the choice is there. Senators can have as many committee meetings as they like&mdash;I will not be there. They can do what they like in that regard, if that is what they want. They can put a committee meeting on every night from 8.00 p.m. till 3.00 a.m.&mdash;be the guest of those who wish to do it.

The opposition amendments have canvassed some of those potential problems.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not certain whether the statement that parliamentary sitting hours have been set by the train timetables 50 years ago was accurate. I checked with the clerk&mdash;who had not heard this one&mdash;who further enlightened me as to the rationale of the present situation. Apparently, at a time when members of parliament were mainly professional and business gentlemen, who enacted their parliamentary responsibilities in their leisure hours, it was customary for them to be part time and for them to engage in the responsibilities of the parliament in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could have been true up to 25 years ago when this chamber never sat until the afternoon. Gradually the mornings have been adopted because, as we would all know, becoming a member of parliament is certainly a full-time occupation rather than a part-time extracurricular activity. As a consequence, we have not really adapted to the reality of the lifestyle or the time in which we live. For a long time Senator Herron and Senator Teague have bemoaned the severe effects on the physical and mental health of not only senators and their immediate staff but all the staff associated with the workings of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the community have little idea of the hours of hard work that are involved in the political arena with regard to parliamentary representation and decision making. When people do become aware, via the media, of the ridiculous pressures that lead to all night sittings and early morning rises, they are appalled at the inappropriate example that we reflect to the community. Senator Herron raised the idea of legislation by exhaustion and I believe it is a very valid one. It gives the worst possible picture to the community of what our priorities are. We are seen in the community with our electoral responsibilities, but when we are debating in this place the public sees us making important decisions in a very rushed and harassed way at outrageous hours. Sometimes stern measures have to be adopted towards that, and the guillotine is one of them. The decisions that we make uphold the true significance and responsibility&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to finish this and get on to the point that Senator Panizza is making about adjournments. The decisions that we make uphold the true significance and responsibility for the legislation that we debate, and this should demand that we do it in the clear light of day and without pressure, and without the slur that can be placed on us if we are in a position of considering it at all hours and in all kinds of ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, I support in principle the recommendations that are before us, but there are some aspects that I believe warrant consideration. The major matter concerns the curtailment of the adjournment debate which will deprive senators of legitimate opportunities for expressing matters that have not arisen at other points in the parliamentary program, and which may relate to electoral concerns and community matters. When there is a rigid timetable there is always a danger that, instead of its giving us increasing leisure and freedom, it actually constrains us so that the time allocated tends to be filled up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that I feel about the curtailment of the adjournment debate is that the program is being driven to a certain extent by a desire for certainty. Who can blame senators, or members for that matter, who would like to have certainty on a Thursday about whether they can catch a plane at nine o'clock at night to return to their families? I believe we should respect that and provide for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am concerned that constraining all four days, with increasing competition for that time, may deprive certain senators of the freedom of speech and also lead to an overuse of the adjournment debate. Ironically, as Senator Baume pointed out, all the time allocations made by the Procedure Committee have taken into full consideration the practice that we have engaged in over the past year. In that time we had total freedom&mdash;maybe not total freedom, but certainly considerably more freedom than this program allows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger is that when we are offered more than we were using when we had that freedom, we will suddenly demand it all and some people will get lost in the running for the time that is available. The Greens are proposing a trial period until the Easter break. On Mondays we will continue with the unlimited practice of the adjournment, as we have had it to the present, and only have the timetabled adjournments with the 10 minutes restriction and the 40 minutes time limit for the remaining three days. I believe that this will be a way of assessing whether it is required and whether the constraints of this new program are too severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that Senator Ferguson is correct when he says that this process would not be abused if we had it for all four days. One good way of testing that is to see whether the practice leads to genuine discipline being applied, or whether it will lead to concerns that the system is being abused on the one day when it is available. I will be circulating the amendment in the chamber. It allows a trial period for one day a week&mdash;and that day is Monday&mdash;when we will put the question for the adjournment at 7.20, but the same constraints that will apply to the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday timetable will not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether this proves to be a success or not, we will have some time to make changes. It is an attempt to see whether we need it or not. If the Senate does not consider it worthy of being maintained, we will go back to the recommendations of the Procedure Committee automatically on 3 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second concern has already been raised and there has been some lengthy discussion on it. It is to be found in the opposition's 11th amendment, and it refers to general business not commencing later than 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays in order not to curtail the opportunities we may have to discuss general business, and opposition, independent, Democrat and Green business. The Greens will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a review of this intended program at the end of this year. This is appropriate because any timetable which we are trialing deserves to be tested under the conditions of the different sittings of the year. While that review will occur after one year, I believe that there is a requirement for some monitoring along the way. The appropriate committee to be engaged in that monitoring process is the Procedure Committee, which has put all these recommendations to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occupational health and safety issues have implications not only for senators and their immediate staff, but also for the clerks, clerical staff, attendants and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporting staff. Their present awards and work practices have evolved under the old sitting patterns and times. It may be necessary for those awards and work practices to be altered in light of the changes that we are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not only an industrial issue. We must not lose sight of the personal and social impacts. I hope that, at the appropriate time, the Procedure Committee will look at these issues. If it has not done that within a reasonable period&mdash;say, within three to six months&mdash;I will take steps to ensure that there is a review to ascertain the detrimental or positive effects of the changes that we are voting on today and which the Greens support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that we changed our routines and hours of sitting. A one-year trial period before changing standing orders is appropriate because we need to establish whether the proposed new arrangements are more appropriate at certain times of the year than at others. However, no matter what changes we make, the exercise will require goodwill on all sides of the chamber. It is possible to abuse freedom and, to a certain extent, that is what has happened over the years. It has meant that there has not always been certainty over the number of hours available for government business. Sometimes it has meant that individual senators have not been able to express legitimate concerns or raise certain issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to congratulate those who have made contributions to this debate and to the development of the proposals contained in the report of the Procedure Committee. Among them, of course, is Senator Herron. Being a medico, he was aware of the problems manifesting themselves amongst honourable senators as a result of the extended periods and unusual hours that we were sitting. It is heartening for me to see that there is an intention all round to do something about the situation and to get some sanity into the system, not only for ourselves but also, and perhaps more particularly, for the people other than senators and members who work in this parliament&mdash;not that I am suggesting that we do not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, I support the recommendations of the report in principle. Those recommendations are now contained in the proposal moved by Senator Faulkner. I listened very carefully to what was said by Senator Hill on this point, and I am concerned to ensure that the functions of the members of the Senate&mdash;those of review and scrutiny&mdash;should be preserved. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also listened to the responses from Senator Teague and others to the matters raised in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that three matters need to be considered against the one particular requirement that we all insist upon&mdash;certainly, I do and the opposition does&mdash;and that is our power to scrutinise. Senator Hill questioned the ability of the parliament to discuss government documents in a relevant and timely fashion. Government documents will be considered but a question of time is involved. As I understand it, the new provisions deduct 30 minutes from the time presently allotted for the consideration of government documents. I am not sure that that is necessarily a good idea and perhaps some further thought could be given to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am not wedded to the amendments put forward by Senator Hill which would change the order in which government documents are to be considered. While honourable senators can obtain government documents, and presumably make press statements about them, that does not discharge our function because our function is primarily discharged in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that was given some consideration was the ability of senators to raise issues on the adjournment. This is particularly important when it comes to constituency matters. There is a limitation on the time available to honourable senators for this purpose. However, as has been pointed out, the recommendations have taken into account the average time that has been utilised for that purpose in the past. I would like to see a safety valve in place on one night&mdash;I made an interjection on this point during one of the earlier contributions&mdash;and Senator Chamarette's suggestion that it be on Monday evenings seems to me to be an appropriate one, and at this stage I would be prepared to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that was raised is very important. It was raised by Senator Hill and related to question time. Senator Hill moved amendment No. 12, which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions may be put to Ministers each day until 28 questions, including supplementary questions, have been asked and answered.</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly support that, particularly after the last two days. I will not go any further into it just at present, but I very strongly support that proposition. It is not an unattainable goal to have 28 questions, including supplementaries, asked. That has occurred in the past. I am indebted to Senator Kemp for the document he gave us. In 1980 and 1981 the average number of questions daily, including supplementaries, was 28 and 29. It was 26.3 in 1982 and 23.4 in 1983. Now it is down to an average of 22.5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, all of us have seen the tendency for ministers to make statements to the parliament which should be made at another time. If a matter is important it should be introduced as a ministerial statement but, quite frequently, government senators ask ministers dorothy dixers. In my view, in question time ministers should be put on their mettle by this parliament and information which is of public interest should be obtained from them. One of the most important times for this to occur is at question time. It is not being done if question time is used simply as a means of allowing ministers to get on their pet hobby horses with members of the government asking them bland questions to which bland responses are made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to thank honourable senators who contributed to this debate for their constructive contributions. We have certainly had those from right around the chamber, including the opposition. I single out Senator Herron and Senator Teague, who made some suggestions which are worthy of examination in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to correct the misapprehension of some members of the opposition that the Australian Democrats appear to share a great deal of the responsibility for the negation of adjournments. In fact, it is fair to say that this was done during the last budget session as a result of informal arrangements made with all parties, including the opposition. That is true of course of most of the procedural arrangements that we make in this chamber. Any examination by honourable senators would show that a very significant number of the negations of the adjournment were done on the voices at 10.30 p.m. In fact, that occurred on 13 out of the 39 sitting days during the budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major point made by the opposition in this debate was some extraordinary suggestion that it was the opposition that was making all the sacrifices and the government making none with this new routine of business and times and dates of sittings. That is simply not true. The average time available for government business in the past has been a minimum of 12 hours a week, increased only by negations of the adjournment. This new proposal would provide about 11 hours a week, on the assumption that there would be no more than one MPI a week. This would be only one-third of the total time available with this new routine of business, not the two-thirds that has been claimed by opposition senators in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government business is the only item of business which has an open-ended start and no fixed duration under these proposals. I suppose, if there were daily matters of public importance, urgency motions, suspensions of standing orders, or lengthy debate on delegation reports or Auditor-General reports, we could find very little time for government business. That is always possible. Any system is open to abuse. We have to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think it is fair to say that if senators adopt an appropriate spirit about these new procedures we should be able to see achieved a regular amount of government business dealt with consistently across a session from week one through to the end of a session because there is clearly time available for that in the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question about the amount of time for government business is a concern that the government genuinely holds about these new arrangements, but in the interests of senators, senators' staff and staff of this parliament, we are willing to give these proposals a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague made a fair point in this debate when he questioned whether we should consider the debating of legislation as exclusively government time. After all, I have noticed that more opposition senators speak in second reading debates than do government senators, and their interests are served during the committee stage of a bill. It is primarily opposition, independent and minor party senators who speak during those debates. Guaranteed time for debate of legislation is in the interest of not only the government but all senators in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another furphy that has been raised is this question of there not being enough time for committee reports, government documents and the adjournment debate. I was convinced by the very telling statistics that Senator Bourne provided during the debate. They indicate that, on average, there will be more time available than has been needed in the past for committee reports, government documents and the adjournment debate. In fact, I am surprised that Senator Bourne did not mount a strong case to say that we were being far too generous with this new routine of business in that area. The same point does not apply to the amount of time available for government business. So it is, in fact, the government that is sacrificing time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp made a valid point in the debate that what the non-government parties are sacrificing is the flexibility that they had previously to speak for however long they wanted in some areas. That is true. No-one is going to deny that that is one impact. But it is part of the sacrifices that are being made by all senators in developing a compromise that has been reached through a process of consensus that unfortunately has broken down only at the last hurdle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment that there are no meal breaks can be dealt with fairly quickly. I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of senators, other staff supervisors and those in positions of responsibility here in the parliament to organise some sort of appropriate rostering arrangements to ensure that staff in senators' offices and of the parliament do have appropriate meal breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the question of the lunchtime debates, traditionally very few senators have been involved in those debates, but it has been an opportunity that many have utilised. As Senator Bourne indicated in her contribution, there is clearly a need for that to continue because that time has been well spent by many senators. Traditionally, of course, on Thursdays we have sat through lunchtime and that has not caused enormous concern in the chamber previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the opposition amendments, the government is not planning to go to the barricades on amendment No. 11, which will have the effect of ensuring that general business will always run for the full two and a half hours on a Thursday afternoon. The same logic is not being applied by the opposition to government business in this particular routine of business. There is no suggestion from the opposition that government business begin at a certain inviolable time and nothing can be changed. Perhaps that is not where the opposition's interests lie, so I will resist the temptation of making that particular point in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder of the amendments that have been moved by Senator Hill would, frankly, just have the effect of gutting this proposal. They would radically alter the proposals that have come forward from the Procedure Committee. They would destroy the very delicate compromise that Senator Bourne, Senator Teague and I worked so assiduously to develop through the processes of the Procedure Committee. There is no doubt those amendments would reduce the amount of time available for government business to a ludicrous, totally unacceptable and totally unworkable level. As a result, after giving the amendments due consideration, the government will not be supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not enthusiastic about Senator Chamarette's amendment, which relates to an open-ended adjournment debate on one day a week for a limited period. I think there are arguments that can be mounted, as the Procedure Committee did, to have a consistent finishing time, but I will not be going to the barricades on that. I accept that there is a likelihood that, as Senator Harradine, Senator Bourne and Senator Chamarette have indicated, there is an attraction in that particular proposition. I stress again that these are significant reforms for the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a significant package of reforms. It is a genuine and sincere attempt on the part of the Procedure Committee to deal with the impact that the times of Senate sittings have had upon senators and staff and upon the families of senators and staff.

Amendments Nos 2 to 4 concern extending the adjournment and extending rights for individual speeches. Amendments Nos 5, 14, 15 and 16 are my amendments to allow committee reports on any day. Amendments Nos 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13 are those allowing debate on government documents every day. Amendments Nos 8 and 17 are those relating to matters of public interest on Thursday. Amendment No. 11 is the general business starting times amendment. Amendment No. 12 relates to the minimum number of questions. Amendment No. 18 removes the limit on MPIs and matters of urgency and substitutes, first, the right to move motions to take note of answers and, second, the trade-off between MPIs, urgencies and motions to take note of answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;My clear intention was to split the amendment moved by Senator Hill into two parts so that (7)(a) would be voted upon separately from the other part, the other part relating to the omission of paragraph (7). It was my intention that that was to be additional to paragraph (7). It was not my intention to enable what otherwise would occur. Paragraph (7) of Senator Faulkner's motion says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Debate on a matter of public importance or urgency motion under standing order 75 shall not exceed one hour, or, if no motions are moved after question time to take note of answers, 90 minutes, and a Senator shall not speak to such a matter or motion for more than 10 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, if that were deleted, then there would be no limit to the amount of time that could be spent debating a matter of public importance or an urgency matter. As I read it, on the hop, that could wipe out any other business for that day. </PARA>

I wanted to ensure that there is of right what occurs at the present moment; that is, that immediately after question time, on any of the days, a motion may be moved to take note of answers given to questions without notice. That is entrenching what is now the practice, and it is what I wanted to ensure. I support the proposal that has been put by Senator Faulkner. I think it is most reasonable and that that was the intention of the Senate when it voted only recently on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support what has been said by Senator Harradine. That was also our intention. I believe it was the intention of the Procedure Committee when we brought down this report. If honourable senators look at the diagrammatic sheet that the committee put out with its report they will see that we did intend taking note to be a feature. I said that when I spoke earlier. We did intend taking note to take the 30 minutes, as in the sessional order. That is why we supported&mdash;as Senator Harradine did&mdash;part (7)(a) of the opposition's amendment No. 18.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support that it should be one hour for the MPI or urgency motion and, if there is no taking note of answers, then the time allowable for that should be able to be added onto MPIs. That is another matter that the Procedure Committee wanted which is why it is in part (7) of Senator Faulkner's motion that we were voting on. All along our intention was that paragraph (7) should stand as printed with the addition of (7)(a) of the opposition's amendment No. 18. We believed we were voting on that. It was done on the run, which is always a mistake. That is always bound to happen when we get amendments three or four months after a report has been brought down. I recommend to everyone who wants to put up amendments that next time we get the amendments with more time to look at them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It seems to me to be extremely foolish to be attempting to draft on the run having got ourselves into some confusion. I am not sure that I agree with what has been expressed as to what the outcome is. I suggest that we proceed with what has been dealt with, adjourn this until tomorrow or Monday of next week, sort out exactly what has been done, see whether there are any other unintended consequences of the amendments, and come back if necessary. I do not see the problem that others think exists at the present time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Harradine's intention is to have the existing part (7) in the motion as moved by me as well as an extra paragraph (7)(a) which is contained in amendment 18 as moved by Senator Hill. It is quite clear what the intention was and Senator Harradine sought leave for this matter to be dealt with in that way. That was the intention; I think all senators are clear on it. This is just an unintended consequence. I do not think there is a necessity for us to go through the process of recommitting&mdash;I hope not. This is clearly one of those things that occurs, as Senator Bourne said, when something is being done on the run. Senators have heard the explanation that was given by both Senator Harradine and me. Madam Acting Deputy President, I did request of you to ask for the decision to be recorded in the way that senators intended. If that is not possible and your decision is not to do that, then I would move the appropriate motion. As you know, the report has not been put finally even though the amendments have been dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It has got to be properly drafted because the Senate has resolved to omit paragraph (7) and substitute paragraph (7)(a). As I understand it, that is the resolution of the Senate. Certainly that can be varied by a subsequent resolution, but that resolution has got to be put before the Senate in a proper way. I think I understand where the numbers are and when that is done I think I know what the result will be. We will oppose it because we say that an MPI should have a limit of two hours and not be further restricted to one hour. We would want a separate vote on that issue. When the drafting is done, it will be handled in the proper way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating two nursing home bills, namely the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 and the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993. These two bills are intricately linked. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) sets out the circumstances for the recovery of unspent nursing home benefits in respect of the period prior to 1 July 1993 from the vendor upon the sale of a nursing home. The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 enables this `nursing home' charge to be levied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills extend the National Health Amendment Act 1992 which made unspent nursing home benefits a recoverable debt upon the sale of a nursing home. Previously, such overpaid benefits could only be clawed back by imposing a negative loading on the new proprietor. The changes were effectively prospective, applying only to overpayments in relation to benefits paid after the commencement date of the 1992 amendments on 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A year ago when this bill was being debated by the parliament the nursing home industry made it clear that the recovery of unspent nursing home benefits as overpayments from a previous proprietor should apply retrospectively as well. Whilst the coalition parties would not normally support retrospective legislation, we contended that this was a special case which would result in more timely recovery and greater protection for innocent and possibly unsuspecting purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill takes heed of the industry's and the coalition's representations. While I do not criticise the government for introducing what is sensible legislation, this debate cannot be allowed to pass without recognising how frequently the coalition seems to be making the running in relation to important aged care reforms. This is a typical example. Late last year, Professor Gregory's funding review and the Macri documentation consultancy both lent support to many of the coalition's policy proposals. Brian Burdekin's report on mental illness has reiterated many of the concerns that the coalition has continued to express about dementia care, particularly in relation to the importance of purpose specific facilities and the need for more flexible respite services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) provides for the collection and recovery of unspent benefits in respect of a period prior to 1 July 1993. The amount of these unspent benefits will be assessed by the secretary and recovered as a `nursing home charge' levied on the vendor. These amendments will further protect the rights of purchasers, enabling them to purchase nursing homes unencumbered by debts incurred by the previous owners. As the `nursing home charge' is strictly a tax, the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 enables it to be levied on the proprietor responsible for the debt at the time of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will commence on the date of royal assent; that is, they will apply only to nursing home sales that are made after that date. However, minor amendments relating to the deadlines for investigations in relation to post June 1993 overpayments will be deemed to have commenced on 1 July 1993, as will clauses relating to interest that is payable by the Commonwealth on repayments to vendors resulting from estimated debts paid to the Commonwealth that are in excess of the actual overpayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum to the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 the government claims that it will have little direct financial impact. It is true that moneys collected from the imposition of the nursing home charge would otherwise be collected by way of negative loadings. However, as negative loadings are often applied over a considerable period of time, it is feasible that some financial benefits will be derived as a result of more timely recovery of debts. As the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 merely provides the mechanism for recovery of the charge, it has no direct financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take a little of the Senate's time to point out how the new debt recovery system, as outlined in this bill, will operate. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) introduces a new division 2A, titled `Nursing home charge', into the National Health Act. Under this section, if an investigation upon the sale or proposed sale of a nursing home finds that a fee-reducing or unspent benefit was paid to a proprietor prior to 1 July 1993, the secretary may give notice in writing of the amount of that benefit to the vendor. The notified amount is the nursing home charge and the vendor is liable for that charge. The notice must stipulate the amount of the charge and the date that it is payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary may amend an assessment within three years of its being made. An amended assessment may be made at the initiative of the secretary or by application from the payer. If the amendment results in a reduction in the charge, the amount of that reduction is taken to have never been payable. A liable person has 42 days to lodge an objection with the relevant minister in regard to an assessment. The minister must consider an objection and reject it or allow it in full or in part. An objection decision may be reviewed under the AAT Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sub-section 2 refers to the collection and recovery of the nursing home charge. The secretary may extend the time for payment. However, a 16 per cent per annum late payment charge applies. The secretary may remit some or all of the penalty in special or mitigating circumstances. The charge is recoverable as a debt through court proceedings. There are specific provisions contained in the bill for the recovery of the charge from persons with joint liability, from the trustees of deceased estates, and from unadministered estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 3 allows for the collection of the charge before the completion of a sale of a nursing home, either from the vendor, the purchaser, or both. Advance payments can occur if there is a likelihood that an assessment will reveal a vendor's liability or in the event that an assessment has actually revealed such a liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the appropriate notice of a sale has been given: an advance payment direction can only occur upon the completion of an investigation; is limited to the purchaser; and is regarded as consideration in the sale. If an investigation is ordered due to a lack of notice of a sale, an advance payment direction may be the result of an estimate of the fee-reducing benefit, and may also include the payment of any difference between the estimated amount and the original purchase price paid by the vendor. Any advance payments made as a result of estimates are held in trust and interest may be payable if they exceed the sum of the fee-reducing benefit and any post-30 June 1993 overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows the secretary to take into account any unpaid nursing home charge when setting a scale of fees and to accordingly reduce the fee that the proprietor can charge. If an outstanding charge is paid, a new scale of fees which reflects any underpaid general care benefits to the proprietor must then be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to subsections 65H and 65J allow the secretary to direct that pre-1 July 1993 nursing home charges and post-30 June overpayments be paid by nursing home purchasers when no advance payments have been determined. These amendments also allow the secretary to direct post-30 June 1993 overpayments to be paid by purchasers when an advance payment has been directed. The schedule to the bill replaces all references to the outdated `fee-determining benefit' with the new `fee-increasing benefit' in the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose these two interconnected bills. As I said earlier, it was the coalition that placed on the public record the concerns of the nursing home industry about the inadequacy of the post-30 June 1993 amendments that were contained in the National Health Amendment Act 1992. This bill takes up those concerns.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must not be forgotten that determinations of nursing home charges emanate from validations of nursing home funding by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Significant concerns about the department's administration of its validations program have been expressed by both the voluntary and the private sectors of the nursing home industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 September the coalition set up a Senate inquiry into all aspects of the validation of nursing home funding. The government will obviously claim that this bill will overcome some of the concerns that have been expressed by the industry about the validation process. To an extent, this is true. However, it is just as true that the success of the measures contained in this bill is inherently dependent upon the consistency and timeliness of the validation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory noted the uncertainty in the nursing home industry with respect to the tasks that can be claimed under CAM, and that this is resulting in problems during the validation process. He proposes that the Department of Health,  Housing, Local Government and Community Services issue a clarification of the categories of CAM tasks, stating the principles that apply to each category, and giving examples of tasks that do or do not fall into that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sue Macri also expressed concern about the validation process in her recent work. While her consultancy was predominantly concerned with the closely related issue of the RCI and RCI documentation, she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly, the current infrastructure established for the validation of CAM costs is not one which is viewed positively by the profession, mainly because of the negative emphasis on `lack of performance' rather than `performance'.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to put on the record that during a briefing on this bill, I asked the department whether a clause could be inserted in all written advices of estimates of determinations stating that the determination was an estimate only and advising that the principle of buyer beware should be adhered to by the purchaser. I would ask the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to give me an undertaking that this suggestion, or something achieving the same end, will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to note that a coalition amendment inserting a footnote that makes reference to section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 in relation to penalty units after sub-clause 65GT(5) of the bill was supported by the House of Representatives. That was in accordance with an earlier amendment to the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 that enabled users to identify the source of the new penalty units system. I would appreciate it if honourable senators, particularly ministers, when presenting legislation which refers to penalty units, would put in a clause or footnote to refer the reader back so that they know what these penalty clauses mean. It is important for us as legislators to ensure that, as far as possible, people can understand the law. One way of doing that is to see to it that they do not have to seek legal advice to find out simple things, such as what `penalty unit' means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that drafters will see fit to include such a footnote in all future legislation, as I believe would be the wish of this parliament. I hope that the minister will be able to address my question with respect to a purchaser about to purchase a property realising that the estimates of overpayments are only estimates and that there may be other liabilities that need to be written into any contract of sale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I will confine my remarks to the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill. This is the first part of a package announced in last year's budget and introduces new measures to address the problems of overservicing and fraud within Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say from the outset that the Australian Democrats are not impressed by this bill, particularly by the notion of peer review in this area. We are certainly not impressed by the level of influence that the AMA will be able to exert on this new process. We are not impressed by the total lack of consumer input or involvement at any level of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have some amendments to move, I stress that, for two reasons, the Democrats will not be voting against this bill. Firstly, we acknowledge this bill does introduce a better system than we have now. It will introduce a tougher process, and therefore is certainly a step in the right direction. Secondly, we see this bill as being the last chance for the medical profession to get its house in order. If this bill does not work, and I am putting on the record here that I believe it really will not work, then the government will have to say to doctors, `That is it. You have now had every opportunity through peer review to tackle the problem seriously; and you have failed to do so'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will then have to say it will no longer support the notion of peer review and will move to a process of outside scrutiny and control. In our view we have already gone past the point where peer review should be abandoned. The facts show that peer review has not worked in Australia or anywhere else in the world. I believe the only reason it is getting another chance is that the AMA has convinced the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) that it is worth another chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA has certainly done some very clever work to shore up its position in the aftermath of two very damaging reports about the peer review process, one by Harvey Bates for the Health Insurance Commission and the other one by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office report found that there was `a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners'. It also found that the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in this area had shown virtually no improvement since the early 1980s. The ANAO concluded that `the emergence of organised fraud and excessive servicing, protected by corporate veils and the best advice money can buy, represents a real challenge to the efficient and effective use of the health budget'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that the Health Insurance Commission's legislative powers were deficient and recommended changes to the legislation in order to get much tougher on fraud and overservicing. Harvey Bates reviewed the operations and procedures of the Health Insurance Commission's investigations unit and found that under existing legislation it did not provide a satisfactory base to support any positive investigations in significant cases of fraud. Bates recommended the development of a national fraud control plan&mdash;major legislative changes including giving the Health Insurance Commission adequate audit and entry powers. He also recommended increases in penalties. This is not, as he stressed, a small, minor problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1980, based on computer profiles of billing practices, the Department of Health put the extent of fraud and overservicing at least at seven per cent of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and the health funds. In 1982 the cost of fraud and overservicing was conservatively put at $100 million per year. If that same estimate is applied to today's budget we are up around $400 million a year. Bates estimated the cost was at least $300 million a year. I appreciate that the AMA considers these figures to be vastly exaggerated, but even if we accept the AMA's viewpoint we still have a major problem which is costing the Australian taxpayer a great deal of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course overservicing is not just about money. It is also about service provision. For example, unnecessary surgery is acknowledged as an ongoing and significant problem within the Australian health care system. Until now we have not been very good at cracking down on Medicare rorts and the Health Insurance Commission has a very poor record in investigating and prosecuting medical practitioners. Between 1985 and 1992 only 43 medical practitioners were penalised for fraud. In 1991-92 only four practitioners were prosecuted by the Health Insurance Commission. However, it is worth noting that all four were indeed found to have overserviced; and more than $1 million was reclaimed from just those four cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical services committee of inquiry also has a poor record in taking disciplinary action against practitioners for overservicing. From July 1985 to June 1992 only 88 practitioners were referred to the MSCI and, of these, only 51 were required to pay back any money&mdash;a total of $556,826. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General found four possible reasons for the low level of prosecutions and disciplinary action. The first was inadequate investigative powers; the second was a lack of comprehensive and effective legislative powers; the third was insufficient training for investigators; and the last was the Health Insurance Commission's emphasis on counselling and conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the previous health minister, Mr Howe, and the Health Insurance Commission were sympathetic to the recommendations made by the Auditor-General and Harvey Bates. In fact, in December 1992 the Health Insurance Commission began work on a legislative reform project to pick up some of the issues raised by the two reports. The commission set up an extensive round of consultations. One of the things it was asking about was the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry process. The commission was proposing to replace peer review with a much more independent process, one which was more in line with the decision-making and review processes in other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission started on that process only to have the rug pulled out from under it. It seems that this was done primarily because the AMA, which had been incredibly intransigent about any sort of changes&mdash;particularly improvements&mdash;to legislation in this area for a long time, decided it was going to adopt a new and far more responsible and reasonable attitude. The AMA then put in considerable efforts to convince the minister that it was ready to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure why that change came about. It could be that the AMA saw the writing on the wall, or that the new President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, is a very reasonable and responsible person; and he was able to work responsibly with the minister to come up with a compromise deal. Whatever the reason, the Health Insurance Commission was told to stop its consultative process. The AMA was in and the Health Insurance Commission was out. Peer review, which looked to be on its way out, was suddenly well and truly back on the agenda. This has resulted basically in a total lack of consultation about this bill with anybody other than the AMA&mdash;and it certainly shows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looked at this bill late last year, a number of submissions from other professional organisations expressed concern about the influence given to the AMA over the new peer review system. There are provisions within this bill which say that the minister must consult the AMA before appointing medical practitioners to the Professional Services Review Panel, before appointing panel members to be deputy directors and before appointing members to the Professional Services Review Tribunal. The provisions do not say `may consult', but `must consult'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest level of AMA influence can be found in new section 83(2) of this bill which says that the minister must not appoint a medical practitioner to be the director of the Professional Services Review unless the AMA has agreed to that appointment. In other words, the AMA has been given a power of veto over the appointment of the person who is going to head up the process. I really do find that extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA is not a neutral or independent group. It is, to all intents and purposes, the equivalent of a trade union for doctors. There is nothing wrong with that. I must stress that I believe it to be a very efficient and effective trade union which serves its members extremely well. I may not always agree with what the AMA says and does, but I will certainly be the first to acknowledge that it has done some very good work. I will give honourable senators a couple of examples. I have been very impressed by the AMA's recent efforts to draw attention to the link between high unemployment and poor health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also done some excellent work on the dangers of smoking and other related issues such as tobacco advertising and warnings on cigarette packets; and in the area of Aboriginal health it has brought to the minister's attention a range of different issues. I welcome the minister's recent involvement in the area of Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put the good work aside for a moment, the AMA is essentially a union obliged to put its members' interests first. To give a union veto power over the appointment of the person who is going to be inquiring into malpractice amongst its membership does not make a lot of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at it this way: imagine a bill which dealt with corruption on the waterfront where the government was setting up a panel to investigate and penalise waterside workers who were rorting the system. If the government came in here and said it was going to give the power of veto over to the ACTU, which is appointed director of that panel, everyone would be screaming from the rooftops&mdash;particularly the coalition. We would never hear the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But apparently it is okay for doctors to veto the appointment of a person who is investigating overservicing by doctors. I argue that not only is that inappropriate but it sends the wrong message about the government's so-called determination to crack down on fraud and overservicing. It is not enough to be independent; one must also be seen to be independent. There should be no suggestion whatsoever about any undue influence. How can that perception of independence possibly be maintained when one organisation has the power to stand in the way of the director's appointment? The simple answer is: it cannot&mdash;and I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to change that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern the Democrats have with this legislation is that there is absolutely no role in it for consumers, that is for the people who actually use the Medicare services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have accepted with considerable reluctance the Minister's and the AMA's argument that putting consumer representatives on the review panels would be particularly difficult. But I cannot see any reason why consumer representatives cannot be included in the tribunal stages of the review process. I do not think that the medical profession should be the sole arbiter of what constitutes improper practice. The health issues centre told the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A committee acting in the public interest should not be concerned solely with whether a practitioner's conduct is acceptable to his or her colleagues. Just as important is the issue of whether the practitioner's conduct is considered acceptable to the community. The disparity between how professional groups assess the public's best interest and how lay members of the public assess their own interests can be vast and significant.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats believe consumer representatives could play a valuable role on the tribunal. They would certainly make the process more publicly accountable. I think consumer groups are right when they complain that once again medical practitioners are getting a special deal from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups argue that regardless of disputes about the extent of the problem the government continues to treat illegal activities by doctors as being less serious than blue collar crime or social security fraud. Surely it is about time we started treating doctors and other professionals in the same way as everyone else who is caught ripping off the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did have a number of other concerns with this bill and they were addressed in the committee stage. I must again take the opportunity to say how worthwhile the Senate committee system is. This is another example of a lot of time saving for us in this chamber, and I commend the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for its hard work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by restating that I do not believe this bill will deliver, unfortunately. The reason it will not deliver is that this bill is not about public accountability; it is about accountability to one's peers and one's profession. I really do think that is a mistake. I remind the minister of the recent comment of the Hilmer committee on national competition policy, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No section of the community is entitled to be a judge in its own cause.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe those words will prove to be very prophetic in the case of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer solely to the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill part of this debate. The opposition is totally opposed to fraud. This legislation has resulted because the government has failed to control fraud. It has been in government for 10 years. What has been the result of its attempts to control fraud? Firstly, it has failed to understand how medical practice is conducted. It has failed to appreciate the honesty of the overwhelming majority of medical practitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Morgan gallup poll conducted last year by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine questioning people with varying occupations on honesty and ethics showed that medical practitioners came out on top. I will not tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, where politicians came on that poll, but I can leave it to your imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government failed in the past to control the rogues of the profession or successfully prosecute them, and its record in this regard is absolutely abysmal.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there is no valid basis on which any estimate of the level of inappropriate payment from the public purse can be made with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is now the position of the minister. Nobody knows for sure, although the minister put a figure on it in the budget last year. Last year, in reply to a question that I asked, he said that there would be a $100 million saving alone from pathology&mdash;as if that was all due to fraud and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister knows as well as I do that it was due to negotiations that were held between the Health Insurance Commission and the College of Pathologists whereby there were changes in the structure of pathology in relation to the number of pathology practices that were billing and the successive reduction in the rebates given for various procedures over a number of years. Rebates have been dropping behind the consumer price index. In fact, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no longer a single well established and commonly understood basis for the scheduled fee. Reductions in scheduled fee have generally resulted in reduced observance of scheduled fee by medical practitioners and increased costs for patients.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is an incentive built in for those who feel that they are badly done by. In fact, last week in my own state a neurosurgeon quite rightly was sent to gaol for defrauding the government. His defence was that he felt he was badly done by because of the rebates that his patients were getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has proposed various amendments, the thrust of which we support. Those amendments came out as a result of the referral of this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I commend the government for taking notice of the report of the Senate standing committee. The proposed amendments were in consultation with the various objections that were raised, and we support them. We support the Democrats amendment No. 3 omitting `the minister may make', and substituting `the minister must make', because that tidies up another small aspect of it. We do not support the rest of the Democrats amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table some supplementary explanatory memoranda to the government amendments. It is minor stuff but, nonetheless, it must be done. I would like to cover a few points that have been raised during the second reading debate. Allowing for the fact that this is a cognate debate, I would like first to address some of Senator Patterson's concerns on the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill before I address the remarks made by Senator Lees and Senator Herron.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked about, if you like, the caveat emptor situation for prospective nursing home purchases. The arrangements that are in this bill complement the protection that is already provided by earlier amendments and, subject to compliance with the existing requirements relating to the giving of notice of sale, should provide the protection which Senator Patterson feels is necessary. The purpose of the notice period is to allow sufficient time for any liabilities to be identified and advised, obviously, to both parties but, in particular, to the purchaser prior to a sale. Failure to  give correct notice is an offence. Notwithstanding such an offence, the vendor remains liable for any debts incurred prior to the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, because we have these new provisions does not mean that a purchaser should approach any potential nursing home sales transaction with anything less than the usual commercial diligence. On the introduction of the first stage of the amendments, the department sent a circular out to each nursing home operator and to industry representative groups explaining these new arrangements and stressing the continued importance of the buyers making sure that they are aware of any potential liability prior to the sale. The department plans to reinforce that importance at the commencement of these amendments through a further circular as well as in standard correspondence and sale situations. I think I am in a position to guarantee to Senator Patterson that, whenever the department is aware of a potential purchaser, that purchaser will be notified of these arrangements in the bill and, of course, of the need to exercise particular diligence in that situation. That having been said, I wish to turn to the remarks of Senator Lees and Senator Herron. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have said is that, whenever we are aware of a purchaser being involved, we will send that purchaser the document. I gave Senator Patterson that assurance privately when she came around because she had to leave and she was happy with the assurance, so I do not think there is a problem. If there is a problem, I will certainly come back to it, but I am not aware of one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall return to what I was about to say concerning the remarks of Senator Lees and Senator Herron. It is interesting to listen to the two of them because one could say that they have an opposite approach. Often in health matters these days I seem to be attacked from the left and the right. It is interesting being in the middle of these attacks. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have always been a centrist, and I find myself there again. On the one hand, Senator Lees has said that in some way I have been seduced by the AMA, the dreadful trade union representing doctors. On the other hand, a former state president of that same trade union&mdash;I had never actually thought of Senator Herron as a trade unionist&mdash;offered a different kind of criticism. Both are wrong, and I shall briefly outline why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is the case at all that the AMA  knocked on my door and came in and said, `Please give us a peer review system in overservicing'. That is far from what I think it wanted. I think it would have much preferred that I simply go away and not talk about it at all. But in looking at the government's record over 10 years, I became convinced that a different approach was necessary. First off, I acknowledge what Senator Herron said. The figures are there for anyone to dig out. We have not been able to recover anything like the amounts that I think we should recover. I do not accept the 10 per cent figure to which Senator Herron referred. I have never accepted the 10 per cent figure. I find the seven per cent figure a bit rich as well. I do not think there is any real basis for them. Certainly I cannot provide anybody with data to back up either claim. Until I can find a base, I will not make any outlandish claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been said, we had, first, to approach the difficulty that Brendan Nelson refers to consistently&mdash;being able to define what overservicing is. Overservicing is difficult to define. I find it hard, in looking towards the definition that we find here or in listening to anyone else's definition, to believe that I will be the appropriate person to make the decision. I think we have to look to the profession, which is, as far as I am concerned, a noble one. The people in the profession are, in the main, noble servants who do a grand job. I have enough faith in the profession and in its nobility to believe that it can take part in a genuine system of peer review and make sure that the rogues to whom Senator Herron referred are brought to justice and at least made to pay back the money that they need to from overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Senator Lees and Senator Herron referred to fraud. I am not going to because this is not a fraud bill. As I understand it, we will get to that later, and I will deal with it when we get to it. So I will not take up the remarks that they made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not true to say that the AMA walked in with this proposal and I adopted it. It is true to say that I looked at the work of the Health Insurance Commission and decided not to proceed down its path. I do not deny that. It has been working on that for a while. I did that because, as I said, in reviewing a decade's worth of work on this, I thought the basis of the approach that we had been trying was not working and that we ought to try a new one. The reason I thought the approach was not working is essentially that the profession has boycotted and frustrated the process from day one. It has done a pretty good job of it and continues to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the punitive approach, inevitably we got ourselves bogged down in medical services committees of inquiry where legal representation meant that these things took years rather than months, and further appeals followed. In fact, I am staggered by the fact that I am getting correspondence on my desk&mdash;I was busily signing some last weekend&mdash;where doctors have been involved for seven years in a process before I get to determine the penalty at the end of the day. I find that unacceptable. It must be unacceptable to the government, and I assume that it is unacceptable to the opposition, the Democrats and anybody else who wants to examine it. We cannot have a process that takes so long because, in the end, that is justice to no-one, not even to those who have done the wrong thing in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew that the frustration that the profession felt and which it had then demonstrated by its attitude to the process was going to be awfully hard to defeat. I am not one who is afraid of saying, `Let's try getting on together. Let's try a process of peer review where, if all of the noble words you have spoken are true, you will be able to make sure that if the wrong thing is being done it will be stopped'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much more importantly, what the process of peer review can achieve that the processes and the path that we have been down for the last 10 years can never achieve, is an effect on the rest of the profession who are not necessarily being investigated and who are not, therefore, feeling under threat. I wanted members of the whole profession to understand that there was a problem here and that if they were to transgress, then their own peers would come down upon them. I do not think that is a bad idea. I have supported it strongly. I think it has a much better chance of success than the kind of direction that I think Senator Lees is suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked not only to the AMA but also to a number of other organisations about it. If one is the health minister and one is looking at who to talk to in the medical profession, one talks to everybody, but it has to be acknowledged that the AMA is the most significant body and it would be pretty foolish to ignore it. I have obviously talked to Dr Peter Stone and his colleagues in their organisation, and all the others, but we cannot ignore the AMA. I must confess that over the last decade there have been a few times when I have wished we could, but we cannot and, therefore, I talked to the AMA. I never wanted it to be seen as the sole preserve of the AMA. I was happy when Senator Lees and others raised in the committee last year that we ought to make sure that the AMA kept to its undertakings and consulted other groups, so I am happy to accept amendments along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take exception to Senator Lees's remarks about it being, in some way, a terrible thing to have the AMA needing  to agree before the director is appointed. I think that makes it certain that the director is genuinely independent rather than have the person questioned. If it were the case that I simply stood up and found someone who I thought was appropriate and nominated that person, then there would be no question that that person would be independent of the AMA, but there may well be a question&mdash;and certainly it would be a question in the minds of members of the profession&mdash;as to what my relationship might be with that person. It would always be a matter of controversy, as it always has been with the HIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who heads up this organisation has, if one reads through the bill, considerable powers. Deciding whether to set up a review committee is, indeed, the heaviest of powers. I think we must have the profession onside for that appointment, otherwise we will go back to the boycott and the frustration of previous years. I am more than happy to discuss a potential head of that body with the AMA and come to an agreement on an appropriate person. That person will then have genuine independence in every decision that he or she makes. It would be very hard for either side to claim bias. That is what I believe is fundamental and necessary and so I am happy to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other remark about treating doctors' crimes as less serious than social security fraud or other forms of white collar crime, I think we will demonstrate with the fraud legislation that this is a matter that will be pursued ruthlessly and toughly. Fraud is fraud. It is different to this; there is no definition. That is straight out stealing  from the Commonwealth and if people are going to do that then, as far as I am concerned, they go to gaol. It is not a matter for any committee of inquiry to look into; it is a police matter and that is what it will be seen to be, but we will debate that on another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the view that if there were weaknesses with the HIC&mdash;and certainly the HIC never pretended that there were not weaknesses&mdash;and difficulties in it proceeding down the path of chasing doctors in the last 10 years, then a change would be necessary. I am delighted that it would appear these bills are going to be passed without any major opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot finish my remarks without referring to Senator Herron's reference to bulk-billing. There are the odd magnificent obsessions that run around the place from time to time and we have another example tonight. Members of the AMA have been getting themselves into a lather about bulk-billing for a decade. I am grateful for this because it has meant that they have got their Liberal Party mates in the same lather and have dragged them along the path of opposing bulk-billing on every occasion. We have dined out very well on this and we are happy. Keep it up. This is a major plus for us&mdash;although I note that Senator Herron's colleague, Senator Newman, has now started to say, `We might have to look at bulk-billing'. Gary Nehl, the honourable member for Cowper in the other place, who put out a very nasty letter bitterly criticising Dr Hewson and some of his colleagues&mdash;I was most appalled at the strength of the language in it&mdash;has also said that we have got to do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points about why bulk-billing  is irrelevant in this argument and why it is not the case that if we get rid of bulk-billing we get rid of overservicing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good, therefore, to say that we will call for the abolition of bulk-billing except for pensioners and cardholders, which is what those opposite said in the last election and all the other elections. At the end of the day, there is still $2 billion of the $3 billion there. So if bulk-billing was the cause, two-thirds of the cause would not even be touched and opposition senators could not expect any of us to believe that the whole of the overservicing exists in the other $1 billion. That is nonsense. We have to nail that. It is a silly line, but I hope Senator Herron keeps getting people to swallow it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to make my point anyway. When we look at the service data for what happens here, we see, and it is worth noting, that in New South Wales there is a bulk-billing rate of 64 per cent and 9 1/2 services per head per year. I think that was in 1989-90. I am using that year because that was the year the audit office used; I am sure that is right. In Tasmania, where the bulk-billing rate was much less at 45 per cent, there were only 7 1/2 services per head per year. So there is this great conclusion: less bulk-billing, fewer services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem with that assertion. That assertion ignores the rest of the evidence. In Western Australia in the same year, there was a bulk-billing rate of 56 per cent&mdash;a lot higher than in Tasmania but, nonetheless, less than in New South Wales&mdash;and the services per head dropped to seven per year. I would like to find out why this disparity occurs. I know that it has naught to do with bulk-billing. It is obvious, on the face of those facts, that the opposition cannot pursue it, but I am glad honourable senators opposite laugh and I am glad they keep doing it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will support the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill which will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, lead to the ratification of the convention and provide a legislative basis for its national implementation. In the 95 years since the first attempts at The Hague conference on chemical weapons and in the 69 years since their use&mdash;but not possession&mdash;was outlawed under the 1925 Geneva protocol, the international community has been trying to ban chemical weapons. The achievement of international agreement on this in January 1993 was a significant milestone. We applaud the efforts of the international community in having outlawed some of the most abhorrent and horrific of all weapons of mass destruction. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the first treaty in history to ban the development, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of an entire category of weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would like to give appropriate recognition to the role that Australia played. I make particular mention of the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and his department over the years. Because of my particular interest in this area, I witnessed the efforts of many dedicated and capable officers in his department. They can all be proud of the contribution that Australia made to the achievement of this very important agreement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is particularly pleased with the support gained within the Asia-Pacific region for the convention. We urge our regional neighbours to continue this commitment by ratifying the convention at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties inherent in the complex negotiations for the convention reflect the problems the international community has been facing and will continue to face as a result of the end of the Cold War. The so-called new world order, which was so optimistically talked of and which was to reflect a new era of global cooperation, has failed to eventuate. Instead, the international community is continuing to wrestle with a whole range of intractable problems&mdash;from bloody conflict in Bosnia to starvation in Africa, from political instability and economic hardship in Russia to human rights abuses in Burma. The list is long and difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question becomes that of what the international community can do to reach agreement on such difficult issues. To date, efforts, whilst diligent, have not been impressive. The issue of human rights, for instance, stands as an example of an international issue on which little agreement has been reached. The Vienna conference last year, which was designed to reach a greater international consensus on the undeniable need for consistency in the respect for human rights, did much to illustrate the divisions which exist but little to implement the practical schemes to ensure that individuals' rights are universally respected. In other words, a convention is not enough; it is just simply a starting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction&mdash;be they chemical, biological or nuclear&mdash;is potentially one of the most threatening developments of our age. The technology to deliver these weapons is becoming more widely available. Some states are showing little hesitation in selling both the knowledge and the materials necessary for their development&mdash;that is, both the warheads and the delivery vehicles. The continuing proliferation actions of states such as North Korea remain totally unacceptable to countries like Australia. The threats arising from possession of such weapons, the destabilising results and the uncertainty generated can trigger chain reactions that could lead to devastating outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of arms control and disarmament, the weakness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the role of the IAEA, as illustrated recently over North Korea, has become deeply disturbing. The need to strengthen and expand the missile technology control regime is urgent, as evidenced by the sales of sophisticated technology, even from within our region. Now that the Cold War has ended, the case for a comprehensive test ban treaty, particularly after China's large nuclear test last year, has strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chemical Weapons Convention is a step towards more encompassing arms control regimes. Although it has gained a more significant outcome than other international negotiations, it still suffers from similar problems. This is particularly the case with respect to the difficult problem of how the international community can bring pressure to bear on states which have no intention of conforming with the spirit or requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention or often of other such issues. The issue of compliance&mdash;how to encourage and enforce it&mdash;remains a major challenge to the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the level of support for the CWC. To date, 154 countries have signed the convention but only four have ratified it. The treaty will come into force when 65 signatories have ratified it. Australia is seeking to provide on example by promptly passing this legislation. We support that example. Let us hope that others will do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned about the limited international support the convention is receiving from those countries most likely to be interested in possessing, or which indeed already possess, chemical weapons. Not only have states such as North Korea not signed the convention; most middle eastern nations have not signed either. Given that the Middle East is the only certain theatre since World War II where chemical weapons have been used, this omission is obviously unsettling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chemical weapons are not difficult to make. The extent of Iraq's extensive chemical weapons program discovered after the Gulf War is an illustration of the ease with which states can develop and conceal huge chemical weapons arsenals. Iraq has declared, for example, 140,000 chemical weapons, 600 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent and 3,500 tonnes of precursor stock to United Nations inspectors, but it has still not been possible to determine whether this is in fact the total stockpile. Without the cooperation of the country concerned it would be therefore very difficult to enforce the provisions of the convention, whether that particular country is a signatory or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 20 states are believed to possess chemical weapons, many of which will not sign or ratify the convention. Therefore, as I said a moment ago, greater efforts need to be made to find ways in which such countries can be brought on board to accept the importance of the principles of this convention, and how it can enhance their security rather than threaten it. From there, apart from the issue of a cooperative enforcement regime, the international community has got to look to other ways in which it might be more effectively enforced in relation to states that are not willing to comply. I want to look briefly at verification. The effectiveness of the convention will also be limited by the effectiveness of its inspection and verification regime, which is already less than perfect. This was the most difficult part of the negotiations for the final agreement, and the verification provisions were then substantially watered down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention now provides for two verification regimes&mdash;a routine monitoring regime involving declarations and systematic inspections; and a challenge inspection regime where any state can request an inspection of any facility in any other state. Both regimes are likely to be limited in their effectiveness and dependent upon state cooperation. Problems such as we are witnessing in North Korea with respect to its refusal to allow adequate IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities despite it being a signatory to the NPT illustrate the likely difficulties ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern I have with the convention is the exceptions to it. I read that the use of chemicals for `law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes'&mdash;article II 9(d)&mdash;is not prohibited under the convention. There seems to be some ambiguity about this, but it is not hard to imagine ways in which states could develop chemicals for what they refer to as domestic riot control that could have other uses. The use of that as a means to avoid the effectiveness of the convention, and how that is going to be regulated, is something we are yet to see in detail. On its face, it does appear to be an obvious omission or concession that unfortunately can be abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want also to mention the role of industry. The Australian chemical industry has been totally supportive of this legislation and the convention and the process leading to the convention, and I commend it for that. It is obviously essential that chemical companies comply with a range of laws to ensure their safe operation. I hope that the government will ensure that there is not an unnecessary burden imposed on such companies which are pursuing genuine legitimate business aims in the need to comply with the convention. Of course, such compliance is paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber, we have some little concern with aspects of the cost. We note that Australia's annual contribution to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Hague, is estimated to be about $1.7m. That is one thing, but we also see that Australia is going to establish its own chemical weapons convention office at a cost of another quarter of a million dollars. We do not see, without further explanation, exactly why that could not be done within existing resources and within the skills of DFAT; that might be something that the minister is willing to address in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the convention does need to be strengthened. This is obvious from what I have outlined today. The coalition would urge that every effort be made bilaterally and multilaterally to overcome its shortcomings. The signing and ratification of the convention obviously must not be seen as the end point. It may not be the starting point but it is only a step along what is still a very difficult road. The convention must continue to evolve so that there can be greater reassurance that such weapons are effectively outlawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the convention does have limitations, it is an important step towards banning weapons which have an immediate and appallingly detrimental effect on human life and which should never be countenanced as a weapon of war. We on this side of the chamber will continue to maintain our long running support for the elimination of such weapons of mass destruction and thus we are pleased to support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) will be supporting the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993. I would like to look at a couple of aspects of international security in light of the chemical weapons convention. Some points have been made by Senator Hill. It is good to see that there is some degree of support from both sides of the parliament for continuing work on these aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, much gratitude is due to the people of the Australian government, at diplomatic forums and in departmental roles, for their current impressive success. There are, however, some matters that will require the further commitment of the Australian government and the international community. Unfortunately, the convention does not have universal coverage. Its greatest weakness in trying to provide stability in the international security environment is that some nations have not yet signed, and this has already been mentioned. Still, the emphasis is on `yet'. Efforts can and must continue to make it truly encompassing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will require the political will to keep up the pressure, firstly, at the United Nations level, where Australia can work on nations to sign the convention. There will be international conferences on chemical weapons where the importance to join can be stressed; and there are the usual diplomatic avenues through which Australia can promote the convention bilaterally. I certainly hope that the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) can maintain the good work of this convention which we are all so proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the encouraging points to look at is: what sort of a model does the convention provide for further reaching nuclear disarmament? While this convention might not easily transpose itself to the question of nuclear weapons, the level of cooperation and commitment from the international community is clear evidence that weapons of mass destruction can be renounced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chemical weapons have enjoyed momentary and marginalised praise in their history, having mostly received the condemnation due to weapons of mass destruction. On the other hand, the existence of nuclear weapons is entertained in many international bodies. Why is it, especially in the post-Cold War age, that there is not the political will to remove them too? The Nuclear Proliferation Treaty is a problematic treaty, for it is discriminatory in nature, accepting that some nations have nuclear weapons, and not providing mechanisms sufficiently able to remove them from the international security playing field. Indeed, the United Nations Security Council has its roots in the nuclear age, giving permanent membership status to those who first possessed the atomic bomb. It is like a club and that is the ticket by which one can join. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new process is needed. This means opposing an indefinite extension to the current nuclear proliferation treaty next year. I hope that this will be the focus of the Australian government. To push for an indefinite extension will be to provide for the indefinite existence of the nuclear threat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993. It is an important further step on the path to controlling weapons of mass destruction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the public memory of chemical weapons has faded, this country has a considerable experience of chemical weapons on the battlefield, dating from the First World War, when the Germans introduced a range of chemical gases&mdash;chlorine, phosgene, mustard and lewisite, to name some of them&mdash;which had devastating effects on Australian troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to read the battalion histories of some of the units involved in the First World War when gas was introduced. The soldiers talked about hearing the start of an artillery barrage&mdash;then the lack of any detonating, high explosive shells coming into the lines, only the soft plop of gas shells falling into the mud. Within the circumstances of the First World War, the fixed positions and the rigidities of trench warfare where one had high concentrations of troops in very precise positions&mdash;positions that could be located&mdash;the effect of chemical warfare in the form of gas was probably at its highest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to speak on this bill because I have been actively involved in the arms control debate in the past. I was very active in the Senate and in the general public debate in the last of the pacifist cycles&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;in the early to mid-1980s. There we had to counter the impractical policies of the nuclear disarmament groups. We had to argue for safer arms control measures, and the basic policy that we followed on this side of the chamber was the need for mutual arms reductions between both the West and the Soviet group; for verifiable procedures in relation to those reductions; and for balanced reductions of the forces so that neither side got an advantage. While we were not very strongly supported on that by the Australian Labor Party, interestingly, when it came into government, it adopted the policies that we had been espousing through the 1970s and the 1980s on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the bill. It follows on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which went through this Parliament in 1968 and was passed into law in 1970. That treaty was one of the many great achievements of the Liberal government which brought the golden age to Australian politics in the 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s. It is true to say that despite its limitations&mdash;because the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has the same limitations as this bill which Senator Hill went through, as evidenced by the inspection procedures which North Korea has not complied with in recent times&mdash;the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was a pacesetter at the time and certainly in advance of its time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chemical weapons fall into a class of weapons which are known loosely as weapons of mass destruction&mdash;the nuclear, chemical and biological group. The basis of the opposition to the use of those weapons is broadly on the lines that they are non-specific&mdash;their effect is not primarily restricted to the combatants in an armed combat. Generally, they are quite indiscriminate with respect to their targets. In the jargon of the times, they have a high degree of collateral damage&mdash;they damage civilian lives or civilian properties. Another characteristic may be a long-term or a residual effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the arms control debate, nuclear weapons have attracted most attention in the last 40-odd years because they are the newest and the most dramatic of the trio. The Cold War was fought successfully on a policy of deterrence. That particular form of deterrence was that of mutual assured destruction, which meant that if a pre-emptive nuclear strike was made by either the Soviets or the West against the other superpower bloc at the time, there would still be a residual power to strike back and to paralyse the opponent, so that nobody would win out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the time and on many occasions that, while I supported the policy because it simply was the only practical alternative we had at the time to succumbing to the Soviet Union, I always recognised that, while it had great dangers, it would never survive into the future and that some other sort of technology would emerge in the fullness of time to maintain the balance of peace between these two groups. Of course, it is a matter of history that, instead, the Soviet Union collapsed with great rapidity, to the surprise of all of us. We then saw the end of the Cold War and since then we have seen the beginning of the dismantling of the world's nuclear arsenals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unquestionably, security from nuclear attack or from nuclear misadventure now has been very significantly reduced compared to what it was a decade ago; but we will never get rid of nuclear weapons. Sadly, there will be a need for somebody to maintain them in the world because we simply cannot tolerate one nation holding the rest of the world to ransom by the possession of a nuclear weapon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the tensions relating to the Cold War have diminished, there are still a number of residual problems coming from the great arsenals that existed in the 1970s and 1980s. It is impossible to know the number of nuclear weapons in the world. Some estimates are that the United States had about 50,000 weapons, so presumably the Soviets had about the same. To that one has to add the arsenals of France and the United Kingdom. So a figure in excess of 100,000 nuclear weapons may not be an unreal estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element that we have to look to is the way the weapon inventories have been maintained. In the Western nations the inventories are reasonably accurate. As weapons were replaced by successive technological advances, the preceding generation of weapons was either dismantled or destroyed. It is a very different situation in the Soviet Union or its successors. Firstly, its inventory control is nowhere near as tight as that which existed in the Western nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the breakup of the Soviet Union the control of those weapons has moved into various hands. We have seen the rivalry over the possession of nuclear weapons between the state of Ukraine and the CIS. I am absolutely certain that, given the breakup in the social order in the Soviet states, nuclear weapons have been sold to third countries about which we know nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most worrying things about the Soviet Union was that it apparently never destroyed any weapons when they were replaced by more advanced designs&mdash;weapons went into various stockpiles. It is accepted that all the nuclear weapons built in the Soviet Union still exist there. Given the lack of inventory control, that is very worrying for the world in relation to arms control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with nuclear weapons is the covert acquisition of nuclear weapons by countries like Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa and, of particular relevance to Australia, North Korea. While we would all love to get rid of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons technology now is available to countries which have money. There has been a proliferation of nuclear weapons and we simply cannot contemplate any nation being held to ransom by another nation with a nuclear weapon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly tonight in support of the Hunter Valley bid for the $1 billion Royal Australian Navy minehunter contract. Three companies have been invited by the Commonwealth to tender for the project which involves building and fitting out six state-of-the-art minehunters. The companies are Australian Defence Industries, Australian Submarine Corporation and Transfield Shipbuilding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales&mdash;and particularly the Hunter region&mdash;is far ahead of the other centres vying for the contract. The Hunter Valley is one of the powerhouses of the Australian economy, with the resources and industry necessary to grow and add much to the nation's wealth. Let me outline some of New South Wales', and particularly Newcastle's, advantages over its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales has the highest concentration of advanced high technology, electronic and computer system suppliers. New South Wales has the largest glass reinforced plastic facility in Australia. It is the home of both of the preferred sonar suppliers, and most of the other potential suppliers of the crucial elements to the combat systems. It has a greater concentration of manufacturing and high technology research and development companies than the other locations. New South Wales houses the Navy fleet base, maritime headquarters, mine warfare base and mine warfare systems centre. The vessels will be based at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS> in Sydney. The Navy trials, training and evaluation programs will be carried out in Sydney. Being close to the Navy is both cost-effective and convenient. Forty five per cent of Australia's electronic and electrical engineers, and 40 per cent of our computer professionals, live in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will create up to 1,000 jobs, which will last during the eight year life-span of the project. The successful bidder and its overseas design partners are required to build the vessels achieving at least 60 per cent Australian content. New South Wales is the only state where the necessary breadth and depth of skills and technological capacity to facilitate this level of Australian content can be achieved at an acceptable price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will attract more investment to Australia from businesses wishing to capitalise in the attractive infrastructure base of the Hunter Valley.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only fair that the region receives the contract after losing the frigate and submarine contracts over the last few years. Newcastle has established shipbuilding sites, the expertise and, most of all, the will to complete this project to world class standards. It is an area of great economic and social potential, and Newcastle and the Hunter Valley need to be nourished by government. The area needs to be nourished for the benefit of all industry. What better nourishment could there be than this $1 billion contract?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Common use arrangements are not contracts in the strict legal sense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware of the CNRM peace plan, presented by Mr Jose Ramos Horta, Special Representative of the CNRM, to the Council of Foreign Relations in New York on 14 May 1992. The Government is familiar with the details of the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a), (b), (c) : The Government commented on the peace proposal when it was presented in 1992. I refer the honourable senator to my reply to a Question without Notice recorded in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 28 May 1992 (p. 2909). At that time the Government made it clear that while the peace proposal was interesting it was not one on which the Government proposed to take any action.  This remains the Government's position. The reasons for this are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) It is by no means clear that the proposal has the full support of the East Timorese community. For example, on the "World Today" radio program of 21 May 1992,  Australia&mdash;based East Timorese activist Mr Alfredo Ferreira was reported as saying that he doubted whether there would be widespread support for the idea of ceasing to resist Indonesian rule, and that Mr Horta's views were his own and did not necessarily represent the views of other East Timorese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) To the extent that the proposal leaves open the question of sovereignty over East Timor, it is inconsistent with the position of the Australian Government. In 1979 the then Coalition Government extended de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. This has been maintained by successive Labor Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government continues to regard the peace plan as a matter for the Indonesian Government. As the Government said at the time the proposal was presented in 1992, if the peace plan had the effect of contributing to the longer&mdash;term reconciliation process in East Timor, the Government would welcome it. The Government has long made known its views on the need for a reconciliation process in the province and has urged the Indonesian authorities to sit down with the people of East Timor, including the armed resistance, in a forward&mdash;looking spirit. The Government believes a reconciliation process in East Timor would include improved social and economic development in the province and greater recognition of its distinctive cultural identity. The Government has also made clear that the security forces need to be more sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the East Timorese, and that a reduction in troop numbers would be a major step towards improving the situation in East Timor. The Government has indicated to the Indonesian authorities that reconciliation might be assisted by giving the people of East Timor a significantly greater say in the running of their affairs, and possibly some greater degree of autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government welcomes the Indonesian Government's announced plan to downgrade the nature and level of its military presence in East Timor. The disbanding of the province's special military command in April 1993, leaving the provincial level command to assume security management of the province, places military arrangements in line with those in other provinces in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) In the circumstances, the Government does not intend to raise this peace plan proposal with the Indonesian Government. It can be assumed that the Indonesian Government is aware of the matter.</PARA>
