<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: are Australian families facing another increase in mortgage interest rates before Christmas as reported in today's press? Would the forecast one per cent rise in mortgage interest rates add another $76 to the monthly mortgage payment on an average loan? How does the government expect families, particularly those in the bush, to cope with another rise in mortgage interest rates while many of them are still looking for jobs and security in their existing employment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator talks about last time. It is the case that Westpac raised its variable home loan rates by 0.75 per cent. Yes; indeed it did. ANZ followed suit, but it took it, I think, nearly two weeks to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I said was that it was not anticipated in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the important point to make is that competition in the banking industry still does apply. We have the situation where NAB announced, as recently as 14 September, that it would not be increasing its variable home rates for a period of time, and the Commonwealth has similarly announced that it did not yet see all the factors justifying an increase. So there is that competitive environment around the place which is serving to curb what might otherwise be the instincts of some of the banks to improve their financial position at the expense of home loan borrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general situation is that the interest rate environment has been addressed by the Reserve Bank moving proactively, as it did some weeks ago, to increase official interest rates by three-quarters of a per cent to head off inflationary pressures before they emerged. A number of other countries have acted in a similar manner, and the markets and most commentators are indicating considerable satisfaction with the appropriateness of current settings. So, Mr President, we are seeing once again the opposition utilising or advancing its well-known track record of seeking to create interest rate speculation for thoroughly base motives, and it should as usual be ignored.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister that on the last occasion he said that there was no need for official interest rates to rise and then, once they had in fact been lifted, he said that it was a necessary part of the recovery. Now we see people such as Don Argus, the Managing Director of the National Bank, saying last weekend that his bank expects, in its economic forecast, another hike in official interest rates before Christmas. That is, as is the usual practice, contrary to what the minister said&mdash;and I remind him again&mdash;when he claimed that there was absolutely no reason to believe any increase would flow through to housing mortgage interest rates. Does this not all mean that, as the recovery further continues, interest rates will go up and that in fact that is government policy; and that, as official interest rates go up, mortgage rates will go up? Is that not why the press today is speculating that Australian home buyers will suffer more as a result of this government's policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not a great deal I can add. Of course, it is the case that interest rates will continue to be adjusted as appropriate and necessary to reduce the risk of the economy overheating, and overheating 12 to 18 months out&mdash;that is the cycle we are trying to anticipate&mdash;and to avoid a situation where it is too little too late, which has been the case in the past. It is our expectation, though, as I have said before and as the Treasurer said before, that on this approach interest rates will not need to rise to anything like the same extent that they have in past cycles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not impossible that there will be some further rises. Of course, it is perfectly possible that there will be some further adjustments, but it is reasonable to expect that they will be small and nothing like what we have seen in the past. Equally, whether or not there is a flow on for any given official cash rate rise into the housing market will depend on a number of factors. Automaticity should not be assumed, any more than proved to be the case last time around, with two banks still holding out from any rise at all. It will depend very much on the overall banking environment, with the competitiveness in that industry being a crucial factor.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. I refer the minister to his recent visit to China and the special wool industry seminars being held in China to promote the Australian wool industry. Can the minister report on the developments since the forging of closer links between Australian wool exporters and processors and Chinese importers and mills? In particular, what are the prospects for the Chinese government agreeing to removing its high tariff barriers on greasy and processed wool imports?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="962" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones has raised a very important issue. Recently a major wool industry delegation was in China and conducted a series of seminars in key wool and textile industry regions, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to launch that series of seminars. In the course of that visit, I took the opportunity significantly to promote Australian wool exports and to reinforce our recognition of the importance of wool exports to Australia overall and our exports to China in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia exported $700 million worth of wool to China in 1993, and such exports are growing very quickly. China is now our No.1 wool export market. One of our key objectives has been to cement cooperation between the Chinese and Australian wool and textile industries, and this delegation, which the industry and Austrade put together, made an important contribution to that. There are projections that China's consumption of wool may well double over the next two decades, and Australia could well keep its market share, which would mean another $700 million of wool exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a key issue, a critical issue, in the long-term growth of our wool exports to China&mdash;and that is the question of the access China will permit Australia as part of the terms of its accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This was an issue I took up, particularly with my counterpart trade minister, Madam Wu Yi, and I think we made some important progress in the negotiations during my recent visit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, in my meeting with China's minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation, she provided me with an assurance which she asked me to convey to the Australian wool industry, which is this: an assurance that the present level of Australian wool access to the Chinese market would be maintained and that there would be provision for future expansion of Australian wool exports. She also assured me that China's accession to the GATT would not hurt Australian wool exports. She asked that this assurance be conveyed and has given the recognition that we are both significant beneficiaries of the wool trade. I am not saying that we are yet satisfied with the outcome of our negotiations with China on wool access&mdash;we are not&mdash;but this assurance gives us a good platform. It gives us a good base.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson keeps interjecting, of course we want the Chinese to drop the tariff. That is the proposal we put to them. It is what they should do; it is the only reasonable course of action they should take in the process of negotiating their access to GATT. We continued to put that proposal to them. We have put a new series of proposals to them. My concern was that negotiations were deadlocked. We had our position; they had theirs&mdash;and there was no progress. It is all very well having a noble, well-articulated position, but we do not get an agreement if one side has a good position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have broken the deadlock as a result of these discussions. I believe that we now have the opportunity to recommence the negotiations on China's GATT accession, free up those negotiations and provide the setting for a more productive dialogue on Australia's access to the China wool market. Officials from both sides have now been given the job of examining the details of an acceptable argument. I think we are back on track towards a reasonable settlement. The Australian wool industry has been consulted in all these discussions, and will continue to be consulted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Childs asks relates to an issue raised yesterday by Senator Bell. However, Senator Hill, the shadow minister for education, could not resist putting out a statement, based on inaccuracies, accusing me of not being correct in my answer on behalf of Mr Crean. I just want to put the record straight so that members of the opposition do not go around misleading themselves and the public. There are a number of facts which need to be stated about this issue. Senator Hill refers to so-called cuts in funding since 1983. In fact, the total Commonwealth funding on higher education will have increased from $3 billion in 1983 to $4.8 billion in 1995, an increase of more than 60 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Hill interjects, because that is the very next point I will respond to. Commonwealth funding per student has risen steadily since 1987, when it was $11,457, to a projected $12,157 in 1996. I emphasise to Senator Hill and others that it is the university's decision as to which postgraduate courses it will charge fees for, what the level of those fees will be, and when it will charge those fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been prepared to relinquish some of its decision making authority to the universities, a policy which sought to promote flexibility, innovation and institutional autonomy&mdash;something I would have thought the opposition was in favour of. The decision to allow universities to charge postgraduate fees was part of this strategy and was developed in conjunction with the universities themselves. Furthermore, this freedom was provided without any reduction in the government's commitment. Indeed, we have increased the resources we provide to the postgraduate provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, government funds to postgraduate courses at the ANU have increased. Commonwealth funded postgraduate places will grow from 995 in 1994 to 1,030&mdash;a clear increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any official information about the activity of the NRMA informing its members about tax implications. But, given that at least one member of my family is a member of the NRMA and I have seen the material that has been received, I can say that it includes information about the capital gains tax implications of either the tax or the cash option. That is in the booklet I have received. As I have said, I have no further official information, but I have seen that in the booklet. That is the only information I can provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the average tax obligation, that is not something about which I can speculate. It would depend upon a whole range of other factors concerning a person's tax situation. That is the point Senator Bourne raised in her second question. But I can say that the Treasurer has announced that, should this proposal go ahead, we will introduce legislative amendments to reduce what would otherwise be the very heavy tax imposts that would fall on people&mdash;some part of the proposal is seen as people cashing out their own reserves, so they ought not be taxed. The government will seek to reflect that in some amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that people will still have some tax liability, but that is not what some might call a windfall for the government&mdash;people are getting income and therefore they are paying tax on it. People get income and they pay tax on it. That is exactly what the principle should be and that is what should happen. We will introduce changes not to increase our tax take but to reduce it. I think it is an appropriate measure that is being proposed by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether the NRMA board has fully investigated all tax neutral alternatives, the government certainly does not go around giving advice to people as to what sort of tax alternatives they should take, although I am advised that the board did consider a range of options about how it might distribute reserves to members.

What we do have is the continued operation of the Prices Surveillance Authority mechanism. It may be that this is an appropriate area for particular monitoring or scrutiny activity to take place so far as that authority is concerned. I will draw this matter to the attention of the appropriate minister and see what might be thought appropriate in this respect.

If that is the nature of the concern Senator Panizza has, as to whether particular retail price increases would in fact be justified if they were purported to be linked in some way to drought conditions, that may be an appropriate thing for the PSA to look at.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the Senate of the current situation in Rabaul following the volcanic eruptions? Are any Australians involved and, if so, are they safe? Has the Australian government been approached to provide emergency relief assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators&mdash;indeed, all Australians&mdash;will share my concern about the extent of the suffering and the damage that has already been caused by volcanic eruptions in Rabaul since early yesterday morning. Rabaul holds a place in the hearts of many Australians, including those who served there during the Second World War and, subsequently, during the pre-independence administration, or those who have been there as tourists or visitors, or have lived and worked there in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The devastating circumstances of the eruptions have made it very difficult to gain an absolutely clear picture of the present situation with respect to both the effect on the population of the area and the effect on the physical infrastructure of the town and the surroundings. There can be certainly no doubt that the destruction and the dislocation which has already been caused will have a devastating and long-term impact on the livelihood of the people of east New Britain, on the economy of the island's region and perhaps indeed on the economy of Papua New Guinea generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation is this: volcanic activity in Rabaul commenced suddenly on 18 September&mdash;two days ago&mdash;and five vents from two volcanoes continue to discharge tonnes of volcanic ash and rock debris high into the atmosphere. It is estimated that Rabaul is now covered by 75 centimetres of volcanic ash, mud and rock debris. Papua New Guinea authorities are hopeful that the easing of subterranean pressure through discharges from those five vents will reduce the risk of further violent eruptions; but, of course, nobody can be absolutely sure. The arrangements that were made by  the Papua New Guinea authorities to evacuate the 30,000 residents of the town and the surrounding areas to safe locations appear to have been very effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received reports now of two fatalities, but they remain unconfirmed as to the precise details. Certainly there will be extensive damage to the airstrip, which is close to one of the volcanoes, and to high density housing; but again it is premature to make an estimate of the scale of that damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal Australian community in Rabaul is estimated by the High Commission to number approximately 200, and all of those have been evacuated safely, with one exception which I will come to in a moment. Our High Commission in Port Moresby has advised that the small number of additional Australian tourists in Rabaul at the time have also been assisted in moving to safe areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no reports of any Australian casualties, but we are concerned about the welfare of one Australian citizen who did not in fact depart Rabaul at the main evacuation stage. The High Commission has so far been able to maintain telephone contact with him. The PNG National Disaster and Emergency Services organisation is aware of his situation. There was a rescue operation attempted late yesterday but that was unsuccessful. Efforts will continue as conditions permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to assistance more generally: our staff in Port Moresby and in the Rabaul vicinity are in close contact, as honourable senators would expect, with Papua New Guinea officials to determine in what areas we might be able to provide assistance in the current situation and the form that it might take. At this stage there has not been a request from the PNG government for assistance, but we anticipate that there will be a need for water filtration equipment, for temporary shelter, for water containers and for food as short-term requirements. We have a Hercules aircraft on stand-by to respond with emergency supplies and, if needed, aircraft shuttle services as soon as these needs are confirmed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that the problem of child labour exists in our region&mdash;undoubtedly in some countries that trade with Australia&mdash;but the first thing to recognise is that child labour does not come about because parents in those countries care less about their children or delight in having their children go out to work.

That is what they chorused; `He did not say that.' The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was included in that. I take the opportunity to table at least six publications where Mr Sharp did in fact raise taxation relief.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have this question. This is a very important day for this question to come up because today is the day on which one of the twice-yearly indexations of pensions will occur for pensioners across this country. That means an increase of up to $3.50 per fortnight for single pensioners and $2.90 per fortnight for each member of a couple. These increases represent a 1.1 per cent increase in the consumer price index for the first half of this year. The new maximum payment rates, including pharmaceutical allowance, will be $326.80 per fortnight for a single pensioner and $270.80 for each member of a couple. At the same time, the maximum rate of rent assistance will increase by 80c per fortnight. The new cut-out points beyond which no pension is payable exceed the equivalent of $19,300 per year for single pensioners and $32,200 per year for pensioner couples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the second part of Senator Zakharov's question, very importantly this extra indexation maintains the government's benchmark of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings for pensions. Indeed, that long-term ambition of the government was reached in May 1990 and has been maintained ever since. In fact, the latest available data from May 1994 shows that we are ahead of the commitment and that pensions are now about 25.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. In real terms, which may be an even more significant figure, the standard pension is now 14 per cent greater than when we came into office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That record stands in remarkable contrast to the record of the opposition. During the opposition's last term of office, if anyone can remember that, the real value of the pension declined by two per cent.</PARA>

<PARA>The question I asked was straightforward. It stemmed from widespread press reports about the Australiana Fund, which has been running fundraising activities for 17 years or so for the purchase of furnishings and artworks for the Lodge and other official residences of the government. The fund comprises people who have a strong faith in and commitment to the heritage of this country, people who have worked hard to assist in the purchase of many millions of dollars worth of furnishings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened, I believe&mdash;and an honest answer to my question to Senator Gareth Evans would have revealed this&mdash;is that about 12 months ago the fund was involved in a dispute in relation to a certain Thai teak table which Mr Keating wished to purchase from his mate Paul Kenny. The fund, I think correctly, the art community and other people who are experts in the area did not feel that it was appropriate that such a table be purchased within the fund's guidelines. Hence, this request from Mr Keating was refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we are seeing the politics of the payback. Mr Keating is well known for his commitment to getting even with people who cross his path. We remember that just after the last election those business groups that campaigned against Mr Keating were treated shabbily and, in some cases, threatened by Mr Keating and his ministers. We are seeing part of that pattern of behaviour in this case. The difference is that the people who make up the Australiana Fund work without payment and are committed to the heritage of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 17 years the prime ministers of this country, stretching back through Mr Hawke and Mr Whitlam&mdash;Labor prime ministers&mdash;and Mr Fraser and others, have been more than happy, and have felt it appropriate, to open the grounds and the lower quarters of the Lodge once a year to allow Australians to see the grounds and furnishings which they as Australians own&mdash;not Mr Keating. I think this has worked well. It has been quite a feature of life here in Canberra and elsewhere where these official places are located. </PARA>

<PARA>The minister was courteous enough to apologise because he cannot stay in the chamber to hear what I have to say but he promised to monitor the discussion. I believe that the minister descended to an unworthy depth in the discussion on this item by saying that I was trying to make people feel good or that I was trying to put forward a measure that was designed to make us or somebody else feel good. I offered the minister a very tangible method of addressing the problem of child labour, which has been detailed&mdash;and in quite appalling detail&mdash;in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child labour: the world's best kept secret</EMPHASIS> by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This organisation also offers a number of campaign points as to how this problem could be addressed. Section 9 of its campaign states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only piece of legislation on child labour that seems to have had a wholesome effect in India is ironically the Child Labour Deterrence Act introduced in the U.S. Senate by Tom Harkin. As a result of the threatened loss of the U.S. market "in Bangladesh the textile exporting industry association has put increased pressure on its affiliates&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, on its members, on its manufacturers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to clean up their factories and come into line with Bangladesh legislation on child labour."</PARA>
<PARA>Similar reactions have been recorded in other countries&mdash;India, Pakistan and Nepal&mdash;where a labelling system has been introduced which guarantees that carpets have not been made with child labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggested to the minister that Australia should consider applying economic sanctions; in other words, say that we will not import goods that have the blood of children on them. If we took that position, we could really make an effect in this area. The technical objections that the minister raised really do not hold much water. We had no hesitation&mdash;the Democrats supported it&mdash;in passing in the Senate the child sex tourism legislation which relied on evidence of Australian citizens travelling abroad engaging in certain practices. Certainly, there were problems with providing the right evidence and so on, but the bill coped with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned another example. Anti-dumping measures rely on obtaining information from overseas countries. While the anti-dumping legislation that we use has not been as successful as it could have been, nevertheless, it has been successful enough to raise some objections from some of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that the minister made is that, if we stopped child labour in poor countries, those children, their families or, for that matter, their community could be poorer still. I refer him to evidence that child labour actually displaces adult labour in those countries and depresses the wages of adults, leading to more poverty by maintaining its continuance rather than the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the minister said that this was an area that should be addressed on a multilateral basis.

<PARA>The reason I take note of the answer is that it is important, as Senator Crowley pointed out, to reaffirm that pensions are indexed. She said that it was important to reaffirm it today because the indexation flowed through today. I say that it is important that she made that reaffirmation because of the now obvious impact of the Keating Labor government's financial and economic mismanagement of this nation, which sees the massive pressure on interest rates in Australia now re-emerging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen interest rates increasing in the last couple of weeks. We see today speculation in the press that interest rates will yet again rise before Christmas. It is important that all Australians, but particularly pensioners, understand that it is the massive, runaway Commonwealth own purpose spending that is placing this pressure on interest rates. What this simply means is that the spending power, particularly of low income earners and pensioners, will be diminished. These interest rate pressures hurt most of all those who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple message that I give to the Australian people, particularly to pensioners, is that these interest rate pressures are the result of interest rates going up simply because the Australian government is not prepared to cut its own spending. The Australian government should have a mini-budget. The Australian government, the Keating Labor government, should ensure that its runaway Commonwealth own purpose spending is cut so that it does not cut the spending of citizens, particularly pensioners, by increasing interest rates. That is the core message for the Australian people: this government is cutting your spending because it will not cut its own spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that Senator Crowley had to raise this today because pensioners are reading the newspapers. They understand that, because of the government's massive deficits, because of its runaway spending, because of its spendthrift nature, because it is not prepared to run a sensible fiscal policy, the interest rates that all Australians have to pay are going up. So of course it is timely that Senator Crowley should seek to reassure pensioners that their pensions will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boom-bust cycle is at it again. Interest rates are going up and the pressures on inflation to go up will make it go up as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Childs this day, relating to proposals to charge fees for graduate courses at the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA>The subject of the question asked today by Senator Childs is the decision by the Australian National University to charge $5,000 for a legal workshop postgraduate course to enable law graduates to obtain the qualifications necessary to begin their professional careers. The essence of Senator Schacht's answer was to correct the very poor answer that he had given to a question I asked yesterday which asked the same thing&mdash;why was the Australian National University put into a situation whereby it had to charge such fees? The implication in my question was that it was a direct result of government policy and actions. Senator Childs's question sought to give Senator Schacht the space to correct that impression; but he could not do so because the fact is that that is why the Australian National University is in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht attempted to follow the line of the minister responsible, Minister Crean. Senator Schacht's answer attempted to follow the line that the Australian National University had options and that it could do a number of things. I suggest that the ANU was presented with very Hobson-like choices: it could use the alternative of cutting other courses; it could charge other courses; it could seek the cooperation of the profession in the ACT to engage in a joint program to give professional experience in fields such as articles, as is done to some extent in some states. Each of those choices was forced onto the university by the government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht attempted to confuse us&mdash;or at least to provide us with enough facts and figures to make it hard to trace&mdash;by suggesting that the government had increased spending on education. That may be so. It is quite a superficial line to pursue that, overall, the government's spending and allocation of funds to tertiary education has increased in recent years. Of course it has. The most useful figure&mdash;the figure which is real; the figure which has a direct impact on how much money universities have available to spend on courses&mdash;is the funding per equivalent full-time student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A table contained in a 1992 paper produced by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Universities in a changing world: report for the 1993-95 triennium</EMPHASIS>, sets out the allocation that the federal government made between 1983 and 1992. Quite simply, the government's funding per equivalent full-time student declined from a provision in 1983 of $10,377 to $9,302. For the minister to try to hide behind any suggestion that funding had increased is both duplicitous and misleading. To attempt to do that in an explanation of this situation should be condemned. It should be recognised for what it is: an attempt to weasel out of the very recognisable fact that funding has reduced and therefore universities have been put in the position of having to charge students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, students are over a barrel because unless they engage in the postgraduate course the initial qualification of the first degree will be useless. The minister should be condemned. This government should be recognised for doing what it has done&mdash;putting students in a situation where their qualifications are useless unless they pay $5,000 up front to be able to start in their profession. </PARA>

The reference is a complex and difficult one which involves balancing a number of competing interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I am discussing a matter of public importance with my colleagues, and it is particularly pertinent because tomorrow, 21 September, is International Alzheimer's Day. In the Senate two weeks ago we noted Alzheimer's Week, which was an Australian national week at the beginning of this month, but tomorrow is, in fact, the international day. Alzheimer's disease, which is the term now used for general forms of dementia, was first described by a man called Alzheimer when he diagnosed people who had dementia of the senile type at a very early age. There are, of course, a number of dementias, and that word is used to cover dementia as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of public importance because with a rapidly ageing population, particularly in the over-80-year-olds, Australia is running out of time to address properly the needs of older Australians, particularly the needs of the escalating number of people with dementia and also their carers. For too long this government has ignored the magnitude of this problem and has failed to implement adequate policies to ensure that older Australians can live with dignity, security and the best possible care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics are enough to jolt us into action and concern. The population over 65 years suffering from dementia was 11.09 per cent in 1990 and is expected to increase to 13.46 per cent by the year 2011 and a massive 20.08 per cent by the year 2031. Within 40 years, the number of Australians aged 65 years and over will have grown from nearly 2 million in 1991 to about 5.2 million in 2,031. Australia is also experiencing a very rapid growth in what is referred to as the `old old' population. The population over 75 years is expected to be nearly 11 per cent by the year 2051, while the number of persons over age 80 is likely to increase six-fold by the middle of next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rapidly increasing ageing population has enormous implications for all Australians, particularly for the government, in terms of health and social security expenditure, retirement income and many other policy areas. A rapidly ageing population also has significant implications for the number of older people who will be affected by dementia, and I think it behoves us to consider a few of the statistics here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dementia affects 20 per cent of people aged 80 years and over and about five per cent of those over 65 years of age. We must not forget too that it is no discriminator of people because it affects also some people in a very young age bracket. As I mentioned before in this chamber, a friend of mine has a husband aged 52 with full-blown Alzheimer's disease. That poses problems for his wife, who is a carer as well as a mother of teenage children who are still dependent on her and her family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, between 100,000 and 140,000 Australians suffered from moderate to severe dementia, and this number is expected to exceed 200,000 within this decade. Dementia affects an enormous and growing number of people. It is the most common mental health problem among people over 80 years, and is a relatively common problem in younger people, those between 65 and 80 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in eight adults are likely to develop dementia in their lifetime, whilst Alzheimer's disease is the fourth largest killer of adult Australians. Approximately half of Australia's dementia sufferers live at home. A substantial number live in residential facilities such as hostels or nursing homes. However, many are homeless or live in boarding houses or refuges where they frequently receive no formal treatment for their mental illness. Approximately 3,000 Australians with dementia were confined to psychiatric wards in 1993 when the Burdekin inquiry reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has failed to address the specific needs of people with dementia. There has been a great deal of rhetoric but not much effective action. Insufficient and inflexible government funding and a failure to plan for the future are two of the main reasons for the government's failure in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators do not need to take my word for this. All they have to do is look at the evidence given to the Burdekin inquiry into human rights and mental illness, which clearly established that the elderly are often victims of discrimination in health services, either through abuse or neglect. The inquiry found that the appalling reality for many confused and sick older people is one of being physically restrained and/or sedated. Frequently their mental illness goes unrecognised and untreated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Managing dementia essentially consists of providing safe living arrangements where sufferers can maintain their remaining mental and social skills and can be protected as far as possible from events that make them anxious, confused, angry or frustrated. Providing safe living arrangements <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">can come in many forms. In the early stages of dementia this means support services in the community. In the later stages appropriate accommodation is often unavoidable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say at the outset that I strongly support the philosophy of enabling people with dementia to live in the community for as long as possible, as this environment provides the best opportunity for them to maintain a relatively normal and secure life. As I said, over 50 per cent of dementia sufferers are currently able to remain at home or in the community. This places an enormous burden on the carers. Senator Sandy Macdonald will be addressing that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I agree that many people who have mild dementia can be very appropriately integrated with other residents into nursing homes and hostels. However, those people who have dementia which involves severe behavioural disorders are not necessarily best suited to a hostel or nursing home with residents not afflicted in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dementia is progressive and irreversible, and in many cases dementia sufferers reach a stage where they are not able to be cared for in the community. To quote the Australian Alzheimer's Association submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into the home and community care program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need for dementia-specific services to assist some of those who have the most severe problems or complex needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Time and time again the government has failed to address especially the residential needs of those people with dementia who cannot be cared for in the community. Senator Newman will be addressing some of the problems facing the care of people with dementia in the home and community care program. The Burdekin inquiry reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to the approach advocated by many witnesses to the Inquiry, the Federal Government's current policy on institutional care for dementia sufferers is to integrate them in ordinary hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet evidence to the Burdekin inquiry consistently indicated that people with dementia in institutional care should be separated from people who are not cognitively impaired. People at every facility I visit, and I visit an enormous number, tell me that there are cases of people with dementia who are really best suited to dementia-specific facilities&mdash;not all, but especially those who have behavioural problems&mdash;not only for their own well-being but for the well-being of other residents whose rights also have to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give an example of a couple of letters that I have received. I receive innumerable letters because, as many people in this chamber know, it is an area in which I was interested before I came into politics, and people tend to write to me about it. The first is a letter from the Inverell Citizens Carers and Support Group&mdash;a group of citizens and health professionals. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that whilst a generous capital subsidy was provided by the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health to construct the 13 bed Dementia Specific Hostel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the government was encouraging it at this stage&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that owing to inadequate recurrent funding the facility is budgeting for a $35,000 loss per annum and have indicated they can only sustain such a loss for no more than 2 years as it requires cross subsidising from other sources of their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will result in people suffering with Alzheimers and related dementias being once again placed inappropriately in ordinary Hostels, Nursing Homes or at home. From our experiences this results in demented wanderers and those with behavioural problems being physically restricted or over medicated.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week, I visited five nursing homes in the Ballarat region with the member for the area, Michael Ronaldson; and every facility there said to me that there was a need for provision for people with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second letter is from a family at Wimmera. They say that the facilities in Wimmera for general aged care are excellent. However, their father, their brother, their grandfather&mdash;as they describe it, `Our husband, father, grandfather'&mdash;is not able to be accommodated in this facility. He is accommodated quite a distance away from them. In fact, they say it takes a round trip of 450 kilometres per visit per week with 75c per litre for fuel&mdash;now 79c per litre for fuel&mdash;to visit this relative in a dementia specific facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of thing that people in rural and remote communities face. They are the problems that exist. What I am saying today is that the treatment the government is giving, especially to dementia specific facilities, is not enough, and the little it has done is a little too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Important issue as this is, I am pretty disappointed&mdash;indeed, extremely disappointed&mdash;to see Senator Patterson or the opposition trying to point score on this matter, particularly as we are essentially horse trading with the care of the frail aged in our society. For the record, I will spend a few minutes explaining what this government has achieved since it came into office and then turn my remarks to the area that Senator Patterson is referring to today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that the government is unsympathetic to the need of elderly Australians, particularly frail old Australians, is absolutely stupid and ludicrous. When we came into office we took over a totally inadequate nursing home area lacking alternatives and lacking good nursing care, and with a funding structure that favoured people remaining perpetually in bed and so on. Over the years we have completely changed that with a dramatic increase in funding and a dramatic improvement in the services provided to people. We can never rest on our laurels and say that we have the perfect provision of services or the perfect balance. I think what Senator Patterson is doing today is making much of an area of imbalance and further work which this government is currently engaged in&mdash;significantly engaged in&mdash;as well as significantly expending dollars in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I think it is important to recognise that something like 10 per cent of Australians&mdash;and only 10 per cent of Australians&mdash;finish out their lives in nursing homes and hostels. That means that 90 per cent of old people live out their lives at home. Some of those living out their lives at home are frail aged, are perhaps even suffering from dementia and are cared for very lovingly by their families or relatives. But most of them are not. I certainly hope that Senator Patterson soon has a visit from the older women's network, who take her to task for suggesting that all older Australians might be catered for under the heading of demented or senile. No, they are not. While we need to make a case about the need of care for these people, I think it is important that we do not enlarge it or exaggerate it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that Senator Patterson said that. I am saying that we need to make sure we keep a balance. The older women's network is at pains to remind us that the majority of Australians live to a very old age&mdash;depending on how it is defined&mdash;and that the majority of Australians live lives that are not ever burdened with dementia or senility. It is important that we remember that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981 the Auditor-General concluded that there was absolutely inadequate financial accountability for nursing home funding and no guarantee of quality for residents. In 1985 the then Senator Pat Giles chaired a Senate select inquiry into private nursing homes and private hospitals and, in the nursing homes bit, concluded that the quality was very mixed. I served on that committee and remember very well its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the committee said that many of the articles on nursing homes painted a bleak and depressing picture of life in a nursing home. Some articles raised serious allegations about ill treatment or lack of care. In addition, allegations that private nursing home proprietors were making excessive profits at the expense of patients had become a common complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is now past history. The government has dealt with that but, I have to acknowledge, at that time the special needs of people with dementia were not singled out as any single category. I think they were included under all those people, mainly frail aged and often senile, in the provision of general nursing home care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see now is that the government is spending $2.7 billion on aged care. That is 170 per cent more than was spent in 1983-84. In real terms this represents a 61 per cent increase. That, of course, is much bigger than the 32 per cent estimated in the target population increase over the same time. Expenditure for community care services has also risen dramatically, from about $61.5 million in 1983-84 to $342 million in 1992-93. That is an increase of 450 per cent&mdash;a real increase in funding of over 230 per cent. I hope Senator Newman draws attention to those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on nursing homes is $1.7 billion, compared with only $0.8 billion when we came into office. It is important to recognise that a nursing home of 60 beds can expect to receive about $2 million in Commonwealth funding each year. What we have done is dramatically alter the balance of care in nursing homes and hostels, and in community care. That, I believe, cannot be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made sure that the arrangement of benefits and funding for nursing homes did not perpetuate the system that was there before, when the largest funding went to people who were confined to bed. It was a funding program that encouraged nursing homes to keep patients in bed because that was where the larger money came from. We have seen a very large difference in the assessment of the needs of people and funding according to the nursing needs and care that they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time there has been continuing discussion and debate between nursing homes and governments about upgrading facilities&mdash;a very important point. Some nursing homes, I suppose we could say, still are not contemporary buildings. I suspect that Senator Patterson has been to a lot of nursing home openings. I am not prepared to say it would be as many as I have, but possibly that is the case. We have certainly visited a very large number of them. I suspect that all the senators in the chamber at the moment have done that and could certainly talk about the changing standards of care, particularly in the physical building and bed arrangements, and the layouts and so on, that we have seen coming into existence over the last 10 years. A lot of that has gone on because the Labor government has spent $1.1 billion building nursing homes and hostels. That upgrading has been a very significant part of the improved care. The program provides residential care for 128,000 people in nursing homes and hostels; and about 215,000 people receive care under the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dollars are one thing; and Senator Patterson's point about dementia and best care for people with specific needs in nursing homes and hostels is very important. She suggests in this matter of public importance today that the government fails to understand that. I take serious issue with that. We do not fail to understand it; indeed, we understand it very well and are addressing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, firstly, established the assessment teams so that people are not unnecessarily placed in nursing homes. We have seen the extensive development of hostels, because hostel care is more than sufficient for many elderly people who perhaps cannot maintain themselves in the home they were previously used to but who certainly are not in need of the full care that might be provided by a nursing home. That is one of the first very significant changes&mdash;recognising a grading of care to match people's needs and certainly as much as possible assisting people to live in their homes in the community, where most people want to be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry if Senator Patterson was quoting Burdekin; I thought I could ascribe those remarks to her. She also went on to say that a difficulty of people with senility or dementia is that they are not really open to treatment; there is not very much in the way of specific treatment for their disorder. Treatment mainly consists of loving and caring support that assists every piece of capacity they have, rather than assisting in closing it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In nursing homes I have visited, people with dementia or senility would be asked in the morning, `Good morning, Mrs Smith. What day is it?' Mrs Smith, who did not know, was reminded how stupid she was again and again. That kind of practice has changed and these days people are told, `Good morning, Mrs Smith. Today is Wednesday.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps for many people this is not a significant change, but for people whose relatives are suffering from senility or for the people themselves, this very slight change focuses on care and extends the abilities and capacities of people instead of reducing them and making them feel stupid. That is the sort of change we see in our nursing care. That is also part of the recognition of the best way to assist people whose senility is developing. There is not much we can do to reverse it, but we can provide an opportunity for those people to have more normal rather than less normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research suggests&mdash;and I thought Senator Patterson said this&mdash;that people are much more assisted if they are amongst a community of people who are not also all suffering from dementia. One of Senator Patterson's arguments&mdash;I believe it is an important part of our program&mdash;is that, as much as possible, people suffering from dementia and senility are not isolated in separate specific purpose units. For very few people, it is sometimes necessary, particularly the cases that Senator Patterson has alluded to and that I have here&mdash;and they are the people who need to be confined for their own safety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It can generally be called behaviour but there are two areas of behaviour, one being difficult behaviour in a more localised or personal way and the other being the behaviour of wanting to wander or get out. The difficulty facing nursing homes is how they confine people with care. How do they restrict people for their own benefit and safety without effectively gaoling them in some kind of nursing home?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance between all those things is very much at the front of the government's mind and is why it has been funding very important research. That research builds on things like our introduction of user rights initiatives, where the people residing in nursing homes and hostels and their relatives can expect that the rights of those patients are paramount. That is a very significant change from what was in place when we first came into office. We have also focused specific care for people from non-English speaking backgrounds and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been some research done by Dr Richard Rosewarne. His evaluation of dementia care in hostels points out that dementia-specific services have not yet demonstrated any special value over dementia programs in mainstream services. So there is evidence that should qualify the suggestion that specific purpose dementia units are the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably what we need is a balance on individual assessment by wise and caring people and the flexibility within our aged care to provide that.

It will assist in identifying effective approaches to appropriate care. The successful tenderer will be identified in early October.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical profession has also become acutely aware of the need to develop specific care programs under geriatric services, probably an area of specific care that was not really developed or thought of before this government came to office. I do not want to ascribe it entirely to government, but there has been a very significant development, based on the appropriate care and also the ageing of the population and a recognition by this government of the need to integrate all sorts of services&mdash;medical services, nursing care, home and community care, and hostel and nursing home care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not do, I believe, to score broad points about government's failure to understand. The government does not fail to understand at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by disagreeing with Senator Crowley, although I acknowledge that the government has made improvements particularly in the quality of care for aged Australians. But we are looking today more specifically at the needs of people suffering with dementia and the volume and range of services in that area. However, as I read this proposition before us today I see that it gives me some flexibility. I will talk more generally about aged care services before specifically addressing the needs of those elderly Australians who have dementia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have travelled around South Australia I have come to look at in particular the range of aged care services and the use of inappropriate services because of the lack of general options, particularly home care options. I have not gained this information just by talking to those in hostels and nursing homes but also by talking to aged care assessment teams, to those responsible for HACC programs and in particular to those people responsible for running our public hospitals&mdash;those who are perhaps on the boards or are CEOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we see&mdash;and I have to emphasise that I am talking generally about South Australia and I am not looking interstate&mdash;that in most rural areas local communities are struggling to provide just basic services for people requiring aged care. Part of this goes back to the government's philosophy that we need a very large number of people in order to have a nursing home. Indeed, we are looking generally at 30 beds before permission is given to build a new nursing home service. That means that many people in rural Australia either have to move&mdash;and that means being cut off from family and friends&mdash;or have to put up with inappropriate placement in the local hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the cost of continuing to place older Australians in hospital care, we see that it is by far the most expensive option. It is more expensive than nursing homes, which is in turn more expensive than hostels, which in turn are far more expensive than being able to maintain people in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem is not just in rural South Australia&mdash;and here I particularly concentrate on the western suburbs of Adelaide where I live, where over 100 places are still needed for those who want hostel care, where it takes weeks to get an elderly relative on the list just to be showered at home, and where even Meals on Wheels is not an automatic certainty as, again, people have to put their names on the list to be certain that they will be able to access that service as required. Any sort of respite care there is almost unobtainable&mdash;and I am not particularly looking at care for those with dementia. While I acknowledge the government's improvement in the quality of care, and particularly what it has done for the rights and responsibilities of people in nursing homes and hostels, we certainly have a major problem with the actual availability of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look specifically at the community care problems and the options&mdash;and I acknowledge that the aged care packages are a very welcome innovation&mdash;we see that the government is simply wasting money by pushing people into the most expensive option of ending up in hospital beds. It is also pushing relatives and friends to the brink where indeed we might have not one but two older Australians in need of care because the respite facilities are simply not there. People in the nursing homes that I have spoken to about their respite services tell me that they need months and months of planning to know that people will be going into hospital or perhaps will be sick so that their elderly relatives can have some respite care. Indeed, there have been incidents where both the patient and the elderly person have turned up at hospital with bags packed as that is the only option for people needing to go into hospital for an operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look quickly at the fact that the number of frail elderly people is increasing, and the minister acknowledges this. We have the statistics already. We know what we should be planning for, but that planning is very slow. There is a high rate of admission to hospital for these elderly people. They represent a high proportion of the users of hospital services and therefore are very high users of our health resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health services for these people will become increasingly important over the next five years. The Commonwealth and states in particular need to sort out who is doing what because the duplication, the crossing over of services and the lack of services for some people while others can tap into two or three different services are major problems&mdash;and, again, I concentrate on my home state. There is far too much confusion, duplication, administrative inefficiency and cost shifting between the states and the Commonwealth. I look at what the government in my state is doing. It says that it will reduce the cost of running its hospitals, when most of that reduced cost is simply being passed straight on to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly acknowledge what the previous minister for aged, family and health services, Mr Staples, did in the area of quality programs. But it is one-sided to set a very high quality for some older Australians and to leave others, particularly those with dementia, without any support and particularly without support for their relatives and friends. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two initiatives that the Democrats are proposing. Firstly, there is the extension of the personal care tax rebate. That is expanding the eligibility criteria for the medical expenses rebate to people providing personal care at home for a friend or relative with moderate to severe dementia. At present these carers are not eligible for the rebate, despite incurring significant medical and care costs. I stress again that this is the cheapest option for government. These people are saving the Commonwealth huge amounts of money by caring for relatives at home. Let us give them some additional incentives and, in particular, some real support. We also need to see an increase in the home and community care program and again a sorting out with the states to make sure that the states are matching the money that is being put in. I do not know how we will do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to look at increasing home nursing services, and not just in this area. This is particularly important as states move to case mix funding because one of the most vulnerable groups in the community as we move to case mix is elderly Australians who may not have that level of support they need at home. They may need nursing care for far longer than the hospital is able to provide. Indeed, some suggestions are that they will need that nursing care for four times the length of time that a traditional, fit, middle-aged Australian will need that level of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will shorten my remarks to enable Senator Chamarette to speak for a brief three minutes. My final comment is that we acknowledge this government's improvement in the quality of services, but the amount of money put into this area is barely  keeping up with the existing level of need. It is not coping. It is not realistically planning for the future that we know is ahead of us when more and more Australians will fall into the group needing a range of services as the population ages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance before the Senate. I am particularly concerned that the speech by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, was simply a litany of statistics. She barely mentioned people at all. If ever there was a need for an understanding of the effect on people it is in this area of aged care, and especially those suffering Alzheimer's disease. The minister was obviously dealing with a departmental brief and statistics seemed to be the only concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also complained about the opposition scoring political points. I remind the Senate that our job as an opposition is to hold the government accountable on behalf of the Australian people. There can be no more vulnerable group of Australian people than those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on the policy failings of the government in relation to the home and community care scheme, HACC, and its effectiveness in addressing the needs of people suffering dementia and their carers. The scheme was established a decade ago and the existence of the program has been supported by the coalition since its inception; nevertheless, for a long time there has been a real concern not just by us but by many people at the coalface that the program has not been nearly as effective as it could be. Senator Lees referred to that in passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow minister for community services and aged care, Dr Wooldridge, has highlighted the weaknesses and failings of the program, just as did his predecessor Senator Kay Patterson, just as I did myself when I was the shadow minister, and as Mr Jim Carlton did before me. The problems with the HACC program have been evident for a very long time and the government has failed to address them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the minister said that the government was instituting a research program on something or other. The time for research programs is over. There has been report after report after report, the most recent of which was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not Alone</EMPHASIS> from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs in July this year. What we need is action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems can be summarised as: a lack of clear objectives underlying the program; the failure to define the client groups it is intended to address; duplication and confusion between Commonwealth, state and local governments; a lack of effective strategic planning and outcomes standards; and insufficient and inadequate information and advice services available for consumers and carers. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs produced a comprehensive report advocating substantial change in a number of areas, including those that I have just highlighted and that the coalition highlighted previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Dr Wooldridge put it, the report is a `chronicle of a program which has lost its way'. That means that people who use its services, including aged people, are not being served as well as they could be. For people suffering dementia, a lack of adequate home and community care may mean the difference between being supported in the community and being institutionalised in a nursing home or dementia specific facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence to the committee notes that most people with dementia who receive assistance do so through mainstream HACC services. The issue is: are they adequate? A study conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales on the effectiveness of a program called `community options' established under HACC bears out this point. The study involved a 12-month follow up on the `community options' program. It found that clients who left the program to enter residential care were older, more likely to be women, to have an informal care giver, and to have a diagnosis of dementia. Importantly, it also found that there was no clear cut relationship between clients' level of dependency and their movement to residential care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This implicitly suggests that a dementia patient, for instance, with a high level of dependency need not necessarily have to move to residential care if support services are adequate. The crucial factor will be the quality of support services and it is in this area that HACC is failing. The government is failing in this area; its policy has not caught up with the realities and with the needs of those with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of particular concern is that of respite care, and my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald will have more to say on that issue shortly. I would like to make a couple of brief points. The first point is that the nature of dementia is such that it often requires a very substantial investment in time and patience by those caring for dementia sufferers. For example, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs highlighted the following evidence from a carer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They need 36 hour care . . . because they need constant supervision. It is like having an uncooperative teenager in an adult body. Often the carers are aging themselves. I know people in their eighties who are struggling to care for their partner. It is almost impossible.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee pointed out that more flexible and innovative respite care policy is needed and recommended action with specific reference to those caring for people with dementia. The need for reform is clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter I wish to mention specifically is the bar on many services being provided to people in retirement villages, non-government hostels and supported accommodation. It is discriminatory, it is based on ideology and it is unfair. When a couple have made arrangements for their retirement in a home that suits them they should not be debarred from assistance if one of the partners needs support&mdash;for example, with the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There needs to be a focus on providing individualised, comprehensive services which are interwoven with the family-provided services. It could include coordination of care and support for informal carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a recognition of the value and importance of volunteers. All too often volunteers are praised in speeches and then rejected as being unable to make an important contribution to the care of the aged. I can only assume that the ACTU, and therefore the Labor Party, does not like volunteerism&mdash;all too often we hear that volunteers take the place of those wanting work&mdash;but if the nation cannot find the cash to provide the care needed so that care is not given at all, who benefits? It is certainly not the unemployed and it is certainly not those with Alzheimer's or their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average time from onset to death from Alzheimer's disease is approximately nine to 10 years, with many sufferers spending half that time in institutionalised care. If existing services to support people in their homes cannot cope, dementia specific services should be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern is the special need of older migrants for home based aged care. At the coalition's national family conference last May, Professor Trang Thomas, the ethnic affairs commissioner for Victoria, said that there was a misconception in the wider community that the needs of older migrants could or would be met by their own people. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> report also drew attention to the lack of appropriate support for younger people with dementia and the need for services for people in the early stages of dementia. </PARA>

I remind Senator Newman that one of the major reasons that we are sitting on the government side is because we are a government with policies and a government that cares about people. One of the reasons why Senator Newman is still sitting on the other side of the chamber is because at the last election the opposition went to the people with a policy based purely on statistics&mdash;a policy based upon cutting health funds and slashing the services provided for aged care and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address my remarks to that part of the proposition before the Senate that refers to people suffering from dementia. In the short time available I would like to outline some of the detailed programs and policies that this government has implemented to deal with what is recognised as a serious problem in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 budget the government announced the national action plan, a major program with total funding of over $30 million&mdash;a program which has a very broad scope. It incorporates grants for projects demonstrating innovative service provision for people with dementia. It incorporates counselling services, information services and support for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the national action plan, the announcement in this year's budget of $12.4 million for psychogeriatric units was the culmination of consultations and deliberations with a wide range of groups. It clearly represents this government's commitment to providing additional expertise and support to care for people with dementia and very challenging behaviours. A range of organisations and groups were consulted in bringing about that policy position. Carers, families, organisations and industry groups were all consulted. Of course, regard was had to Brian Burdekin's report in which he suggested that nursing homes and hostels are in need of increased expert assistance for people suffering from dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $12.4 million will be used over the next four years to help meet the psychological health needs of elderly people in residential care. The initiative builds upon the national action plan previously announced. The initiative has two components. The first, as has been mentioned, is the establishment of specialist psychogeriatric care units staffed by people with expert knowledge and experience in the provision of that care, and working with established aged care assessment teams. The second component relates to research, as the minister stated earlier. It is a research project which has been developed in consultation with Aged Care Australia. So when those opposite make assertions that we do not consider people, we are in fact consulting the very organisations that represent the people in need in this respect. That research project will investigate the various care options available for people with severe dementia and identify those elements which are successful in meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vital part of the national action plan relates to the training of workers involved in community care. As has been recognised, about half of the people with severe dementia live in the community with a combination of support from informal carers such as family and friends and formal services provided through home and community care funded agencies. The quality of the formal care is crucial to the quality of life of those people suffering from dementia. It has been recognised as an essential part of the national action plan that training for community care providers be improved and be made available on a wider basis. Under that plan, $115,000 has already been spent to develop a dementia care learning program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Lees for sparing me three precious minutes of her time. I will touch on two issues that are relevant to this topic. Firstly, the emerging thesis of age as a rationale for health care is a thesis that actually debases old age at a time when it should be affirmed. I will expand on this in the adjournment debate. Secondly, I want to look at the issue of the roles of carers in the health debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the impact of age as a rationale for health care, giving the aged poor their pension and providing them with medical care is at the very least a prerequisite for their self-respect and dignity but it is not a sufficient condition. More importantly, it is the manner of the giving that counts and the moral basis on which it is given. Propositions such as these undermine respect and dignity as components of a moral society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If age becomes a limiting factor in the provision of medical treatment, apart from the obvious appalling consequences to which many people have already taken objection, the consequences for women cannot be under-estimated. I think this gender issue in relation to the facilities being provided to aged people in our community is a very important one. Not only are there many more elderly women than men, but these older women are poorer, more apt to live alone and less likely to have informal social and personal supports than their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, a disproportionate number of nursing home patients are women. The use of an age criterion for determining how to allocate health care resources seems to manifest society's perception that youth is valuable and advanced age, particularly female age, has less worth. We need to look at the differential impact of this on women in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to carers and their needs, the issue of caring is emerging as another issue that will affect the lives of women enormously. Carers are one of the least visible underclasses of our society. They continue to bridge the gap between what is provided and what is actually needed with little reward or recognition. The government has not sufficiently addressed the budget allocations for this very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we all start to ask who will care for us as we age and who we will care for, the reality of caring cannot be adequately resolved.

I particularly commend both of them on their contribution today on this important MPI. Today we are focused on the needs of older Australians, particularly those suffering dementia. We must remember that we are dealing with people and the way that people live their lives. We should not be preoccupied with programs, categories and placing people in little boxes. This government seems preoccupied with putting people in a box and giving it a label.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a pressing need to recognise and address this increasingly important area of the care and welfare of the aged. If a nation cannot look after the old and infirm then who can it look after? We are talking about a generation that gave us the prosperity of the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s and who are now at the age where Australians should acknowledge a greater responsibility for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great pleasures that I have found&mdash;and I am sure I share it with a number of other honourable senators&mdash;is meeting the incredibly wide range of decent and selfless Australians carrying out a service for their fellows without great or in fact frequently no financial reward. This is part of the uniqueness of this country, part of the uniqueness of being Australian. None fit into this category better than those who work in nursing homes and hospitals caring for the extended stay aged patients, and for the carers who look after the elderly in their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The valuable contribution carers make to Australian society saves the nation an estimated $24 billion a year because about 50 per cent of dementia sufferers are cared for at home. The rapidly growing number of home carers for older Australians suffering with dementia is not sufficiently understood nor being addressed by this government and this situation can only intensify. It can only intensify because over the next three decades the number of elderly people in Australia will grow at twice the rate of the population as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a quarter of our population is presently over 50 years of age, by the year 2021, which is not very far away, this will increase to one-third. The fastest growing sector will be those over 85 years: in 2021 there will be three times as many people aged over 85 as there are today. Without home carers the community would not be able to support the growing number of elderly people suffering from dementia. The problem will only become worse as the decades go past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid to say that the recognition of this role of carers is sadly lacking. Provision for carers to take a break from this sometimes highly stressful and full-time work is totally inadequate. Senator Patterson pointed out that these dedicated workers from respite care are often the lifesavers of home carers, but they can only do so much. Extra funding is urgently needed, as has been pointed out already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to information, services and emotional support is also overlooked. The home carer's role is undervalued, unpaid, unrecognised and ignored. It is also true to say that the carers themselves are growing older and, in many ways, this places unrealistic burdens on their shoulders. Also true is the fact that the home carers&mdash;70 per cent of whom are women&mdash;have in many cases had to give up a job, which has caused social isolation and a deterioration in physical and psychological health. Carers who are out of the work force for a long time lose their skills and confidence. The sandwich effect&mdash;when carers are caught up between caring for their children and their elderly and infirmed relations&mdash;makes it very difficult for carers to return to the work force when they eventually have the chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out, some carers work a 36-hour day&mdash;and I mean a 36-hour day&mdash;and have not had respite from their responsibility for years. Statistics show that over a third have never been absent from their responsibilities for more than four hours. This raises the issue of the health and well-being of carers. It is not possible for people with caring responsibilities to sustain their own emotional and physical health if they do not have reasonable breaks and adequate support. One of the biggest issues in easing the burden on carers is communication. Just knowing that someone else is aware of the problems and willing to listen and talk about them is an enormous help. The use of phone links should be encouraged&mdash;even the sound of another voice is incredibly helpful sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the frail and elderly are not shunted off to nursing homes until they die. It is important that they receive adequate care in their homes if appropriate. But this care has a human cost, a cost that goes seemingly unrecognised in our society. This is particularly so in this age of the nuclear family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the stories that have been mentioned today in the Senate show the incredible pain that some of these carers go through. In one of the letters that I have seen, the carer was asked how she coped in the beginning. She replied, `With great difficulty.' She had been told, `It will get worse,' and it did. She said that the pain as she looked into her husband's face filled her with sadness and confusion. It certainly was not the retirement that they had planned. They were both 60 years of age. I conclude by asking the government to mark the International Year of the Family as a year when this vital area of older Australians is sympathetically treated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Patterson for providing the opportunity to discuss the issue of aged care. As all honourable senators would agree, aged care is becoming an increasingly important issue in our community with the increasing age of Australia's population. This year 11.7 per cent of our population are aged 65 or more. By the year 2001, this will increase to 12 per cent&mdash;that is about 2 1/2 million people.

I have had personal experience dealing with an older person who has lost the experience and wisdom with age, rather than having this increase as one is entitled to expect. These people often lose contact with their relatives and the community which they grew up in through this terrible disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge facing the federal government is to provide an adequate level of care but at the same time to recognise and give the fullest support for methods of maintaining the ongoing independence and dignity of the individuals affected. To help meet this challenge the federal government has implemented the home and community care program, which is particularly concerned with the residential, home and community care of the frail aged, including those suffering from dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HACC program was introduced in 1985 in response to a variety of reports which recommended a change in balance between institutional and community-based services for the aged and disabled. The experiences and opinions of the persons actually affected, the aged, have had a major influence over the resulting scheme. The report emphasised that there should be a correction of the imbalance between institutional and community care which was leading to premature or unnecessary admission to institutional care with a consequential loss of quality of life; the expansion of the types of care available to individuals; the improvement of the assessment of individuals for care; and an increase in the total resources available for care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators that have had an interest in aged care would remember that prior to the implementation of this program there were four disparate and fragmented schemes in operation, schemes that clearly did not adequately deal with the needs of frail elderly members of the community. It is worth noting that the stopgap schemes were all introduced by coalition governments. Each of them had worthy intentions in their introduction and implementation but, under Australia's coalition governments over the years, there has never been a serious attempt to address the entire field of aged care and dementia services. The only government to review this entire field, and to put in place policies covering every aspect of aged care, is this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 the Hawke government began a thorough analysis of Australia's aged care services. This review led to the establishment of the home and community care program. HACC is a program operating through cost sharing with the states and territories. Financial assistance is provided through HACC for services to support frail aged persons and those with a disability living at home who are at risk of premature or inappropriate admission to long-term residential care. The program also aims to provide support for their carers. That means that frail aged people can stay longer in their homes, maintaining their dignity, their independence and their contacts with their families and communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated objective of the HACC program is to `enhance the quality of life of the frail aged and younger people with a disability and their carers, by providing high quality and cost-effective care in the community'. Appropriate services are provided according to the assessed needs of the individual, with services targeted to avoid the poor direction and accuracy of HACC's predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve these objectives the federal government has been pursuing the following objectives: the provision of a comprehensive and well-integrated range of basic support services for the frail aged; help for these people to assist them to be more independent at home and to more easily be able to live their own lives, thus reducing the impact of their frailty or illness on their daily lives and therefore avoiding the risk of inappropriate admission to residential care; and a greater range of services and more flexible service provision to ensure that services respond to the needs of the users. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth funding for the Vocational Education and Training sector for the years 1994 and 1995 has already been appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for supplementation to these amounts in line with price movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also appropriates funding for 1996, in accordance with the Commonwealth's undertaking in the Heads of Government Agreement to establish the Australian National Training Authority to provide triennial funding for the vocational education and training sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1996 also sees further evidence of the Government's commitment to expansion of the vocational education and training sector through the provision of a further $70m in growth funds. This brings total growth funding since 1993 to $1.1 billion. The Commonwealth, in turn, expects States and Territories to honour their undertakings in the ANTA Agreement including maintaining their own effort in vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also provides funding ($25.9m from 1994, including $2.4m for monitoring purposes) to ANTA for support for off-the-job training provider assistance under the Australian Traineeship System, Career Start Traineeships and National Training Wage Traineeships, including assistance for both public and private training providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Government announced in the White Paper, we are committed to the task of achieving 50,000 additional entry-level training places by 1995-96. An integral part of this is achieving an additional 16,000 trainees in that time. In 1995 and 1996, an additional $12.8m and $22.7m respectively is available for this purpose. When this is combined with the $70m growth funds that the Government is providing in each of 1995 and 1996, as well as the transitional funding of $20.4m in 1994 and $10.0m in 1995 provided in the Budget, the Government expects these costs to be more than adequately met. The Government expects ANTA to report separately each year on progress towards achieving a target of 35,000 trainees by 1995-96, under the $2.4m being provided to monitor these grants. The bill provides that these additional funds will only go to those States and Territories that are able to demonstrate to ANTA that they have achieved additional trainees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also adjusts funding to ANTA from July 1994 to allow the ACT to enter the national infrastructure program for vocational education and training. This places the ACT on the same footing as all other States and Territories in terms of national planning for vocational education and training facilities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major amendments proposed by the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill will allow Abstudy and Austudy recipients who receive a benefit during 1995 or a later year to repay the whole or any part of that benefit at any time during the year. In addition, it will make the Austudy-Abstudy loan supplement available to those students from 1995 who do not qualify for the Austudy-Abstudy benefits because of the spouse income test, provided the spouses income is less than the prescribed amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Students Assistance Act 1973, which is the principal act, provides for the payment of benefits under the Austudy and Abstudy schemes and the provision of loan supplements for tertiary students. These are subject to income and assets tests. The Austudy scheme provides living allowances to students undertaking full-time secondary and tertiary education. The Abstudy scheme aims to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in secondary and tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loan supplement was introduced on 1 January 1993 and is open to students who qualify for benefits under the Austudy or Abstudy schemes or who would so qualify on a parental income test. Eligible tertiary students can obtain an interest free loan from a participating financial institution to increase the level of assistance beyond that provided under the Austudy or Abstudy schemes. Supplement loans are paid to students in fortnightly instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points that needs to be recognised when debating student assistance matters is the great need in Australia for people living outside university cities and towns to access tertiary education. In the past, reports have been tabled in this parliament about the workings of Austudy and some of the difficulties faced by people in this regard. People still complain about the anomalies of the system, about the inequities and the lack of justice. This is particularly so in the case of people in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government claims that it is advocating that Australia become the clever country, yet it has placed major financial hurdles in the way of students being able to access educational opportunities. When we look at this legislation and some of the hurdles, the question arises, `Who is really disadvantaged by this legislation?' It is those who are least able to afford to meet the enormous costs of sending students to upper secondary institutions, particularly tertiary institutions&mdash;in other words, the students and the parents of the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the maximum entitlements under Austudy do not go far when paying for books and fees such as HECS. It is difficult enough for students and parents in urban areas. However, for students in rural areas the situation is even more critical. I believe that the government has been very tardy as it has not provided the same access to higher education for rural and regional young people that urban young people have available. The government owes it to all Australians, particularly to rural people who make up the backbone of this continent, to revise the whole Austudy scheme to make it equitable and just. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that Austudy needs to be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that student financial assistance is available on an equitable basis for all. It also believes that the targeting of student financial assistance based on grants needs to be improved to ensure that grants are not made to those who are not in financial need and are made to those who are in financial need, in particular in the current times with the very severe drought in Australia. We in the coalition are very concerned about the effect of this drought on rural people. A lot of people are being hurt by this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, I give notice to the Senate that I intend to move an amendment at the committee stage which will allow the government, in exceptional circumstances, to remove the assets test&mdash;providing a declaration is made by the minister. We believe the amendment being circulated in my name is more appropriate than the one the Australian Democrats are intending to move, essentially because we believe it has a better chance of being more targeted than the amendment which they are proposing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill will amend the Student Assistant Act 1973 to allow for this year's budget changes. This so-called simplification of the repayment of benefits will generate, it is claimed, savings of some $6 million per year. This is a large saving for the government in comparison with the amount this bill spends on assistance. This bill extends the student loan scheme, otherwise known as the financial supplement, to those students not eligible for Austudy because of the spouse income test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The student loans scheme was introduced in 1992 after a heated and controversial debate. Students, progressive minded educationalists and community members opposed that scheme on the grounds that it would lead to an erosion in the level of the grants available to students under the Abstudy and Austudy schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who opposed the introduction of student loans in this country, including the Democrats, did so on the grounds that it would be only a matter of time before the level of loans increased and the government would begin to rely on those loans as a means of raising revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While economic rationalists laughed at the idea of the thin end of the wedge&mdash;one argument proffered by student representatives&mdash;it was only a short period before this was proven to be true. Changes to student assistance announced in the 1994 budget include an increase in the amount that students can take out in a loan form. I do not hesitate to say to the minister, `I told you so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the scheme was first introduced, students eligible for the scheme could take out $6,000 in loans; that is, they could trade in their Austudy grant for double the amount in a loan form or could apply, assuming that they met the criteria outlined in the parental income test of $50,000 per annum. Only two years later this has been changed from the $6,000 I mentioned to $8,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in this bill which allows students who fail to qualify for Austudy or Abstudy due to the spouse income test to have access to the loans scheme will cost $0.21 million and $0.4 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have fought hard for the spouse income test to be reduced so that deserving applicants can obtain Austudy payments without the artificial barriers of their spouses' income. Needless to say, it should be obvious and apparent to all that it is usually women who are disadvantaged in this situation, based as it is on the assumption that women have equal access to their spouses' incomes&mdash;an assumption that is both faulty and insulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decision to decrease the spouse income test level three years ago was a regressive and discriminatory move. The effects of that move are not at all lessened by this decision to make loans available. While we are forcing people to take out loans to be able to undertake tertiary education, the government is congratulating itself on having forced people into that situation and then extending the amount that people can borrow. That is a cause for shame rather than self-congratulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, those who choose to take out a loan will be forced to repay two educational debts&mdash;first their HECS or other university fees and then the loan supplement. Once again, research has quite easily demonstrated that women are the worse off when it comes to this debt repayment. Women are five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debt by the age of 30 and could still be paying off their HECS debts well into their 40s and 50s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's aim of extending the net of those who are eligible for the loans scheme is simply a way of ensuring increased revenue gains for the government. If the government was intent on assisting those students and families in need, it would widen the eligibility criteria so that they were fairer and it would increase the level of benefits so that students were not forced to live substantially below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to simplify the rules regarding repayment of the loan. This simplifying relating to the payment of benefits is expected to raise $6 million in revenue. This forces us to question the government's motives in regard to these changes. Nevertheless, if a student repays an amount during the year he or she obtained that amount in the loan form, it is considered never to have been loaned. That is at least reasonable and helpful. Thus the debt for that amount is wiped, with no CPI adjustments required. We support and acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we move to other problems. Only this week we have seen students protesting outside Parliament House against the unfair Austudy regulations. Students have voiced their concerns about the restrictive nature of the eligibility criteria and inadequate levels of the actual payments. Students also pointed out something that the Democrats have been talking about for some time, and that is that the definition of the independent rate age is in fact ridiculous and can withstand no scrutiny whatsoever. Firstly, it assumes that all students under the age of 22 are reliant upon their parents for income. This goes against commonsense and what I would suggest any experienced person knows about people in that age bracket. We should also challenge the notion that young people, even those living at home, can expect that their parents would be willing or able to assist them financially while they study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have asked repeatedly: why is it that young people can partake in a range of activities&mdash;such as legally consuming alcohol; marrying; being in charge of a motor vehicle; voting in federal, state and local government elections; entering into financial contracts; and joining the armed forces and laying down their lives for their country&mdash;and yet cannot expect to be treated as independent for the purposes of student financial assistance when in fact they are demonstrably independent, adult and, in all senses of the word, no longer dependent upon their parents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the facts demonstrate that such people are no longer dependent upon their parents, this government deems that they are. The government goes against the facts of the matter and deems that people are in this situation. In other words, we have created a second class of citizens&mdash;a class of citizens who are deemed to be in a certain situation and are deemed to have certain qualities about them contrary to the facts. That is what is most offensive about this: contrary to the facts people can be deemed to be dependent upon their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, sometimes it is not even their parents whose incomes and assets are taken into account. Honourable senators would be shocked to learn of, say, a young person at the age of 21 who has been living away from the parental home for perhaps 18 months and is no longer associated with the parental address which is now occupied by one parent and a de facto, with perhaps the other parent either dead or overseas. This is not too far removed from actual case studies that have been brought to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of one instance where such a young person, 21 years of age, having had two different jobs, having lived away from home and having married was deemed to be dependent upon his mother and her partner at the time. The income and assets of that partner, whom that young person has never met, were taken into account in assessing that young person's eligibility for Austudy payments. I think that is contrary to commonsense and contrary to how real life situations are. We think that these situations exist solely because the government is willing and eager to cut costs and overlook its responsibility towards proper funding for higher education and makes decisions contrary to the practical real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill the Democrats are challenging the commitment of the government and the opposition to student assistance and, in a very real sense, we will test their commitment to rural families. I foreshadow that we will move an amendment to this bill which will remove the tools of trade from the assets test for rural families. We will do that in the committee stage. </PARA>

The government always claims that. It will be beneficial only to those who apply and who are eligible to undertake tertiary studies. There has been this myth perpetrated before during discussion on this matter that somehow or other everybody over the age of 16 will suddenly be getting Austudy sent into their bank accounts. That is a stupid attitude to adopt because Austudy is available for tertiary studies; it is not paid just to buy more ice-creams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment we are proposing is about fairness and about offering equal opportunities. We recognise that the key role of student financial assistance is ensuring that people have equality of access to education. Unfortunately, this government has erected so many other financial barriers to education, some of which have come to our attention this week in parliament&mdash;the inadequate nature of the Austudy scheme, the rising fees for postgraduate courses, the possible introduction of up-front administration charges, differential HECS and up-front full cost fees under the resource allocation paper proposals.

These changes will allow students to repay Austudy and Abstudy benefits at a time during the year in order to maximise their eligibility for a supplementary loan, and will make supplementary loans available to students who do not qualify for Austudy or Abstudy because of the spouse income test if the spouse income is less than $35,000 a year in 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps we did misunderstand it, but I am glad to see that the policy of the Australian Democrats has evolved a little since that time. I was a little bemused by the way in which Senator Bell wanted to redefine an assets test. He mentioned tools of trade as being an exemption. That is fair enough, but I do not know whether that is going to go a great distance towards solving the problems of rural families. The real problem is that rural families have an asset which might be worth a considerable amount of money but, as we are finding in this drought situation, it may not be generating very much money for them. Indeed, as I pointed out yesterday in taking note of an answer by Senator Collins, they may not have any money at all; they might have a negative cash flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems incredibly cruel for a government to require people who have virtually no income&mdash;asset rich though they may be&mdash;to be excluded from access. That is why the coalition is very keen to see that, in certain circumstances where people are facing real hardship in the bush, they have greater access. We find that the present assets test on farmers includes more than Senator Bell indicated; it includes land, farm machinery, and livestock, and it gives no indication of ability to pay. People in cities may be able to access Austudy, but people in the country cannot because they do not have this income producing stream. High asset levels do not necessarily produce big incomes. </PARA>

<PARA>Madam Acting Deputy President, I would like to speak very briefly on Industry Commission report No. 39 on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industry. As the Senate would know, the Australian Democrats would probably not be regarded as any great friend of the tobacco industry but I must say that after spending some days in north Queensland and talking to tobacco growers at their request, I had a much better understanding of the situation they face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we do not resile from our opposition to the tobacco industry, we have been made aware of the problems facing those growers who, because of the recommendations of the Industry Commission and the actions of the government, are now facing a real problem with regard to their future. They need to make the change from tobacco growing but the question remains: what will they move into?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already indicated that. The government's policy, which is supported by the opposition, to reduce the obligation on Australian tobacco manufacturers to have 50 per cent Australian leaf content in cigarettes and other tobacco products manufactured in Australia will eventually force the complete closing down of the tobacco industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are concerned for the future of those growers and their families who need to move into alternative products. We want to see the government making provision for them. In the press release of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), which came out at the same time as this report, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impending termination of the current industry assistance arrangements together with 35 per cent reduction in marketing quotas over the past two years has introduced major adjustment pressures.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather nice way of saying that the tobacco-growing industry in Australia is closing down. I am concerned with seeing that we put in place enough time and sufficient support for tobacco growers in north Queensland and Victoria to switch to other crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on record the fact that the Australian Democrats support those growers who want to shift. I also place on record my appreciation of the very thorough briefing I received from people in the north Queensland area&mdash;such as Remzi Muller, Chris Lewis, the mayor of the Shire of Mareeba, and Fred Cattarossi&mdash;who helped us to understand the pressures that they face. I also place on record our urging for the government to make such provision for these growers that would enable them to switch to the growing of other crops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on the Industry Commission report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industry. For years now, the government has actively pursued policies in support of a special sector of domestic agriculture and a special sector of manufacturing. Its general policy thrust has been to let domestic industries die rather than support them in any way, even when they are competing with heavily supported imports. So what is this special, most favoured industry? It is not basic food or other basic needs; it is tobacco.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is currently conducting strong health campaigns against tobacco smoking. Given the number of deaths and debilitating illnesses involved, this is understandable. What is not explicable is why there has been this history of great concern to support a domestic tobacco industry while every other industry except the arms trade has been left to sink or swim. But the government is finally moving to abandon the Australian tobacco industry to death by market forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most imported tobacco products pay a tariff at a rate equivalent to excise payments. This is currently about $67 a kilo. Duties also include a protectionist component. The commission has reported that essentially we have a domestic tobacco industry based on concessional tariffs for tobacco imports, with companies that have over 50 per cent Australian content getting concessional tariff reductions of 47c a kilo instead of $1 to $2 a kilo, and special mechanisms to ensure that tobacco products made here have 57 per cent Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission suggests that this should not be sustained and the tobacco industry should be put on a competitive basis. It states that this will probably mean an end to domestic production. Although it notes some of the problems facing Australian growers and seems to support some type of adjustment program for them, it falls short of any actual recommendations to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primary recommendations appear to be the demise of concessional duties. It suggests that all other non-tariff support be eliminated and then, with the demise of the TISP or LLCS, the general tariff rate on all tobacco leaf products goes to 25 per cent on an ad valorem basis rather than a tariff on a weight basis. The 25 per cent will then be phased down to five per cent. All manufactured products will go to five per cent immediately on the demise of TISP or LLCS, that is, on or before 30 September 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the area in which the Greens have a strong objection to the recommendations. The current weight based system works well and the current tariff level is designed to be a disincentive to smoking rather than a tariff barrier. As the report notes on pages 90 and 91, while taxes increased, revenue decreased due to reduced sales. In this case we do not have a big problem with the demise of a concessional rate which acts as an industry support. We object, however, to any change which would effectively reduce the cost of smoking. We believe that the recommendations for a reduction to an ad valorem five per cent tariff constitutes such a reduction and that the fact that state taxes are mainly ad valorem means that the reduction would have a multiplier effect. If a state tax is set at 100 per cent, a reduction of 30c at import level would translate into a reduction of 60c. The indication from the current rates is that the reduction would be at least that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have objections to the ad valorem method in principle, as do the industry and health groups. Our concern, like that of health groups, is that an ad valorem system at federal level, added to ad valorem taxes at other levels, would simply create a strong differential between cheap and expensive cigarettes. In addition, the commission notes that under the current weight based federal system one effect is that manufacturers seek to lower costs by lowering tobacco content, either by making cigarettes smaller or by using non-tobacco fillers. This is not a bad outcome from a health perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue is that while the report includes adjustment for tobacco growers as an issue in both its findings and in chapter 8, it does not make any recommendations on this issue. We feel that the issue is an important one and must be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, these documents were tabled only this afternoon and I have not had the opportunity to read the great number of pages in the Industry Commission report. Hopefully, I will have the opportunity at some later date to speak on the report at much greater length. While I do not want to canvass the recommendations of the Industry Commission at this time, I do want to alert the Senate to the difficulties being faced, particularly by the Mareeba community, following a series of reductions in assistance from governments over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mareeba is a community on the Atherton Tablelands west of Cairns. For many decades now it has been a very progressive and modern community with all facilities and, until recently, an expanding population. But, because of the difficulties in which the tobacco industry finds itself, it is now a town that is really struggling. Like every other rural town in Australia, it has suffered considerably from the recession that the Australian Labor Party planned and that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, told us we had to have. But it has suffered more because other industries which the community was relying upon have not reached the fruition that was hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A rice industry was established in the Mareeba area in a way that was intended to cushion the effects of the reduction in the protection of the tobacco industry but, unfortunately, that industry along with the Burdekin rice industry failed, so that opportunity is no longer available to the community. There are attempts to grow sugarcane in parts of the Atherton Tablelands and in parts served by the township of Mareeba but, unfortunately again, the soils in the Mareeba area are not universally conducive to the growing of sugar. In those places where sugar can be grown it grows very successfully and is providing good incomes to the growers, although they have to send it down the range to the Mossman mill for crushing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community itself has all the facilities: a very progressive council and a very progressive chamber of commerce and industry group who, I am pleased to say, met with my Senate colleagues on a recent trip organised to that town. That community, its business community in particular, is very aware of the problems confronting the industry and is trying to do something about it. It has investigated a number of alternative crops, even to the extent of looking at rheum trees from which some very interesting chemicals can be derived. A lot of work has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community needs more than understanding from the government; it needs some support in adjusting to the reduction and, I regret to say, the ultimate end of the tobacco industry in that particular town. So the Senate should do its part to help the Mareeba community adjust to the finish of the tobacco industry in the area. There are many ways. Representatives of the chamber of commerce who spoke to myself and my colleagues during the recent trip to the town indicated that they, like all other Australians, were suffering quite considerably from the taxes that this government continues to add&mdash;the excise on fuel, the petrol tax at 33c a litre which severely impacts on rural communities like that, the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxes that this government keeps imposing impact very heavily on rural communities. So I urge the Senate in considering this report to sympathetically understand the problems of rural communities like Mareeba, and Mareeba in particular, and do what it can to assist that community adjust.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We can see the rural industries that this Labor government has destroyed. It just about single-handedly destroyed the wool industry and, through its penny-pinching attitude, it is about to destroy the beef industry in this country because it will not provide adequate drought relief.

Certain advantages were given to industries in Australia: the dairy industry, the orange industry and the tobacco industry. The former two industries received disadvantages when the government agreed to sign the GATT.

The dairy and orange industries are two; and the tobacco industry is another. </PARA>

It has made an agreement with the dairy industry that it will find some mechanism that is GATT legal that will offset the disadvantages to the dairy industry. It has also told the orange industry that it will be assisted if it can come up with a revenue neutral plan. That is to be welcomed and I praise the government for doing it; but there is a certain inconsistency with the tobacco industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But wait, one might say, do we not have a program for natural disasters&mdash;a natural disaster relief policy? Will the government not cover this? Sadly, of course, the answer is no. Why? It so happens that on 1 July 1989 the Labor government decided that droughts were not natural disasters. It is unbelievable but true. What are they? Are they unnatural disasters or are they not disasters? Surely nobody can claim that this is not a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is crazy. The impact of this is that the natural disaster base money fund around Australia, some $200 million in round figures that could be lent to struggling farmers and small businesses at 2.75 per cent interest, is not available. It is available if there is a fire, a flood, a cyclone, an earthquake or even a storm but it is not available as a result of this government's deliberate policy decision. It is not available for what is one of the most serious disasters to affect this country&mdash;drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government done? So far it has done almost nothing about the drought. It essentially insulted farmers by offering $2 million, and then subsequently raising it to $14 million. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has this week been dragged screaming into the rural areas to see the magnitude of the disaster. Hopefully he has now realised that something concrete not only needs to be done but also has to be done to save the backbone of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His ministers do not seem to agree. As recently as 1 September, the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, was saying that the most important thing to do was to let the farmers know what was available under social security benefits, that a publicity campaign would be launched and that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, would address this in November. This was at the beginning of September. Fortunately, it seems that Senator Collins is a little more aware than Mr Baldwin. Apparently he will take some measures to cabinet to resolve some of these issues. But the mere fact that only two or three weeks ago the main aims of the government were to put forward a publicity campaign and to see what things were like in November indicates its complete ignorance and lack of understanding of one of the great natural disasters we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some lessons to be learnt. In 1983 Peter Nixon, who was the primary industry minister under Fraser, announced spending of $356 million. Probably in today's money it is something like double that amount. Compare that with what has been offered by the government so far&mdash;$2 million and $14 million. It is insulting to think of those sorts of amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Peter Nixon wanted to do and in fact implemented was to pay 75 per cent of the transport costs of fodder, a supplement for water cartage costs, a subsidy to ensure that appropriate bores were drilled in various areas and carry-on loans capped at four per cent interest for small businesses as well as for farmers&mdash;the small businesses in the towns are just as badly affected in many areas as the farms which they supply&mdash;and it worked. It kept farmers on the land and, more importantly in many ways, it preserved the breeding herds. The government should clearly take a leaf out of the coalition book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A short time ago John Anderson, Deputy Leader of the National Party, released the new drought policy from the coalition. I have to say that I applaud it. Some of those elements from 1983 are included in it. The policy includes, for example, a fodder subsidy very similar to that introduced by Nixon in 1982-83. It includes support for a debt reconstruction for farmers. It includes a return of the drought condition to the natural disaster relief arrangements. How on earth that was ever taken out is beyond anybody with any nous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps importantly, one of the recommendations of the coalition policy is a suspension of the assets test for welfare payments such as jobsearch and family payments for those farmers who are suffering extreme financial hardship as a result of events, including in this case such a severe drought. The policy includes a provision of farm household support as family income support for a period of 12 months for eligible farmers. It includes lifting the present 12-month limit on assistance under the RAS drought exceptional circumstances provisions, making it available for up to a year after a drought declaration has been revoked. It lifts the restriction of one re-establishment grant per farming enterprise to allow full grants to be paid to two or more eligible families who are currently dependent upon an enterprise. The coalition has promised to improve the income equalisation deposit scheme to encourage farmers to set aside income in good years to be used during the bad years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are real changes. These are changes which will be effective and which will help farmers to get through these terrible years. It is not just the farmers; it is the small businesses and people living in rural areas. But of course we have to look also to the longer term. The government has been dragged screaming already and will eventually have to make an announcement. We all pray that, when it does, it will be a worthwhile one and so we urge the government to consider drought minimisation schemes. They were there ready to go under the Fraser government. They were scrapped by the Labor government, by Prime Minister Hawke, because basically there are no votes in such long-term schemes. This government always looks to the short term and to the reward of the votes of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just thank goodness that in New South Wales John Fahey has had the good commonsense to turn down the $150 million bribe to improve the Prime Minister's view by getting rid of the Cahill Expressway and to focus on the real problems facing New South Wales, as he has done so excellently over the last two or three years. John Fahey has down-to-earth commonsense rather than Paul Keating's grandiose so-called vision, which is essentially irrelevant to day-to-day living in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers are the backbone of Australia. They have a human problem and they have an economic problem. For both of these reasons we need action, we need action now, we need sensible action and we need to focus on this problem, not on the aesthetics from the Prime Minister's front window. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about the second annual women of the land gathering held at Gunnedah last weekend. I was so impressed with the attitude and enthusiasm of whose who attended that I thought it deserved the attention of the Senate. The aim of the gathering is for rural women to work together towards friendship, learning and caring for their future growth. This sums up the women of the land movement. It is about looking after each other through communication and sharing experience. It is about learning and teaching from each other's experiences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told by my wife, who attended this women of the land gathering, that the evident enthusiasm of all the women there was quite magnificent. There were people there such as Mrs Audrey Hardman, who was the ex-CWA chairman in New South Wales and whom you, Madam Acting Deputy President West, would well know. The town hall was filled to capacity. I think there were nearly 400 people at that gathering, which says a lot for what the women were trying to do: to learn from each other and to learn how to cope with such things as the present drought. The keynote speaker was Marie Mahood, who comes from central Queensland. She talked about the privations that country women face in different areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These women talked about a wide range of issues. They talked about women's health, farm safety, computers, coping alone, risk management, relaxation, landcare, starting a new business and self-assertiveness. From the women I met at the gathering, I can assure the Senate that there is definitely a great deal of assertiveness amongst country women, and I take my hat off to them. They talked about superannuation, self-defence and suicide awareness. They had a variety of workshops which all gave an indication of the issues about rural women and the things that they are concerned about. It showed a hunger for the means by which women can improve their contribution to themselves, to their farms and to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Friday night, four women gave their views on their experiences in life. They covered issues such as whether they had to deliver people's children in the communities; whether they had to walk across flooded creeks and give birth to their own babies because they lived in isolated areas; and whether they had the problem of having no telephones, which in the past a lot of people faced in the really outback parts, the lack of electricity and those sorts of things. On top of all this, these women who went through these privations and looked after and helped their husbands also had to raise the kids, prepare the meals and keep the house. They really helped their husbands and their spouses in making a go of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Friday night, Gwen Griffith put forward three very important points in her short talk. She said, `Life is what you make it; the world owes you nothing; and the importance of education cannot be understated.' These three points demonstrate a fantastic attitude which is prevalent throughout rural Australia. I would like to think that more people in Australia could take on board such a selfless attitude. </PARA>

I would like to give special congratulations to Janet Redden, who was the convener of the women of the land gathering.

I also congratulate Sister Gabrielle Foley, Diane Bently, Councillor Gaye Swain and Min Slack-Smith. They all did a fantastic job in organising the gathering.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that a very important international issue has arisen that involves Australia, and I refer to the peace process that is in train on Bougainville between the Bougainville interim government, Sam Kaouna who is the leader of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Papua New Guinea government led by Sir Julius Chan. The cease-fire agreement occurred in Honiara on 9 September&mdash;only a couple of weeks ago&mdash;between those parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement occurred on neutral territory on the Solomon Islands. Neutrality was the major theme of the talks and it was hoped that it would help lower the guard of people who had been at war for over six years, and would also tame their suspicions. This approach worked well and people on both sides began to talk to each other again after an age. They found that they were talking the same language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cease-fire agreement was signed in Honiara and the Bougainvillean and Papua New Guinea representatives agreed to the following points: firstly, they agreed to a cease-fire; secondly, they agreed to lift the blockade on 10 October, the same day that the peace talks would begin in Arawa; thirdly, they agreed to hold a pan-Bougainville conference; and, fourthly, they agreed to have a South Pacific peacekeeping force on Bougainville that would be neutral and would have a United Nations mandate, and all parties would be consulted on the decision. The peacekeepers were to be made up of troops from Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, very quickly after the Honiara meeting ended, Australia pushed ahead with its own plans for peacekeeping which by-passed the Bougainvillean negotiators. With utmost efficiency, Australia broke two parts of the cease-fire agreement. We found out that they had been reinforcing the blockade by sending in the Royal Australian Navy on a ship patrolling the border between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cast our minds back to the June report of the Australian delegation to Bougainville led by Senator Loosley, we see that the Australian position then and now was that the blockade needed to be enforced to force the BRA to a negotiating position. A blockade would not only stop arms, but it would have serious humanitarian ramifications. Yet the delegation insisted that the blockade be further tightened, knowing that no medicine, food, clothing et cetera would be able to get through to help innocent civilians. So the Australian government is again reiterating this recurring theme of the blockade and is sending in the Royal Australian Navy, which was never a part of the cease-fire agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also appointed command of the entire peacekeeping force, although the members of the force are from the South Pacific nations. This command will take the form of Australian force commander Brigadier Peter Abigail, who will work closely with deputy force commander Setu Tupou from Tonga and Savenaca Draunidalo, head of operations of the Fiji military forces. Australia will also provide the ships, helicopters and logistical and financial support for the peacekeeping force. Australia basically told the little countries of Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu what was happening with the peacekeeping force. As reported in AAP, `Australia put its view and stuck to it', and the little countries had to agree if our government maintained that they could not provide all the equipment without Australia being in charge of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major question here is why Australia is taking these specific actions in regard to the Bougainville peace process when any party's help in bringing the warring parties together must be neutral. Australia could claim that it believes it had nothing to do with the civil war in Bougainville, although CRA has a lot to answer for in its management of the workers and the social and environmental implications of the Panguna copper mine which the local people opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it really does not matter whether Australia believes it is at fault. If there is a perception among the parties involved that Australia is part of the problem, our very presence will jeopardise the peace process. This is what has happened as a consequence of Australia trying to muscle in and play the heavy regional power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote Sam Kaona, leader of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army with his views of Australia's part in all this. He believes that the BRA has been completely left out of the negotiations over the peacekeeping force and is angry about Australian interference and our growing involvement in the Bougainville peace process, especially on the issue of patrolling the border. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The border is to be monitored by a third party. We do not consider Australia as a third party in this dispute, they are primary.</PARA>
<PARA>It is evident that Australia is interfering in and threatening a very fragile peace process. The government needs to start respecting the sovereignty of nations in sorting out their own problems and only offer assistance without bully-boy tactics and without trying to get a hand in in the resolution of the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We respect the sovereignty of nations like Indonesia and refuse to criticise, let alone interfere with, their affairs in case it damages our trade and defence relationship. But we have a different rule of thumb for Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. The Australian government should carefully consider its position because if peace talks break down now it will have a lot to answer for and blame will come its way from the Bougainvilleans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not have a clean record on Papua New Guinea. We give them military aid and training, equipment, helicopters and munitions to use against the Bougainvilleans. We have been the major figure in the arming and training of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, with over half of the force trained by Australians since the conflict began in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to urgently consider its role in the Bougainville peace process before it does real damage. The peace talks have not yet moved to tackle the hard issues such as a negotiated level of independence or autonomy for Bougainvilleans. As the peace talks get tougher it will not take much for Australia or anyone else to derail the talks. If the process meets obstacles and goes back to square one it will be even harder next time to get both sides back to the negotiating table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, today at question time Senator Gareth Evans made a very dismissive response to a question from Senator Kemp about the Australiana Fund. That is the fund that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his arrogance has decided is no longer needed despite the fact that there are many projects planned for the official establishments&mdash;Government House, Kirribilli House, Admiralty House and the Lodge&mdash;which will require the sort of support that the Australiana Fund has given in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, this Prime Minister has decided that because the Australiana Fund had the hide to stand up to him to prevent him getting his own way with the Thai teak table&mdash;because of the fund's independence and its standing up for principle&mdash;in his usual petty and arrogant way the Prime Minister has removed from that fund its capacity to hold open days at the official establishments in order to raise money to proceed with its activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coincidentally, the annual report of the Official Establishments Trust released this afternoon reveals that there is a whole range of new projects to get under way at the official establishments. Yet the justification that the Prime Minister gave for getting rid of the Australiana Fund by removing its capacity to raise money is that there was no further need for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This kind of pettiness is absurd and is in fascinating contrast with what the Official Establishments Trust tells us in its latest report about the Australiana Fund. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trust maintained through 1993-94 its close relationship with the Australiana Fund, which was established to encourage direct public participation in the acquisition of works of Australian art, furnishings and history for the Official Residences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fund membership includes representatives from throughout Australia. The Chairman and one other member (Mrs Penelope Seidler) of the Trust are ex-officio Deputy Presidents of the Fund. Fund income is derived by way of donations of cash and items of interest from the private and corporate sectors. In addition, Open Days at the official residences have augmented the Fund's income considerably: the Open Days in October 1993 contributed a net $25,652 and the Trust's work in preserving and presenting the houses was appreciated by approximately 15,000 members of the public who visited the official establishments on the Open Days.</PARA>
<PARA>They certainly will not be visiting them any more; the Prime Minister will not let them because the Australiana Fund has had the hide to stand in the way of his whims. In fact, last year the Australiana Fund added a number of important items to its collection, including&mdash;and I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a bronze sculpture by Sir Bertram Mackennal entitled "Truth";</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a cedar work table (circa 1825), formerly the property of Professor Leslie Wilkinson;</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt the Prime Minister would not like something genuine like that in any official establishment when, with a little more expense, he can have a Thai teak table&mdash;a genuine reproduction one. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a Sunderland lustre jug featuring an illustration of the emigrant ship "The Great Australia"; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">four sterling silver salts (1800) by John Edwards featuring the coat of arms of Thomas Townsend, first Viscount Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>Those sorts of arrangements are no longer to be made. No doubt Senator Kemp will deal with the clear need for the trust in the future, based on the enormous amount of work to be done. There are even suggestions of replacing The Lodge. Obviously, there is enormous scope for the Australiana Fund in that sort of situation which is still under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that Mrs Margaret Betteridge was the woman who effectively stood up to the Prime Minister and told him that it was inappropriate to have his Thai teak table. Let us recognise that the Official Establishments Trust had taken the strong view that the historical theme adopted for The Lodge was a 1920s style redecoration. I do not know whether the Thai teak table fits into that. It certainly did not fit into the criteria that Mrs Betteridge as fine arts adviser had recommended. The thing is she was effectively forced to resign. It is interesting to note that the Official Establishments Trust makes special mention of her and commends her in its annual report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trust members also wish to express their appreciation of the professional and devoted service provided to them by three former members of the Official Establishments Secretariat staff&mdash;Mr Peter Luck and Mrs Margaret Betteridge (both of whom left the Trust Secretariat in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in October 1993 after many years in the Official Establishments Section, Mrs Betteridge as Fine Arts Adviser and Mr Luck providing Secretariat services to the Trust) and Mr Bryan Hoffmann, who was Comptroller of The Lodge and Kirribilli House for eight years.</PARA>
<PARA>So on the one hand the Official Establishments Trust expressed its appreciation of the professional and devoted service provided by Mrs Betteridge. On the other hand, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has made certain that she was obliged basically to resign because she stood up to him and would not let him have his way, which was inappropriate and wrong. I must say I am overjoyed to see that the Official Establishments Trust is prepared to stand up to the Prime Minister also to say how much it commends Mrs Betteridge for her service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity we do not have more Mrs Betteridges around the place to stand up to this arrogant Prime Minister. Maybe, of course, he would run out of people to sack or to force into resigning from the Public Service. No doubt there is a clear need for people not to be stood over by this man. I am glad to say that the Official Establishments Trust has refused to be stood over in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add briefly to the remarks that my colleague Senator Michael Baume made. We have learned that the Thai teak table has claimed another series of victims. As my colleague Senator Baume pointed out, the first victim was Mrs Betteridge, who was the arts adviser in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Apparently, she did not agree with Mr Keating's desire to purchase a Thai teak table and, as a result of this, a newspaper report notes that her work in the department dried up&mdash;no work to do&mdash;and she resigned to seek some fresh fields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the members of the Australiana Fund are the second victim. It has been clearly indicated to the Australiana Fund by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that its great, historic services are no longer required for the four main official establishments. We are seeing a mean and spiteful action by a mean and spiteful Prime Minister. I would say to the members of the Australiana Fund, `The fund will be there a long time after Mr Keating has gone. Your work is appreciated by this parliament. Your services to the nation are recognised. I urge you to continue your</PARA>
<PARA>good works as best you can without any help from Mr Keating.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Michael Baume referred to the open days last year when some 15,000 Australians took the opportunity to go through the four official establishments to see how the grounds and those houses are kept and the way they are set out. Those who went there reported that the open days were received with great enthusiasm. Australians are entitled to see how their establishments, not Mr Keating's establishments, Australia's establishments, are run and to have a chance to admire their art work and design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this sorry saga has now claimed another series of victims. The Prime Minister is charged with running this country with all the problems that Australia has at the moment: massive long-term unemployment; a huge drought; massive foreign debt; a balance of payments crisis; and the development of an underclass in this country. It is beyond belief why a prime minister of this country would indulge in such a mean and spiteful act. It is about time Mr Keating concentrated on his main game and encouraged people in groups like the Australiana Fund to make the contribution which they are able to make. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) I am aware of the role of Nuexco in the nuclear fuels market which is not just as a uranium broker. The company also trades significant volumes of uranium and its owner, Concord Resources, also has interests in some United States mines which are currently non-operational. Nuexco is thus a market participant and its analysis of market trends ought to be treated with the same degree of caution as that of any other market participant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (b) I am aware of the paper by Mr George White Jr, Senior Vice President of Nuexco, entitled The Future for Nuclear Power and the Uranium Market, including figure 6 that compares world natural uranium requirements with inventories. In this paper White stated that world uranium inventories, including military highly enriched uranium, provided enough material to fuel world requirements to beyond the year 2005. I also note, however, that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) a substantial portion of the Nuexco figure for civilian inventories comprises Russian stocks, the size of which has been subject to considerable conjecture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Russia has indicated a preference to keep its civilian uranium stockpile for domestic use and for exports to the West to be based on natural uranium production and provision of enrichment services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) the only firm proposal for diverting military highly enriched uranium to the civil market is under the US-Russia agreement finalised last January. The 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium under this agreement will be gradually absorbed into the civil market at the rate of 10 tonnes a year for the first 5 years and 30 tonnes a year during the remaining 15 years of the agreement. The agreement is also understood to stipulate that the material will be marketed in a manner that minimises any market disruptions;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) White also postulated in his paper that it was possible that politics will keep any additional military stocks from entering the civil market, in which case Nuexco expected civilian inventories to reduce to minimum levels in less than 5 years. The investment by Concord, Nuexco's owner, in standby uranium production capacity in the US suggests that it expects this to be the more likely scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (c) The statement in White's paper that the current rate of inventory drawdown could proceed for 30 to 40 years before production needs to be expanded is based on the unlikely assumption that stocks of all military highly enriched uranium will be made available to the civil market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Current spot uranium prices are below production costs of virtually all uranium mines and would generally need to firm to induce any new production. However, even in today's depressed market there are still some utility buyers willing to pay a premium to assure long-term security of</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">uranium supplies, so current spot prices should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of prices available under long term contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Details of production costs are commercial in confidence.</PARA>
