<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to take much time&mdash;obviously, I have not been given much time on such an important issue. The motion references recent comments by both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) regarding support in Thailand for the Khmer Rouge. I am aware that there are some in the government who feel that these comments are not in conflict with any proposal to export small arms to Thailand, but I am afraid that I will need to be convinced of that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 6 November 1994, Senator Evans, while clearly stating that he did not believe that senior levels of the Thai government were involved directly in supporting the Khmer Rouge, did make reference to the failure of the Thai government to prevent `freelance military personnel and business spivs' from doing so. This sentiment is consistent with comments made in May this year by Mr Morton Abramowitz, a former US ambassador to Thailand, who stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some Thais want to keep a hand in Cambodian affairs and create a sort of permanent buffer zone against a renascent Vietnam. A senior Thai official told me in 1992 that protecting the Khmer Rouge was an important element of Thai security. The Thai publicly proclaim the opposite and provide economic assistance to the Phnom Penh government, but even if it doesn't condone the military's complicity with the Khmer Rouge in violation of Cambodia's sovereignty, it has not controlled the practice. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of these admissions about the problems faced by the Thai government in controlling forces in Thailand which are committed to assisting the Khmer Rouge, I cannot see any sense in sending any small arms to that nation because of the potential for those arms to find their way into the hands of the Khmer Rouge forces. Personally, I could not live with myself if it was discovered that Australian weapons were used in the sort of genocide that took place under the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that I feel it important to place on the record my concerns about the potential sale of Australian arms to Thailand and to highlight some concerns raised by me and five other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, including Senator Bourne, in an additional report that was incorporated in a recently released report on the implications of Australian defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report, the six committee members highlighted some shortcomings in the approval processes for Australian defence exports, particularly in relation to the dominant role of the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Steyr rifle sale is a case in point: here we have a proposal for a major sale of weapons to a country where serious questions have been raised both internationally and by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in this country. These are questions of the implication of the sale to a nation in which at least some elements of the military have been implicated in transfers to an insurgent force of extreme brutality. There are implications that this may be a deliberate strategy of destabilisation of a neighbouring country by elements of the Thai military. The arms proposed for sale are small arms, the sort that the Khmer Rouge would use. Even should those arms not be directly on-sold to the Khmer Rouge, we admit it is likely that the arms they replace may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current guidelines the criteria include consistency with Australia's broad national interests. They include implications for Australia's international obligations to our friends and allies and to the United Nations, including arms control and human rights considerations. They also include implications for regional stability, and whether the proposed export is likely to be used in conflict, either internal or external, or could further militarise such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to question what in this motion is so terrible to the government, because there are only a couple of things that we have asked. Firstly, we have asked that the proposal be referred to the standing interdepartmental committee for defence exports. The problem with the current system is that it is left to the Department of Defence, and it is left too late; and that was pointed out by the inquiry. Secondly, we have asked that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade do an inquiry into the potential for anything to go wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I wonder why the heck we have a committee available to look at potential problems with defence exports if this kind of situation is not considered sensitive enough to refer to the committee at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opposing this motion I will explain why we will not extend time. Urgency, not substance, is the key factor in calling for suspension of standing orders. Senator Margetts has spent five minutes on the substance, so I guess I will have to do the same, even if it is infringing the standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very poorly framed motion in the way it has been designed. It is poorly framed because it calls on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do things which are, in fact, the responsibility of the Department of Defence. It also tends to send the major request to the wrong committee. In any event, it would not matter what the issues were in current debate, Senator Margetts would not support the export of Steyr rifles to any country around the globe because, fundamentally, she does not support any defence exports. So she takes this current issue and dresses it up to disguise her fundamental opposition, which I respect but do not endorse, to the export of arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just put a few facts on the record. Firstly, there is no application from ADI or any other Australian company to export rifles to Thailand. The Thai government has not made a decision as to which country or even which type of rifle it will source and it will probably not make such a decision for another 12 months. We have in place procedures and guidelines that will adequately cover all Senator Margetts's concerns; that is, guidelines that are constantly revised&mdash;the last revision was in March 1994&mdash;in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney-General's and all these other departments have a say on the committee and an equal vote with Defence as to whether export approval will be given. A whole range of activities are taken into account in any decision made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have absolute confidence that if an Australian firm were to win an export order none of those arms would be on-sold to the Khmer Rouge because the Thai government is putting in place procedures where that cannot occur. The allegation has been extended from Senator Margetts as to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and by implication the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said about Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge. There has been no allegation from this government that the Thai government has given any material assistance to the Khmer Rouge. There has also been an acknowledgment by this government that the Thai government has tried to cut off any Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fundamental point is that we would like the Thai government to redouble its efforts to prevent any individuals in Thailand giving aid to the Khmer Rouge. We recognise that, because the Thai-Cambodian border is as rugged as it is and also because there are traditional trading routes across it, this is a fundamentally difficult task. There is a sensitivity from Australia's point of view. I think the horror that all Australians would feel if that general who was responsible for the brutal execution of an Australian citizen were able to find refuge across the border from pursuit by the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces would be something we could not live with. I want to make it very explicit where we stand on this particular issue. We are not in any way accusing the Thai government of giving aid and succour to the Khmer Rouge. We are asking it, wherever it can, to redouble its efforts to prevent any individuals getting any particular assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have multiple reasons for not supporting the suspension of standing orders. We have available time in general business to discuss these matters. I am not going to run the argument that we are busy doing other things because we can always fit things in. But this is an appallingly drafted motion. It is one that is, in fact, a little duplicitous on the part of Senator Margetts because the implication is that if we fixed everything else up and these other problems did not exist she would support the export of Steyr rifles. We all know that Senator Margetts will not support defence exports to any area whatsoever. So I think at this stage this matter will have to take its chances with all the other competing priorities in general business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the question of the suspension of standing orders, I do not think that a case for urgency has been made out in the circumstances of what seems to be a relatively preliminary stage of development of the possible sale of rifles from Australia to Thailand, and also the fact that procedures are in place that would require assessment of and a contribution to the process by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is what Senator Margetts is seeking in any event. But the debate has ranged a little more widely than that, if I am correctly assessing the matter. I will make a few general comments as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very worrying situation occurring in Cambodia and it is ongoing. We were told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that he was confident that, after the change of policy by the Chinese government, the sources of supply and maintenance of the Khmer Rouge would quickly dry up and their capacity to wage an ongoing civil war would be severely impeded. In effect, he was arguing that after the elections in Cambodia the Khmer Rouge could be no more than a nuisance factor and within a relatively short period their cause would be lost and the future for Cambodia would be much brighter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always believed his assessment of the Khmer Rouge was naive. We believed he was naive when he embraced the Khmer Rouge within the peace process. Looking at the history and record of the KR, we could not understand how he ever believed that they would genuinely participate in a democratic process or how they might ever genuinely participate in a democratic government. We thought he was naive in his assessment that they would not continue their armed conflict after that election process. Their whole approach to politics in Cambodia has been to take power and influence through the barrel of a gun. There had been no indication upon which he could have reasonably relied that should have led him to the view that they had fundamentally changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that what we have is a Cambodian government that is in a shocking state of repair. The assessment of the previous Australian Ambassador to Cambodia is that of a government that would appear to be severely corrupt, a military that seems to be largely out of control&mdash;some would also say corrupt&mdash;and a civil war that is continuing. All the signs are that the Khmer Rouge is as dangerous and as influential as it was before that process. They are being sustained and armed by someone. We thought we might get a hint yesterday because apparently the Minister for Foreign Affairs had a document prepared by his department which was going to give the parliament an up-to-date assessment of the strength and capacity of the Khmer Rouge, the government's view as to their ongoing war-waging potential and the government's current assessment of safety issues regarding Australians in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister for Foreign Affairs pulled that yesterday. You would have heard, Madam Acting Deputy President, that he decided not to put down that statement on the basis that it did not introduce sufficient new matters. We can only be gravely concerned about that. We are puzzled as to whether the Australian government is confused as to what is going on in Cambodia, whether it is giving sound and adequate advice to Australian citizens in Cambodia, many of whom are doing very worthwhile work in aid projects, apart from those who may be visiting as tourists or for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are deeply disturbed that that assessment by the department was not put on the record yesterday so that Australians would be better informed. There is no doubt that the Khmer Rouge are continuing their conflict. They are as ruthless and shocking as ever. It has perhaps become more apparent to Australians because of the sad death of an Australian recently at their hands, but that does not change the fundamental issues. There are a lot of important issues relating to this matter that ought to be debated at an appropriate time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats believe this is an urgent motion. Things have changed. I did not notice Senator Margetts saying that anybody believed that the Thai government was selling Steyr rifles to the Khmer Rouge, the SLORC or anybody else, and certainly we do not believe that. I do not think anybody believes that. I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, is exactly right when he says there is a real problem with some of the Thai military&mdash;not all of them&mdash;particularly the ones on the border with Cambodia and on the border with Burma. Senator Evans called them business spivs, and I would have to agree with that as well. There are some people who are totally out of control in Thailand, and those people can get a hold of Steyr rifles from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they are out of control they are likely, in my view and in the view of many people&mdash;including those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, I would imagine, Senator Margetts&mdash;to sell those Steyr rifles where they can get the most money. And they are likely to get the most money&mdash;or gemstones, or timber or anything that they can then sell to make money for themselves&mdash;from the Khmer Rouge and the SLORC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an urgent motion. The reason it has been put up, I believe, and I agree with it, is the recent inquiry into the defence export guidelines. We found that the guidelines were a lot better than they had been, but there were bits around the edges which could be significantly improved. One of those bits around the edges was that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ought to have a far more significant input into where our defence exports go and why they go there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the most significant input by far is with the Department of Defence. The Department of Defence does not necessarily look at Australia's strategic interests around the world and particularly in this region when it decides what it will recommend and what it will do in the end on defence exports. Senator Margetts and I, and the others who signed the additional report into this, believe the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should have a far more significant role in this whole area of defence exports. This is one of the parts of Senator Margetts's motion and I absolutely agree with it. They should have a far more significant role. They should be the ones looking at the strategic interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that process is looking at whether it is in our best interests that our Australian Steyr rifles end up in the hands of the Khmer Rouge. As the foreign minister has said, the Khmer Rouge are getting aid and ammunition and goodness knows what from certain people in Thailand who are not necessarily&mdash;in fact, they are probably not&mdash;under the control of the Thai government, and that is the problem. That is why the department of foreign affairs ought to be looking at this, that is why the standing interdepartmental committee ought to be looking at this and that is why we ought to be looking at this. That is why we ought to be supporting this motion right now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it perfectly clear that in respect of the sale of arms to foreign countries for their legitimate defence purposes it would be better for that sale to be made by a country like Australia which has far more stringent guidelines than a number of other countries that I could think of. That having been said, however, this is an issue which concerns all of us here and I do not think anyone in the chamber would be other than appalled at the prospect of Australian arms being channelled through certain sources in Thailand to the Khmer Rouge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then arises of the appropriateness, or at least the urgency, of Senator Margetts's motion. It has been suggested that the matter is not all that urgent because these matters are in their formative stages, the questions are being considered and presumably the options are being offered to the Thai authorities. I would have thought that that means it is rather urgent that the issue be settled prior to the matter proceeding too far along the road. Under those circumstances, I would have thought that it would be desirable to at least debate the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether the Senate ultimately adopts the motion in the terms in which it is presented is another question. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has suggested that the committee mentioned in the motion is not the appropriate committee to which to refer this matter. Let him tell us which is the appropriate committee. During the debate, let him put forward an amendment. What is wrong with the examination that is being sought in this motion? I would have thought it is pretty non-controversial even for those people, including myself, who believe that there is a role for Australia to play in the supply of defence material for legitimate defence purposes for specific governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chamarette moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence to a motion to postpone consideration of certain legislation introduced in the current sittings till the first day of sitting in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved to suspend the standing orders in order to request the Senate to give due consideration to the fact that on 18 August 1993 Senator Gareth Evans announced to the Senate a practice that, thereafter, the government would introduce legislation on an `introduce one session, debate the next' basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a motion that I moved in the Senate on Thursday, 25 August, I suggested that the government needed to table detailed reasons why, if the bill was not unseen, steps were not taken quickly or effectively enough to maintain the practice and avoid a collapse into confusion and abandonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently we have more than 50 bills on the Senate program and we have approximately 12 sitting days left. We have also to take the most optimistic view of our efficient rate of debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of those 50 bills have been introduced into the Senate in this session. The bills mentioned in my motion are the bills listed for today, two of which are listed for the lunch time non-controversial period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is urgent that the Senate gives consideration to the way in which the government has abandoned the agreed practice. The motion should be debated to see what the government intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the Senate agrees that there is good reason for each of these bills being on the program for the remaining 12 sitting days, they should be adjourned to the first day of the next sitting. This is obviously an urgent matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek the support of fellow senators to do this commonsense thing which will aid the government in dealing with its program. The Senate will have consensus on the bills that are considered to be worthy of inclusion for the remaining days of this session, despite the fact that they have only been introduced this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will then be able to address the difficult task of preparing for the large number of bills that remain before the Senate even if every newly introduced bill is adjourned to the first day of the next sitting. This is a very important motion that needs to be debated to allow every all sides of the chamber to express a view on the practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a very important matter, and I would like to have the time to explain why I think it is in the interests of democracy and community scrutiny that we adjourn any bill that has been introduced this session for debate and completion in the next session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that I have persuaded the chamber that it is urgent to debate this matter and to reorganise the program to suit the Senate, and not to suit the government at the expense of the Senate and the public of Australia. The community wants us to approach the legislation that we have before us in a reasoned way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is quite legitimate for priority to be set by the people who will be debating the bills; otherwise, we will revert to the unfortunate practice that we had over two years ago and in the last 12 days of the session we will have so many bills to consider that we will not be able to do our job properly and debate the bills properly. The reason for that is that the priority for debating those bills has not been determined by content, importance or urgency, but simply because of the order on the government program. I believe that this is a matter that all honourable senators need to consider and that is why we should give it urgent consideration this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, we discussed this matter in our party room this morning. Rather than seek to hijack the proceedings at this stage, I cannot see why we do not revert to the usual cooperative practice where the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the leaders and whips of each party&mdash;including the Greens&mdash;sit down together and say, `This is what we need to get through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what we are designating as important for the end of this session.' We have not tried to do that yet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose we do that and not vote in favour of this motion at the moment. We wait for the government to give us some indication that it is prepared to pursue the practice of the past and leave it at that for the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the chamber do have concerns about the way in which government business has been managed this year and in previous years. It is an almost inevitable fact of political life at the moment that, every time we get to November, there is a huge number of bills introduced into the parliament which the government wants dealt with before the end of the year. Many of them, as far as primary industry is concerned, are introduced very late into this session. That places enormous pressure on honourable senators who wish to speak on primary industry bills to pull off the bills so that the legislation can get through. That causes enormous concern and angst on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the late introduction of bills is done to make it difficult to scrutinise the bills, to make it difficult to understand the consequences of the legislation and to make it difficult for the public and the media to comment on the legislation that the government is introducing. There are also a few unforeseen consequences of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only have to go to the last sitting day we had before the last federal election. We were here at 2.30 in the morning debating a bill to set AQIS inspection charges for the export of primary produce. Former senator Archer quite rightly pointed out that the per tonne inspection charge for onions was 40 times the per tonne inspection charge for potatoes. It was quite obviously a typographical error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very nasty debate in the chamber&mdash;I remember it distinctly&mdash;in which the government said it was not going to amend the legislation and was not going to enter into any discussion with the opposition because it was 2.30 in the morning. Eventually the Democrats relented and voted with the government. What happened? One of the first bills we had when we came back after the federal election was a bill to amend the amendment act that we had put through on the last day of sitting, altering the per tonne inspection charge for onions because, yes, there had been a typographical error. When that sort of thing happens, we have to have some concern about the quality of the management being exercised in relation to government business and the way legislation is brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, we need to have a close look at the motion and understand the consequences of it. Those of us on this side of the chamber do not want to be contributing to a situation where legislation which ought to go through is needlessly put off. I understand that Senator Chamarette has said that the motion can in some way be amended. We are not quite sure exactly how. </PARA>

So it makes it a little difficult for us to make these decisions on the run. We do not want to needlessly interrupt the legislative program but we want to ensure proper scrutiny and proper debate of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next couple of minutes we will have to look at the motion which is before the chamber very carefully and get a thorough understanding of what the suggestion is and what the implications are. I note that some of the legislation which has been identified to me may be legislation which would require passage before the end of the calender year. If that is the case, obviously it will have to be amended. But we will give it decent consideration. We think the matter is certainly worthy of attention and that is the basis on which the opposition will be dealing with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather difficult to debate a motion that we have not seen. Yet the complaint from the Greens, in particular, is that they do not want to debate legislation they have not been given enough notice of. So there is an irony there first of all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the real question in this part of the debate is whether it is necessary to deal with this at this moment, for indeed we had an opportunity 24 hours ago for Senator Chamarette to give a notice of motion so that today this matter could be either declared formal or, by using a contingent notice of motion, be discussed. I am debating today a motion I have not seen; and that is difficult. Where is the written version of this? Why the ambush right now? Why the ambush at 25 minutes to 11 on this Thursday?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this Senate were to follow any decent and proper procedures, it would defeat this motion, and Senator Chamarette would give notice of motion of it today and seek to have it debated, through a similar means, on Monday. It would also be more appropriate, of course, for the motion to be debated when the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner) is here and not away on government business&mdash;he will not return till midday. I would oppose Senator Chamarette's motion at this stage on this basis: I have not read it; I do not know what discussions have taken place; and the Manager of Government Business is not here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been ample opportunity to put a notice of motion down, even this morning, to have it debated on Monday. If we have to get into the substance of the debate, I would argue that many of those bills are urgent&mdash;some are budget related and some are necessary to go through. I would also adduce arguments that this government has not had ample opportunity to debate legislation in the spring session and that the Senate has gone off on many romps, as it often does, on disallowance motions and many other things. The percentage of time so far devoted to the legislative program as compared with the totality of Senate time spent is quite low&mdash;but normal; I stress, it is normal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. We have had legislation ready every day. This is the normal process. I am not alleging filibustering or anything else. I am saying that this is the normal process in the Senate as weeks go by and more time is spent on legislation, rather than less, as we get further into the session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the central point: it is rather hard to debate a motion I have not got in front of me and of which I do not know the conditions. It was absolutely unnecessary to do it this way, unless the Greens were looking for a thrill kill. Was that the reason? Do they want the excitement of moving their contingent notice of motion by way of ambush? They can have their thrill; they have had their thrill. But that is not really a position they can argue in a principled way, having had ample opportunity yesterday and today to give a notice of motion so it could be considered at whips' meetings and knocked around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe they will get support, I do not know; I am not involved in that process, and I have not been involved in that process. Maybe they will; but they have not sought to go down that particular path, which is the normal path. They have sought, by way of ambush, to have a motion we do not have in front of us debated now, on Thursday morning. What is urgent? Why do we not move on to the legislative program today? The Greens can then give a notice of motion if this motion gets defeated and then they might have an opportunity to debate it on Monday. I really think this is an unwarranted ambush. It is a very difficult motion to debate in principle or anything else when it is not before us in a written form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not support the suspension because the principal motion is not before us. I think it is in the terms that all bills that were not introduced in the last session of parliament cannot be dealt with in this session. An undertaking was given by the government that under normal circumstances that was how it intended to do business in this session, and it has not done that. It is not as if it is simply matters of urgency which the government has sought to bring on without their having been introduced in the previous session. It is simply a matter of convenience for the government to basically deal with the program as it has evolved according to its timetable&mdash;with a total disregard of the undertakings that were previously given to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I can understand the sentiment and the annoyance of the Greens that has led them to move this suspension, but that does not mean that this is the right way to deal with the matter. However, on a matter of principle, we will agree to deal in this session with bills which were not introduced in the last only if the government can make out a real and genuine case of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of circumstances we are talking about may relate to grants for the needy or whatever and the government's attempt to deal with the mass unemployment in this country. Obviously, if there are bills coming out in the government's program to address such matters, we will look sympathetically at a request to deal with them in this session. But where the government is just continuing in total disregard of the undertakings that were formerly given, we will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition suggests that the parties sit down on Monday morning and look at the program. If agreement cannot be reached as to which bills will be and which bills will not be dealt with in this session, then we can debate this in a sensible way on Monday and we will see where the numbers lie in relation to any particular bill. I told you, Mr Acting Deputy President, where the opposition stands in principle on the substantive issue. That is the way we would approach discussions on Monday or in the debate that would subsequently ensue in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to repeat what I said yesterday. The program in this session is a shambles. The government did not have its legislation ready, despite all the promises to the contrary. During the first half of the session the opposition was being requested to raise matters to fill in the day for the government. Now those opposite come here and say that they have insufficient time. The minority parties have been joining with the government to allow extensions of this sitting to enable the government's incompetent planning to, in effect, be implemented, which we say is a totally unsatisfactory way of doing business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will be interested to see on Monday morning how the minority parties approach these bills that the government is introducing or seeking to debate in breach of its earlier agreement. Obviously, the Greens have said on the record today that they are prepared to vote against the debate of those matters and hold the government to its agreement. If that is so, I commend them for that. We have never had such an undertaking from the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

The Democrats always jump to the government's request, and I have no doubt that it will happen again on Monday morning. We will see. The precedent is there. The Democrats agreed with the government to curtail the sittings of this session.

I quote what Senator Evans said on page 183 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 August:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That process will always have exceptions built into it.</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the processes. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, looking to the future and moving beyond this budget session, we are conscious of the need, if we possibly can, to do even better than this. We have decided in principle that in future we will introduce legislation&mdash;to the extent it proves possible; I have to add that qualification&mdash;on the basis of introduction in one sittings for debate in the next. I guess that that is the optimal position for everyone in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I repeat that that probably was not an undertaking; it was a desire. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will give everyone . . . the opportunity in the parliamentary break to fully consider their position and take such advice as they want, research it, produce sensible responses and deal with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process will always have some exceptions built into it.</PARA>
<PARA>He then states the exceptions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present budgetary process, obviously budget bills will always be an exception. However, that may not need to be the case under our proposed new system for dealing with budgets before the end of June. The precise implications of that for session times and sitting times have yet to be fully considered, so I cannot give any detailed description of what the process will be in that respect now. Obviously, it will make it potentially possible for that category of exceptions to be removed or modified.</PARA>
<PARA>Removed or modified&mdash;listen to that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, there will always have to be exceptions for urgent bills on unforeseen subjects.</PARA>
<PARA>So we are dealing with, as he says, what is potentially possible for the categories of exceptions to be removed or modified. We are dealing with a motion to suspend standing orders, but as I understand the substantive motion, it would be up to the government to bring us into its confidence as to which of those bills which have been introduced in this session, contrary to the optimal desire of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, fall into those categories of urgent bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear what the reasons are for the urgency of this motion. The reasons are very clear from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;seven new bills which were introduced in this session and not in the previous session. The reason for the urgency is that if we do not speak now, the roller-coaster goes along and we basically get bulldozed. To say that this can be done through the normal system obviously does not indicate any understanding of the way things work at a five-minute whips' meeting. If one is given a list of bills at a whips' meeting, the ability to argue in depth as to why a bill is urgent is not available. It is not an accountable method under which governments can operate or deal with the parliamentary and Senate process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this has not come out of the blue. The Greens have been expressing these concerns to the government for months. We were not given reasons for the bills being introduced. We asked for reasons and they were not given to us until we asked. Therefore, even the process which was foreshadowed, promised or mentioned by Senator Evans did not happen until it was forced. Therefore, without this kind of debate today, how could we have thought that there would be any action at all to deal with the real concerns about proper notice, proper consultation and proper consideration of important matters that get lumped into the process at this time of the year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the reasons were given, there was no effort by the government to then go to the various parties, let alone in the Senate chamber, to find out whether those reasons were acceptable reasons for the urgency. Senator Chamarette's motion mentions the seven new bills for today. Under this Senate process, if this motion were to go through, it would be perfectly possible for the government to bring its reasoned arguments to the Senate as to why any particular bill on that list should not be recommitted to this session. That gives the proper scrutiny process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a general method of operating that the urgency of that particular bill has to be proven and argued to the Senate, at least it is out in the open and at least all parties have the opportunity to participate. That is the urgency of it. The urgency is that in the morning or at the whips' meeting we get a list of bills and the ability to properly scrutinise the reasons for dealing with that at the time is not there, and that is not the correct way in which parliamentary scrutiny should be taking place, considering the undertakings that were given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). The decision to take some action in relation to this was perhaps brought on by the very fact that today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> has seven bills on it. </PARA>

I acknowledge that there may have been better ways to have raised this matter. Nevertheless, I regret that it is not being supported by the Senate because it will not give adequate time to debate the actual motion. But I do not believe that making arrangements on a party basis on a Monday morning and on a numbers basis, as Senator Hill said, is an adequate way to determine the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray asked why there was an ambush and not a notice of motion. I will tell him. He should ask himself what has happened to the program this morning. First of all, we were told we were to debate the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill. We have no objections to that bill being debated today. The next thing we were told is that we were doing the ATSIC land fund bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not have any objection to that; that was introduced last session. The other thing was that I did not know in what order these bills were planned to be debated. The only definite order I knew was that the lunchtime bills were all set in their order. That was fine, except that they included two bills that had been introduced in the last session. So I had a choice between entering the time that has been set aside for so-called non-controversial legislation and calling a division on whether that was an appropriate time for new bills that had not been introduced in the last session to be done, thereby interrupting lunchtime, or bringing it on before any of the bills came on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why it was not able to be put in a notice form is that I consider that every bill has a validity of its own and that the government has a legitimate and accepted right to say to the Senate why the bill is urgent enough to be debated without conforming to the commitment given to the Senate by Senator Gareth Evans about bills being introduced one session and debated the next session. I think it is an appropriate right of government to say that, but I also think it is a right of the Senate to hear that in the chamber and to decide in the chamber whether it is acceptable to it or not and to vote bill by bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting a motion of a general nature did not serve the purpose. I believe that negotiations behind the scenes are done on the basis of numbers rather than on the content of the bills. The validity of the government's reasons for departing from procedure is worthy of consideration in the chamber and should not be done behind the scenes. That is why I sought to do this. There is no other way of challenging bills as they come up without even further disruption to the process of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure Senator Ray that the Greens have no desire to debate any bills that have been introduced only in this session, with the government giving the Senate no opportunity to consider them. In a notice of motion I requested that the reasons for the practice be tabled. They were tabled, and I appreciate that, but there was no opportunity given for the Senate to decide whether those reasons were legitimate. I believe that the Senate has a legitimate decision making power. It should not be having to deal with bills on a day-by-day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray knows, I had to do a fair bit of research to find out when each of these bills was introduced and whether we had been given any reasons for their introduction. If we do not debate the motion today and we deal with bills that have been introduced only in this session, that makes it very difficult for the Greens to argue, as we strongly believe, that this should not be happening. We will raise this matter time and time again if the government does not face its responsibility to organise the program in such a way that only urgent bills&mdash;if the reasons for them are publicly available and agreed to&mdash;go through the Senate in the last 12 sitting days that we have left in parliament this year.

It may be the case that the commissioners will be elected in 1996 but, when this bill becomes law, it will talk about the establishment of the board.

Senator Campbell's reference to the board not being representative of small sets of interests is a fascinating point to make in support of this amendment. ATSIC is the primary source of policy advice to the government on Aboriginal affairs and ATSIC is the primary deliverer of the implementation of that policy advice in the administration of programs for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Therefore, it is appropriate for ATSIC to be appropriately represented on this board. The effect of the opposition amendment is to decrease that representation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Collins has said it all. The government would like to see the ILC operate as a mirror to ATSIC. What this Indigenous Land Corporation would end up being is an alter ego of ATSIC. That is a recipe for disaster because we have seen in recent times how the Aboriginal community has had varied opinions. I recall the evidence of Aden Ridgeway, who appeared before the Senate finance and public administration committee, when he said, `Of course there are going to be differences in views within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is only natural.' It is the same in the wider community. Therefore, we should not just accept the bureaucratic body which supposedly represents that community as being the be all and end all.

I can say that it is very judicious in doing that. It always makes sure that, where there is a difference of opinion amongst its commissioners, that is recorded and that is passed on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens will be supporting this amendment. We would have preferred ours, but this is definitely a fall-back position. I would like to say two things. There is a rationale for saying that there should be one commissioner from ATSIC rather than two when we consider that there are only seven members of the board in total and that possibly only five of those will be Aboriginal people. Under this arrangement we would have two out of the five members who are already represented within the ATSIC structure and representing the views of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to emphasise the difference between the ILC and ATSIC, even though both in their own way&mdash;but perhaps the ILC more so&mdash;are government appointed boards and de facto government bureaucracies. Nevertheless, because of the structure that we have seen emerging in this bill, this is yet another structure that is being created to conform to our white cultural understanding of a bureaucracy that distributes limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that there be only one commissioner, to emphasise the difference between the ILC and ATSIC.

One commissioner would have no less capacity to consult all the other commissioners before coming to a decision. One commissioner has no less capacity to report to the ILC board what all the other ATSIC commissioners feel&mdash;rather than simply a personal view or two personal views. Two people might be able to do it as well, but one person can do it just as well as two can. When I was here previously, when Senator Margetts was here, and when Senator Vallentine was here before that, we had a responsibility to glean the views of all the people to whom we felt we were accountable when we voted or spoke in this chamber. When there are two of us we both do that. It does not mean that we both would not, but it defeats Senator Kernot's argument that having two people is a mechanism for ensuring that two points of view are presented. One person, with the right attitudes towards representation of all views on that board, has that capacity. There is a trust in that person to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

The government has been making threats through the media that, if we do not comply with what the government wants in this legislation, it will give it all to ATSIC.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will simply make two quick points in response to what I have just heard. First of all, I am profoundly disappointed that the Greens are supporting this amendment. What Senator Ellison delivered was a bit rich. Senator Kernot made these points very succinctly, but I want to reiterate them. Senator Ellison said that one of the reasons why the opposition has proposed this amendment is that `ATSIC does not properly represent all of the Aboriginal people of Australia'. The coalition and the Greens, in supporting this, have a hide to keep chucking around the word `patronising' in respect of the government, because one cannot get much more patronising than what they have said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC is a body which is elected nationally in national elections which are funded to be run nationally. I know of the intense interest among Aboriginal people in participating in those ATSIC elections&mdash;interest which is growing, I might add, from election to election. Every Aboriginal person in Australia is entitled to nominate and stand for office and to cast a vote in those elections&mdash;in other words, it is precisely the same basis on which this parliament is elected. There is no better system available in this country. Having provided that democratic process and a democratic method of electing that body&mdash;as Senator Kernot said, rightly or wrongly, depending on which region elects whom&mdash;Senator Ellison is patronising enough to assert in here, on behalf of the opposition, that this body does not properly represent the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and final point I would like to make, and it should be an obvious one, is that there is an absolutely crucial need&mdash;considering the necessary interlinking of the job that the ILC will do and the programs that are delivered by ATSIC&mdash;for the ILC and ATSIC to be inextricably linked. One of the fundamental reasons for the level of ATSIC representation on this body, which was carefully considered by the government, is the essential link that has to exist between the ILC and ATSIC so that these programs can be delivered effectively on behalf of the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>

Secondly, in the appointment of all of the directors, the commission has a power that no other organisation in the country has. The part of clause 3 of the bill that the Greens unsuccessfully sought to amend last night provides that before a person can be appointed as a director, the minister must consult with the commission. He does not have to consult with anybody else. He does not have to consult with any other Aboriginal group or any other Aboriginal person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can talk about that afterwards. I will try to get to my argument. The reality is that Senator Collins is right when he says that the ATSIC commissioners are broadly representative because they are all elected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who all have the right to vote for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment does not say that there can be only one commissioner. It says that, as of right, there should be one commissioner and that all of the other commissioners should be broadly representative. Frankly, it is conceivable that every single board member of the ILC could be a commissioner. All we are enshrining is a very fine principle. It is not onerous to the extent that it requires the minister, as clause 3 of the bill does, to consult the commission in relation to the appointments. Clause 3 says he must consult the commission in relation to the appointment of the directors. So a name is put up&mdash;Senator Collins might be put up when he retires from here&mdash;and the commission has to be consulted. `Would former Minister Bob Collins be a good director of the ILC board?'

We are saying that, sure, this bill says that one of the directors will be an ATSIC commissioner and that the board should be broadly representative.

<PARA>I think I shocked Senator Evans when I referred to the government's amendments and the problems that the Greens have regarding the relationship between a national strategy and a regional strategy. We believe the regional strategy needs to be reflected within the national strategy. His solution was to remove the national strategy from any mention in the bill. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans did not actually ask the Greens whether they thought that was the solution to the dilemma. He decided and circulated amendments, and it is quite true that he then presumed that was very satisfactory to the Greens. As he did not consult us or the opposition, it remains for us to present amendments that we believe more satisfactorily address the dilemma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dilemma is this: in the bill as presented by the government the ILC board has the responsibility for developing a national indigenous land strategy and also a regional strategy. The bill does not actually spell out any relationship between the two; that goes along with the government's feeling that it should have maximum flexibility. However, our amendments are not necessarily about making the board more flexible and more open-ended in its powers&mdash;we see it essentially as a government appointed board, which it is&mdash;but about ensuring the accountability of the board to the wider Aboriginal community and on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, we have proposed some new clauses&mdash;I apologise for the confusion this causes&mdash;called J1A, J2A, J3A, J4A, J5A, J6, J7 and J8. The first five replace the Greens' previous J series and are a merger with the opposition amendments in relation to this matter. I think the opposition has agreed to withdraw its amendments and vote on these. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are an amalgamation, which does not, I might add, commit the opposition to having to support them totally. But we have agreed to move them as an amalgamation of the two to reduce the confusion over the issue in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people would like a bit more discussion on it, I will simply state what I believe the intention of these amendments is and then we can move to discussion of that. I think perhaps the most important one to raise here is J2A, where it basically says that the national indigenous land strategy is to be based on regional strategies. We believe it should be derived from and reflect the regional indigenous land strategies provided for under section 191N. Then we have a second clause that says that the national strategy should be  amended. If the regional strategy varies from time to time, the national strategy should be varied accordingly so that it continues to be based on, derived from and reflect the regional indigenous land strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that those regional strategies are developed in a way that gives consideration to the wider benefits of Aboriginal people throughout Australia, the J3A amendment covers the functions of the ILC in relation to that. The first one states that it should consult as widely as possible with representatives of those Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to whom the part is directed&mdash;presumably, every Aboriginal community in Australia which is in some way dispossessed. As every Aboriginal person is dispossessed&mdash;there is no disagreement on that&mdash;it means as wide a consultation as possible. It also states that the ILC must consult with the commission and that it may consult such other persons and bodies as the board considers appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not excluding a consultation with ATSIC, but is ensuring that regional strategies are developed regionally independent of any other existing organisations or structures that exist. It does not mean that those structures cannot be adopted as regional structures; it just means that there is no presupposition that that is the basis of regional consultation. It is about adopting a regional strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clauses that go on from that refer simply to a copy of those strategies being made available to the minister within two months of the board agreeing to them and that moneys are not to be distributed until the regional strategy is prepared. I think the reason for that is straightforward. Many people around Australia will feel that if a proper consultation process is not developed for this ILC land fund allocation, those who will be consulted last will have the last attempt at gaining any money from what we know to be a very diminishing fund. Therefore, we feel that the money should not be distributed until the regional strategy has been prepared by the board. The other amendments deal simply with consultation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the reason why we could not agree with Senator Evans's solution was that it is not sensible just to say it can be on a regional strategy. It is a reasonable request that a board would have some kind of national strategy either explicitly stated or implicitly operating. It is our position that it is better to have it explicitly stated because, as Senator Evans pointed out, then it can be found to relate to the regional strategies, and if it does not, that can be challenged. It is an accountability measure back to the Aboriginal community which is supposed to be the beneficiary of this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel it is inappropriate to strike out `national strategy.' We want a national strategy. We think that that national strategy's priorities should be set from the grassroots, from the regional strategies. We want it made explicit in this legislation so that those two mentions of `national' and `regional' do not give an implicit approval that a national strategy should be set and then regional people consulted about where they fit into it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be strongly opposing these amendments. I have a strong personal view about the actual effect on the ground of these amendments and how they will actually work in practice. I have got not the slightest doubt from my experience with the operation of Aboriginal organisations going back a very long time, that these amendments will be absolutely counterproductive. Strategies for different regions inevitably will reflect different aims. The national strategy cannot be based on all of them and still remain coherent and meaningful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government actually saw the point that the Greens were making and wanted to respond to it in an effective way. We saw the difficulty that may arise out of having two different but concurrent strategies that may be inconsistent. I wish to clarify the public record at this point, because I had a discussion about this last night with Senator Evans. I hope that Senator Chamarette, when she said that Senator Evans did not consult the Greens on this and just sprung it on them, was referring to the actual draft of the final amendment. Senator Evans told me explicitly last night that not only had he discussed this with Senator Chamarette, but he had done so in the presence of her advisers&mdash;good old Cathcart, who I know, and lawyers&mdash;and had proposed a solution to this problem having seen the merit of what Senator Chamarette was raising and, to quote Senator Evans, `The Greens had agreed with the concept.' That is why we went off and drafted the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make that absolutely clear. This is not something in terms of its philosophical base that has been sprung on the Greens. I do want to correct that. Senator Chamarette may have been referring to the actual drafted amendment. I am glad she has nodded and confirmed that. Senator Evans did say to me last night that the very reason we drafted these amendments was because he felt, after that discussion, that he had the Greens support for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was proposing, in the amendment that we have circulated, to go one step further and remove the explicit requirement in the legislation to have a national strategy. We want these organisations to be regionally based for the simple reason that we do know that the needs and requirements differ so widely across Australia from region to region. Of course the organisation, by necessary inference, would develop its national strategy simply by considering the regional strategies that come before it. That would be the actual effect of the government amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national strategy would be adopted, by necessity, through the organisation having regard to those regional strategies and developing a national strategy as a result. If that is not acceptable, the simplest way for us to proceed here today in expediting the passage of the bill, if there is going to be support for this, would be to withdraw the government amendment, and I am happy to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure Senator Chamarette that the government gave serious consideration to her concerns. This was a genuine attempt to respond to them. As I said, having thought about it again, we were prepared to go one step further and remove the requirement which, at the end of the day, may result in having two concurrent strategies that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is&mdash;to use that much worn expression; it has been given a fair old hiding in this debate&mdash;that we could end up with strategies that conflict. If we are going to have a coherent national strategy, it is impossible to give consideration to every single regional strategy. For those reasons, we oppose these amendments. If debate indicates that the numbers are there to support them, I simply indicate as a courtesy to the committee that we will withdraw the government amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to that because I think it needs clarification. It is true that two of us had a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and his advisers. When Senator Evans heard our concerns, he immediately saw the validity of them. He might have agreed with them himself and worked on a solution that he felt was adequate to address the concerns he perceived, but we said we would go away and think about it. We received a copy of the amendments, but at no point did Senator Evans come back and ask us if they had addressed our concerns adequately. That is the reason why our amendments quite clearly present a different option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe it illustrates that we have not had enough consultation on this matter. We certainly do not believe it is a deliberate attempt not to consult. At the moment, it is a process of communication by circulation of amendments. Senator Evans thought he understood our concerns and had the solution, which he drafted and circulated. Perhaps he should have noticed when we circulated different amendments that his amendments did not address all the concerns that we raised with him. He may have misunderstood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, in our minds, we knew that we could not agree to something until we had seen the solution in writing. We expected to come back and have a discussion about it. We have repeatedly written letters to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Evans asking for discussion before we have gone public on any of our concerns about this legislation. We felt that, if the government wanted the bill to go through, it would be sensible to discuss it with those people who supported the spirit in which it was being put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an illustration of where there has been an attempt of goodwill on the part of the government to try to meet our concerns. The reality is that it has not met our concerns, and that is why we are presenting this different series of amendments. I thank the minister for withdrawing the government's amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. There are examples in Australia and around the world of similar organisations that have regional requirements and a national perspective. We can think of many such organisations. Just about any national company, be it a property company or a company that sells cars, hamburgers or anything nationally, has a national strategy, be it for marketing, administration or anything else. They would also have regional, state or local strategies. That is quite sensible. That is why the coalition has always thought that the concept of a national strategy is plain commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that we brought to the committee&mdash;specifically our amendment No. 18, which has now been incorporated in J3A; our amendment No. 19, which has become J4A, under the J series; and Nos 22, 23 and 24, which have become J6 and J7 respectively&mdash;are all to deal with the consultation and accountability involved in a national strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposal in the legislation quite properly says that there should be a strategy&mdash;and it looks at the sorts of things the strategy should consider. We believe that the strategy should be a broad objectives document. It cannot fall into the trap that Senator Collins envisages of having to represent in finite detail the piece-by-piece minutiae of the regional strategies. We do, however, believe that it should reflect what is in the region. There cannot be a national strategy that does not take into account what is in the regions. That is why we agree with the Greens broader philosophy that the national strategy must reflect what is happening in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to come back to the government's scheme, it creates the strategy and no-one other than the board knows what the strategy is. We believe there will be a hell of a lot of people in Australia, particularly Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, who will be interested in what the strategy is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core of our proposals, in summary, is to ensure that the national strategy, to begin with, is the subject of consultation, not only with the commission but also with a broader group of people. We believe that at the regional level the strategy should also be the subject of consultation not just with the ATSIC regional office but also with other Aboriginal organisations in the regions. As we all know, there is a whole range of Aboriginal organisations which will have an interest in this. Although the act says that the ILC could consult with anyone it wants, we think that it would be entirely inappropriate for it not to be required to consult with Aboriginal organisations that do have an interest in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally when it comes to regional strategies&mdash;and I am trying to cover the whole rationale behind the coalition's view of this series of amendments&mdash;we believe that, when going into a region and developing a land management program, it is quite stupid not to be talking to the state or local government that has jurisdiction in the area. In just about every state of Australia, as Senator Collins would know, state governments have programs which relate to providing land and support for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I think it is plain commonsense that, before the ILC comes along to a region, it should at least make itself aware of the goals and plans the state government&mdash;and, where necessary, the local government, but particularly the state government&mdash;has in respect of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, it would be quite stupid of the ILC to go to a town like Broome, which is familiar to me, and not talk to the Court government about the plans that it has for in and around Broome. Senator Chamarette and I might have disagreements about what those plans are. Broadly speaking, the government has plans to improve Aboriginal access to and ownership of land around Broome&mdash;a town that has become famous around Australia for its fantastic Aboriginal culture, its crocodiles and its tourism potential. This is a classic case of where it would be absolutely mad for the ILC to enter into a regional strategy in the Kimberleys&mdash;a strategy which would include towns like Broome&mdash;while not being aware of the plans of the state government. I think it is very sensible that the ILC be required to consult with the state in relation to its plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I am not so familiar with the plans of other states, I am sure that would apply equally to places like the Northern Territory and Queensland. I am sure Senator Kernot would know about the Queensland government's plans. I am not familiar with them, but I am sure that the Queensland government has programs that specifically deal with land for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I do not know enough about the Queensland situation, but it would be absurd if the ILC went to Queensland and did not talk to the Goss government and its people about their plans in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some final points about our plans. We plan, firstly, to increase the consultation and, secondly, to ensure that strategies are made available to those who wish to see them. As I said, under the government's scheme the strategies will be set out in a document for the board but no-one else to know about. We have a plan to ensure that the strategies are tabled at least here so that anyone who wants them knows where they are and so that they can become the subject of public consideration and discussion, if that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the broad thrust of the coalition's proposals. Based on those arguments, we indicate that we will be supporting most of what the Greens are proposing. As I have said, a number of the provisions&mdash;J6, J7, J3A and J4A; specifically, 18, 19, 22, 23 and 24&mdash;are effectively amendments that were drafted by the coalition. We will be supporting them. However, we have a problem with the concept of the tail wagging the dog. We do not think the national strategy needs to be or should be amended every time there is a change in the regional strategy. We think the regional strategies need to be tied together. We cannot just have a whole bunch of potentially, as Senator Collins quite properly says, inconsistent strategies. There needs to be a national perspective. I think it is important to address particularly the point made by the minister that it is important that the national strategy takes into account the regional strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has talked about the problems of having concurrent strategies that are inconsistent or conflicting. Quite clearly, if we take the bottom up approach, where we look at the regions first and then devise the national strategy, there is no reason at all why it should be inconsistent. All the regions have different demands and different needs. They therefore require entirely different strategies, one would expect. As Senator Ellison has said by way of example on many occasions, the strategy that would relate to urban fringe-dwelling communities in Sydney or the Swan Valley in Perth would be extremely different from those for the Kimberleys, the Northern Territory or Cape York. So we will have very different regional approaches and regional strategies, and that is quite proper. It is crucial, therefore, that the national strategy takes those into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with the minister when he says that we could have a national strategy that is inconsistent and conflicting. The national strategy should be a broad directional document that provides the strategic railroad for the ILC to run down for&mdash;as the bill provides&mdash;a three to five year time span. It is important that once the strategy has been put in place, once it has been the subject of consultation, and once it has been the subject of public scrutiny and tabling in this place, it should stay in place until the time provided in the act for it to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this set of proposed coalition amendments we are also suggesting further parliamentary scrutiny by the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title. That would provide another level of potential input by the community. As the joint committee moves around Australia we will be able to take evidence in relation to the strategies and all the other operations of the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the nub of what the coalition is looking for. To summarise: we want more consultation with Aboriginal groups; consultations with the states that have existing land programs; more accountability so that the strategies are subject to public scrutiny; and, finally, a strategy developed that is coordinated and consistent. I think that can be achieved under this scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing these amendments. We feel that it is a completely unnecessary imposition on the ILC to make this kind of consultation a mandatory requirement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I am indebted to Senator Campbell for his example. I will make sure that Aboriginal organisations in Western Australia are well aware that the Greens are very happy to support a mandatory requirement for them, in the formulation of their regional and national policies, to consult with the Court government of Western Australia. Something has suddenly occurred to me in respect of the attitude of that government to all Aboriginal issues&mdash;which has been one of obstructionism and white-anting, but mostly obstructionism. If this amendment is carried, with the support of the Greens, it will be a mandatory requirement that this consultation be carried out. What will be the situation if the Court government of Western Australia simply declines to consult, thereby having the effect of blocking that from happening at all under this legislation? I do not place any weight on that, but I simply say that I am indebted to Senator Campbell. Aboriginal organisations in Western Australia will appreciate the support of the Greens in imposing on them a mandatory requirement, in developing their own Aboriginal regional and national strategies, to consult with the Court government of Western Australia. </PARA>

I do wonder, though, whether it is wise to say that the national strategy `must be based on, derived from and reflect'. I wonder whether that is just too prescriptive. We have all heard in this debate about the force of the word `must.' Senator Campbell said that he wanted the national strategy to be a broad directional document.

Senator Chamarette talks about ensuring `that regional indigenous land strategies complement existing state, territory or regional land acquisition and management programs'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree. They are very important questions and it is very important that we consider all the implications of what we are putting in place. I thank the people who have contributed. I think Senator Collins raised&mdash;as Senator Kernot did&mdash;the mandatory requirement implied by the use of the word `must'. Amendment J7(a) says that the board `must consult, as far as practicable' with everybody. That is a recognition that, even if we consult right throughout Australia with every particular Aboriginal community we know of, there may still be others we never get to. So that is a recognition of the impossibility of the extent of consultation that is required. It leaves leeway for the board to consult as far as it practicably can, to say what the limitations have been and to accept that there will be limitations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, state governments are stationary bodies. Western Australians know that only too well. Therefore, we feel happy to support this amendment because we do not think there is anything to be gained by being blissfully unaware of the state government's stance, whether it is one we agree with or not, when we are making plans. It is a matter of courtesy to consult but, more than that, it is wise. It is foolish to set up regional strategies that do not take into consideration any new information the state governments may have. They might hide it and not give it to us; but that is beside the point. We should give them every opportunity to do so. It is a bit like Senator Gareth Evans assuming that his amendments had solved all our problems and not asking us whether we had a different idea. That is all that is implied here. I believe that, within the cabinet, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) must consult the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) before export woodchip licences are issued. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the government to rethink its refusal to support our amendments at this point. As Senator Evans was so generous spirited as to contemplate the removal of the words `national strategy', he has already given in-principle agreement to the regional strategies being the most appropriate ones to be mentioned in devising a strategy at all. That has underlain the spirit of the amendments that the government put and then withdrew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the only things that the government can be said to be disagreeing on are: consultation on a broad representative basis with the regions as far as is practical; and consultation with state or territory governments that are relevant to each region. So I want the government to reconsider that, if possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The in-principle acceptance that regional strategies are the logical base by which to move forward is accepted by the government's willingness to write out the words `national strategy' throughout the bill. Only a very little is being added to that. So it needs to be on the record that that is what the government opposes&mdash;it actually opposes having anything that guarantees regional groups that they will be consulted, or that the board will attempt to consult them as far as practical. And it writes out of the bill any responsibility that the ILC might feel it needs to state and territory governments relevant to those regions on the issues that it wishes to put in place. I think there are two very good reasons why we should have those provisions, and I am amazed that that is the basis on which the government is not supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>I am not saying that we are going to support this but, from Senator Chamarette's own philosophical base, I am suggesting that the questions Senator Kernot has raised are absolutely pertinent to this issue. If the Greens put a full stop after that, they might not be in the trouble they are going to get into. The problem is the hook that they then get into. The proposed amendment to clause 3 says that the board must consult to ensure that regional indigenous land strategies complement each state, territory, etc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of being able to lay this organisation wide open to mischief-making by state governments the requirement is, in Senator Campbell's words, to consult with the Court government in Western Australia. We should not just consult with it, which is how Senator Chamarette has very mildly portrayed this amendment just now, but ensure that that consultation results in a decision that these things complement state government programs. What if the state government of Western Australia refuses to consult or says, and I am sure it will, that anything that is being proposed by this organisation flatly contradicts what is being done by the state government of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot said, it is a value judgment that then has to be reached. There are questions that need to be asked: who reaches it; who makes that decision; who determines at the end of the day whether the requirements of this clause have been fulfilled; and who makes that decision? The problem is that if Senator Chamarette amends this section to comply with the explanation she has just given to the chamber, there might not be such a major problem. But that is a substantial hook that then goes in afterwards. If Senator Chamarette put in a full stop and deleted those other words, the proposed amendment might be in better shape. </PARA>

When the ILC is considering regionally, after consultation with regional groups, what the needs are in Western Australia, then with that $3 million, which, believe me, is not going to go far, it needs to find out what areas are going to be the easiest to access and what areas are going to be the most difficult to access.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Court government is fundamentally opposed to the constitutional abuses contained in the Native Title Act.

Our obligations and requirements under section 206 of the Native Title Act are that our committee is to go around the country and consult with state governments to see how the Native Title Act is going. When we set out to do that, the committee&mdash;of which Senator Chamarette is a member&mdash;decided that we would go to New South Wales and Queensland, specifically Sydney and Brisbane.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise to speak on the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1994. The bill enables the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, known as AQIS, to refund money to various industry groups it has overcharged. The refund will take the form of a rebate. This decision vindicates the concerns of industry groups who succeeded in persuading AQIS to establish an industry charging review committee. The committee subsequently found that AQIS had overcharged those industries by about $13 million and that the money should be rebated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, this bill amends the Quarantine Act to provide a limited remission power to apply to fees for quarantine services. The remission power will allow for revenue collections which are surplus to cost recovery requirements in any year to be returned to the relevant industry groups in the form of uniform fee rebates in the following year. It is proposed that $6.1 million will be rebated through this legislation and $6.9 million through regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The affected industry groups and potential rebates are: processed food exports, $1.319 million; plant exports, $4.732 million; live animal exports, $0.94 million; post entry plant quarantine, $0.476 million; seaport quarantine, $0.774 million; airport quarantine, $1.132 million; and import clearance, $3.724 million. I understand the industries have been consulted about the rebates. Some have agreed to use part of the money for specific projects such as quality assurance facilitation and residue testing programs. However, the bulk will be used to provide fee rebates during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that in mind it is timely to reflect on the role of AQIS. Over the years, AQIS has been condemned for obstructing the development of primary industry in this country, and for inefficiency, irresponsibility and inhibiting competitiveness. Let me quote a letter from Mr Nick Truelove, the managing director of a small, innovative meat exporter called the True Foods Corporation. In November 1993 he wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have had nothing but obstruction, discouragement and costly problems from your Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite frankly I have become so sick and tired of it (AQIS obstruction) that if I had not been a farmer and ultimately dependent on export business for the survival of the family property I would have long since chucked it in and gone into an easier business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS is the greatest single impediment to Australian meat exports and is costing Australian farmers who it is ostensively set up to serve, dearly.</PARA>
<PARA>That is damning criticism, but justified in the context of a series of examples that highlight the burden of 100 per cent cost recovery, excess staff and inefficient practices within the AQIS organisation. One example is meat inspection. The average meat inspector earns around $30,000 a year, but is charged out to the abattoir at over $70,000&mdash;well in excess of AQIS's 100 per cent cost recovery. If that is not bad enough, an Australian inspector only manages about 79 carcases a shift, while an American inspector gets through more than three times that amount, with around 300 carcases a shift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has frequently highlighted the problems with AQIS. I am well aware of the work of my colleague Senator David Brownhill, who has made a particular effort to concentrate on this particular program and effort. While my colleagues and I support the bill now before us, we wish to place on record our continuing frustration with the government and its refusal to act decisively on AQIS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully support all the remarks made by my colleague Senator Tambling. This bill gives AQIS the power to refund to industries money it has overcharged. It is hardly a piece of legislation that one is likely to oppose. Senator Tambling has already outlined the groups and the moneys involved for some $13 million currently. Of more importance, this overcharging is another administrative flaw in the operation of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This service is our flagship to the world in terms of quarantine standards. We have an enviable record in Australia of being disease free in so many areas. The current drought and the need to import grains highlight the almost unique position we have in Australia. We need to import grain, but our grain industries are free of so many diseases, fungi and bugs that are found elsewhere, that import protocols are having to be developed to protect us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We rely on AQIS to protect our industries; we rely on its  integrity and attention to detail. Yet, last year we had example after example of AQIS making mistakes at the administrative level. We have had relatively minor matters of travel irregularities, the Audit Office has been concerned about auditing practices and now, as a result of industries complaining about charges, we have this bill to pay back money that AQIS has wrongly collected. The need for this legislation reiterates my ongoing concerns about AQIS and the need for an objective and thorough examination of its administration and operation. I moved for an inquiry to see what reforms have been put in place in regard to AQIS&mdash;quality assurance and all those other things.

This bill amends the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 by introducing a conversion factor which will allow the levy to be calculated where only a cold carcase weight is available. The bill also proposes other minor amendments to levy acts. The levies collected for research and development, promotion, disease eradication and the residue survey, are currently calculated on a hot weight basis. The difficulty arises when the carcase weighed cold produces a lighter weight. This legislation introduces a conversion factor of 1.03 which allows for a weight reduction of three per cent for chilled or frozen meat and provides the hot carcase weight equivalent for levy calculation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where neither the hot nor cold carcase weight is determined, a deemed carcase weight of 240 kilograms will be assumed in order to calculate the levy.

The maximum fine is 60 penalty units, the current penalty unit being $100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill makes it clear that an agent, if involved in the sale of cattle, is responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy to the Commonwealth. The abattoir proprietor will only become responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy if an agent is not involved. Abattoir proprietors can also refuse to slaughter livestock, including pigs owned by someone else, unless levy payments are first made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meat processing is one of Australia's largest rural based industries. It employs more than 30,000 Australians, generates about $5.6 billion turnover a year, and is gaining increasing recognition and market share in Asia. Currently, more than 75,000 farms and pastoral properties in Australia produce livestock for slaughter. Together, beef and veal are our fourth largest export earner, generating $2,949 million a year. Certainly, the GATT outcome promises more opportunities for the Australian beef industry in the United States, Japan and Korea. Other breakthroughs are likely in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Canada and Mexico.

Furthermore, some 117 candidates stood for 17 positions and, as a result, the ballot paper was a metre wide. There were 108 different parties and nine independents. Apart from the Liberal and Labor parties, there were parties variously called Party! Party! Party!, Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and Surprise Party.

This significant volatility in the labour force surveys seasonally adjusted series over recent months is not unusual. The key issue is the unambiguously positive underlying trend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that Premier Fahey must have missed the answer that I gave to Senator Sandy Macdonald on this issue on Monday, but it is not surprising that not many people would be watching question time. Premier Fahey has said that he has had no formal response. Let me point out that Premier Fahey, in his four-page, very detailed letter to the Prime Minister, raised many drought issues, of which the army assisting in water movement was contained in just one paragraph. I have had previous experience of writing letters to the New South Wales government. If you get an answer within three months, you are lucky. But that did not stop Premier Fahey two days later again berating us in the press for not giving him a formal answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier, in his letter, calls for a general assurance that, should the need for transporting water arise, the defence forces would be available to assist. There is no specific detail of what assistance is required. There has been no approach from the New South Wales State Emergency Service to Emergency Management Australia; nor has there been any approach to the Commonwealth from the drought relief coordinator. In fact, New South Wales has not even inquired as to what capacity the armed forces have for water transport, purification or storage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the Premier's letter, Emergency Management Australia has made inquiries of both those organisations. What is clear is that the situation facing drought affected towns in New South Wales is changing on a day-to-day basis in response to localised storms and the emergency measures being taken. It is also apparent that New South Wales has not yet determined what assistance, if any, it requires in water transport from the Commonwealth; they are continuing to assess the tanker capacity available in New South Wales. It would seem that there is excess capacity available through commercial tankers which are not being utilised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the New South Wales government to come forward with specific requests through appropriate channels. No-one wants a repeat of the Nyngan floods, when New South Wales ignored all the existing procedures and complained afterwards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent assistance provided to the Queensland government in support of bushfire prevention is a prime example of the Commonwealth quickly and effectively responding when the appropriate procedures are followed. The fact that the New South Wales government has not followed up on these issues leads me to draw one of two conclusions: either New South Wales has not got its act together, or Premier Fahey is playing politics. The fact that the Premier's very general request arrived on Monday, and his condemnation occurred on Wednesday, can only lead me to the second conclusion. I assume there must be a state election in the offing in New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question asks whether we will pursue unilateral trade negotiations with the US. We always do. Irrespective of what multilateral trade negotiations are current, we always press unilaterally for particular trade advantages in areas where we perceive a necessity for that. I might say that, when we balance the size of the Australian economy and the international clout that we have against the size of the United States economy and the international clout that it has, unless we can point to particular areas of strong leverage in bilateral negotiations, it is a hard thing to do with a major country like the United States. It is far better for us to work within the structure of multilateral trade negotiations on major issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a brief on the US presidential elections and, since I am representing the minister, perhaps I should refer to it. It says that if the United States does not obtain the authority during the forthcoming special session of Congress to accept the World Trade Organisation agreement, it would be a factor affecting the timing of entry into force of the World Trade Organisation agreement, which is to be considered at the implementation conference scheduled to be held on 8 December this year. It is speculative to consider what the Congress may do with the Uruguay Round implementing legislation in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is speculative because the new members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate elected yesterday will not be sworn until 1 January 1995. The Uruguay Round implementing legislation is due to be considered at a special congressional session in late November-early December and thus will be considered by the members who currently hold their seats prior to the newly elected members coming on board. This was anticipated in the lead-up to the congressional elections when the leaders of all parties indicated to the President passage of the Uruguay Round legislation. That is why it is all in the realms of speculation, and speculation into which it is not appropriate for me to delve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other questions, I can inform the Senate that the benefits that accrue to Australia from the Uruguay Round outcomes are part of the global endeavour. That is, they do not come exclusively from the United States; they come from our negotiations with Europe and other countries, including Japan. Obviously, the securing of these outcomes is dependent on the World Trade Organisation being joined by the major powers and on when it comes into operation itself. We are therefore consistently pursuing all of the macro-economic reform settings and the trade and industry policies directed to improving our international competitiveness in the expectation that the World Trade Organisation is established and that lower trade barriers exist so that we can take advantage of the Uruguay Round outcomes. But it also helps us improve the efficiency of the Australian economy and makes us more competitive, which makes it worth doing in its own right.</PARA>

It is an economy in strong growth. As we see today from the average weekly earnings figures, it is growth that is not being fuelled by wage-push inflation. Strong growth and low inflation&mdash;these are the problems of a growing economy.</PARA>

This is a growing economy. The adjustments to interest rates which the Reserve Bank has undertaken, in the first instance, have not been fully passed on to home borrowers. Indeed, there is clear evidence of competition among banks, given the more competitive settings we have been able to introduce to ensure that there is still strong competition between them, not to pass on the full extent of the adjustments. Secondly, the purpose of making those adjustments is to ensure that inflation is kept under control or that larger interest rate adjustments do not occur in the future. In other words, they come into the category of responsibly managing an economy; that is what the Reserve Bank has tried to do, I believe successfully.

But the best measure for an accurate picture of what is happening in the earnings area is average weekly ordinary time earnings.

In seasonally adjusted and original terms, growth in average weekly ordinary time earnings in the year to August is 0.4 per cent lower&mdash;that is, a reduction&mdash;than it was in the year to May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other salient factor of this index that was released today is that the labour force survey indicates that part-time employment grew faster than full-time employment between May and August. Thus, the higher AWE figure cannot be explained by a reduction in the proportion of part-time employment. It is therefore likely&mdash;and I am quoting from the brief here&mdash;that the higher AWE growth is attributable to part-time employees working longer hours. In other words, not only are more Australians in work, as the employment figures have indicated, but the tendency is for those Australians in work to work longer and to earn more money in overtime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental message in these figures is that there is no wage push on inflation. These figures are well below the inflation level; they are not exerting any upward push on inflation at all. Businesses that have regard to these figures can now factor into their long-term planning very low inflation horizons for the future.</PARA>

If we take these figures as well in terms of what is happening in the labour market, we have to consider that during the year 1993-94 productivity rose by 1.6 per cent in the community. A lot of the higher earnings that I have referred to are because wage increases have been generated by productivity increases; in other words, productivity is fuelling the economy and there is no cost push pressure of the sort that we saw during the Fraser years. That is a reference, too, to the fact that this government has been successful in generating workplace bargaining in the enterprise based on productivity as a way of capturing wage increases for workers in the community.

I gave an undertaking to ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for information, and he has very promptly provided it to me. Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background I understand Australia Post is currently implementing an extensive modernisation of its retail network, known as Retail Post, which focuses on better meeting customer needs while eliminating over time the significant losses incurred by the network.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market surveys have confirmed Australia Post's view that customers want the convenience of one-stop shopping.

Husbands in families will lose the benefit of the deduction that they previously had under the dependent spouse rebate. That is making things difficult for those families when budgeting. I would contrast the difference between this scheme and the child-care rebate which is not means tested and which can be obtained so easily.

That legislation amended the operation of Australia Post to some small degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister does not seem to recognise that there is an inherent inconsistency in Australia Post operating in this way. He says that under the existing act it is quite allowable and quite acceptable for Australia Post to set up stationery shops. It is not simply the postal services that are expanding or being added to. Australia Post is setting up specific stationery shops which will sell writing instruments, pads, books, envelopes, accessories, filing and storage material, business machine supplies, social stationery&mdash;a wide range of stationery items. As I said in my question, the shops will sell ballpoint pens, marking pens and rollerball pens produced by private sector manufacturers such as Fabercastel, Pentel, Bic and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these sorts of items will be selling in these shops in direct competition with the private sector, particularly stationery shops, which by and large are part of the small business sector.

It did not allow extended competition with Australia Post in the provision of direct mail services. In a whole range of other postal services, the legislation that went through this chamber continued the monopoly powers of Australia Post in the provision of postal services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to also make some comments about the question asked of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Senator Schacht) about the latest unemployment figures. The tragedy of unemployment in Australia is ongoing. Every Australian will welcome the upturn in the economy after Australia's deepest recession in 60 years and the highest unemployment rate in living memory. The reality is that for young Australians&mdash;on whom I now have to focus a lot of attention as the shadow minister with responsibility for youth affairs&mdash;the government's Working Nation document aims to reduce unemployment in Australia to five per cent by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made very well yesterday by Julian Pocock, Executive Director of APAC, the peak youth organisation. For young Australians, this means that the federal government has adopted an unemployment target of 15 per cent. Julian made a very good point yesterday when he said that politicians should go to primary schools because, by the year 2000, it is young Australians now in grade six who will be entering the employment market. He said that we need to pick out 15 per cent of the children in a class of 30 and say, `The Australian Labor Party's policy is to ensure that 15 per cent of your class will be highly unlikely to get a full-time job in the year 2000.' That is the human tragedy that Senator Macdonald referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must all welcome the turnaround and growth in employment. We must also look at the other problems in the Australian economy. The poor people who get jobs these days have bought houses in the hope of an economic recovery. A hell of a lot of people have believed the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), who are saying that we have this brilliant recovery, and have bought a house. More people have bought houses in the last year or so than ever before. We have been told, `It is all hunky-dory. The economy is going along very nicely.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what happens? We had the admission by Senator Cook in another answer today that interest rates are going up and that that is just a natural part of a booming economy. As Senator Kemp interjected, if interest rates hit 20 per cent, will that mean we have got a really good economy? We are heading into double digit interest rates again. Those in middle Australia with the Australian dream of owning a home are now being forced to pay $100 or more a month extra for the privilege of having a house and a mortgage, and $100 would go a heck of a long way towards paying for a week's groceries. I know in my home we used to be able to buy a week's groceries for $100. For mum and dad with a couple of kids and their grocery bill, by the time interest rates reach the 11 or 12 per cent mark, they will be up to $100 to $150 a month worse off. That will impact on middle Australia very badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald made the point that fundamental reform of the Australian economy means getting away from centralised labour laws. We have seen the most massive centralisation of labour laws in Australian history in the last two years&mdash;more central control than ever before. We have training systems that are not working. We have a community sector which is dealing with the problems of youth unemployment, youth homelessness, youth suicide, youth drug abuse, vandalism, crime and graffiti. Non-profit community organisations such as the Salvation Army and the Central City Mission&mdash;a whole range of community initiated groups&mdash;are struggling to meet these overwhelming needs, and we have this crisis out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is promising young Australians a 15 per cent youth unemployment rate by the year 2000. I do not think any of us can accept that that is a worthy target. So every time these employment figures come through, we should, of course, welcome them. Every time someone who has been unemployed gets a job, that is a welcome relief for one family somewhere in Australia. But we should never lose sight of those young Australians, particularly in the 15- to 25-year-old age group, who have no hope of getting a job. They are totally dejected about the training schemes. They know that they go into many of these training schemes, come out at the other end and there are still no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though, as Senator Kernot pointed out, retention rates are rising, what Mr Pocock pointed out yesterday, quite rightly, was that the retention rates do not look at what is happening to kids under the age of 15. We have the greatest drop-out rate and truancy rates that this nation has ever seen. We have the highest youth suicide rates in the world. It is a national disgrace. It comes back to the failure by this government to implement fundamental economic reforms&mdash;reforms that could change the lives of so many Australians right across this nation. </PARA>

Every time he hears the strains of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>, what ought to be going through his mind is that he and his party&mdash;he as Treasurer and then as Prime Minister&mdash;have created a situation whereby what we now have is `advance Australia unfair'. That is exactly what is happening in this country. So every time he hears the national anthem, I hope he hears that refrain&mdash;`advance Australia unfair'&mdash;because that is exactly what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke said to us that by 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. It is a memorable quote, and we keep reminding members of the Labor Party that that is what he said. I suppose they cringe when they hear that, too&mdash;like they ought to cringe when they hear the national anthem. Two years later, on 12 April 1989, Mr Keating said in parliament:</PARA>

<PARA>of the new tax scales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we will achieve this year the child poverty benchmarks promised by the Prime Minister&mdash;well ahead of the 1990 target.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating blithely makes these sorts of promises. He tells us that we will have tax cuts that are l-a-w and, as soon as the election is over, those tax cuts disappear. He tells pensioners that they will be taken out of the tax system and, five days after the election, that promise disappears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, all that is being advanced in this country is in fact a lack of fairness. What we are seeing is an ever increasing gap between the rich and the poor. The fact is that almost 700,000 Australian children are living in poverty in 1994. We can flip figures around so that they do not sound very much. But we are talking about 700,000 children. That is a disgrace. For those of us who grew up in a country in respect of which we were proud to use the words `advance Australia fair', it is a disgrace that there are 700,000 children currently living in poverty. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating said earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are saying as a society we won't have an underclass. If the Americans want an underclass they can have one. If the British want an underclass they can have one. But we won't have one.</PARA>
<PARA>I have news for Mr Keating: Australia now ranks third amongst western countries in the unequal distribution of income for families&mdash;just below the UK and the US. Australia also ranks third in terms of the lowest proportion of income in the hands of the poorest 20 per cent. The message to Mr Keating is that we have an underclass and it has developed over the 11 years that he has been pulling the levers in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony of the situation we now find ourselves in is that Australia has always prided itself on being an egalitarian country where most people are relatively well off and the differential between the rich and the poor is not as great as in many other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is increasingly not the case under this current government. A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 3 November read `Something's rotten in the land of fair go'. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We Australians like to think we live in a pretty egalitarian country, so that while there are some rich people and some poor people, most of our national wealth is divided up with the evenhandedness you'd expect of a society without an inherited class structure. And if there were some inequalities in the past, 11 years of government by a party committed to a fair distribution of income would certainly have ironed them out. Not so!</PARA>
<PARA>They have not been ironed out; they have been made worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would have us believe that we live in an era of social nirvana. We have only to look at three important measures and their social indicators to comprehend the huge deception being perpetrated by this government. If we look at the number of long-term unemployed in this country, we see that the number is exploding. Last year or the year before I predicted that we would have 300,000 long-term unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember former Senator Richardson mocking me across the chamber because I had the audacity to predict that there would be 300,000 long-term unemployed. We now have 410,000 people unemployed. I wonder whether he would laugh at those predictions across the chamber now. As I said, he mocked me across the chamber because I said that I thought in a year's time we would have 300,000 long-term unemployed people. Unfortunately, I have been shown to be correct. Worse than that, the figure is much higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that causes the gap between the rich and the poor in this country to widen is that this government has allowed the net foreign debt to increase seven-fold from the time it came to power. In 1983 the net foreign debt was $23 billion; in June of this year it was $161 billion. We cannot continue to live beyond our means in that way without there being ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ramifications of living beyond our means is that we see an ever growing gap between the rich and the poor. We only have to look at some of the facts. Sole parents continue to be the group most likely to be in poverty. About one in every five sole parents lives in poverty, and there are estimated to be 232,000 people living in poverty in sole parent families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second most likely group to be living in poverty, just under one in every five, is the younger singles, or the non-elderly single people. Couples with children are the third group most at risk with 12 per cent being below the Henderson poverty line. There are an estimated 933,000 people in couple with children families who are living below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government's response to this undeniably shameful record? It is painfully predictable. When Mr Keating answered a question the other day he rolled out his script, rolled out the sort of lines that he likes to use to salve his conscious and hide the figures and the facts. How did he explain that the rich had got richer and the poor had got poorer, and that this had increased over the 11 years that Labor has been in power? He did not have the answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating stood there, he shot the messengers in the foot by castigating the reports of people who have said that this is happening. He gave us a whole lot of figures. He fudged around. He did not tell us the facts in the answer to that question. He said that the Labor government had addressed poverty through employment growth, through transfer payments of over $6 billion such as family allowance, et cetera, and through tax cuts. Then he said&mdash;I found this amazing&mdash;that the tax-free threshold is $5,400. In 1983, when the coalition was in government, it was $4,750. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking those figures into account in terms of the rate of inflation, if the tax-free threshold was going to be at the level it was in 1983, it should be around $8,500. How he could stand there and give us the tax-free threshold figure&mdash;considering what it was in 1983 and what it is now&mdash;and not index it is beyond my comprehension. But that is the sort of fudging he does all the time. He makes the figures fit his story, which is fallacy, which is fabricated and which does not hide anything from the Australian public, because they know. They see poverty every day; they see people lining up at the welfare agencies looking for assistance and help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He either ignores or he does not realise&mdash;but I do not think that is the case; I think he most probably chooses to ignore&mdash;the statements made recently by a large number of people who are highly regarded in this area. For example, the director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Dr Peter Saunders, stated that poverty grew rapidly in the 1980s despite growth in employment and the introduction of the family allowance supplement for workers on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994 the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a study called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Social Trends</EMPHASIS>, a survey which showed that since Labor came to power, Australia has experienced growing income inequality, rising welfare dependency, greater family breakdown, the emergence of a working poor and an alarming surge in the suicide rate of young men. Those figures are there for us to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Bureau of Immigration and Population Research study, commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, released on 30 September 1994 found that an increasing number of children from non-English speaking backgrounds are living in poverty and sometimes going without food or adequate clothing. Then we see another study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, University of Canberra, a report released in the middle of this year. Professor Ann Harding reported that the rise in unemployment and the decline in full-time male employment between 1990 and 1993 would lead to a greater increase in inequality in the early 1990s than was experienced in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Ann Harding again presented a paper titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poverty and Inequality in September 1994</EMPHASIS> to the ACOSS national congress which reported that 11 per cent of Australians now live in after-house poverty. How many studies and how many reports does Mr Keating have to see before he will admit that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor, brought on and induced by this Labor government and its policies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the greatest gap is between those families that we read about in those reports&mdash;those families who are struggling to pay their electric light bills, to find somewhere to live and to keep food on the table for their children&mdash;and Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, who is spending his time planning his retirement in his $2.2 million house. That is where the biggest gap is, between the poor in Australia and our rich Prime Minister, who chooses to engage in buying French clocks and a $2.2 million house. `Advance Australia unfair' is the refrain we ought to be hearing in our national anthem. </PARA>

We have not been singing it for all that long. We would like to think that Australia is a fair and even country. This year in my state we are celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage. That means that we have a lot of opportunities to look at what the world was like 100 years ago in South Australia when it was anything but fair. To suggest that 100 years ago in South Australia for women&mdash;or for men or for families&mdash;everything was equal and fair and that we have made it worse is an absolute nonsense, just the same as it is a nonsense to talk about equality during the Depression or to say that there was not much trouble during the war years or even during the halcyon years of the 1950s and 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 11 years of Labor government there has been a dramatic improvement in the lot of people in this country, and no widening of the gap. If we spend the time this afternoon, as I suspect we will, with my quoting my sources and Senator Patterson quoting her sources, I do not suppose we will feel any more convinced at the end of the time. But I think it important to put on the record some of this government's achievements and, in particular, to again remind those opposite that none of the calculations of poverty or measurements of inequality calculate in the social wage, which has made such a considerable difference not only to the quality of people's lives but also to how they are able to manage their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, let me say that there has been great growth in jobs in this government's time. There are now two million more jobs; a 26 per cent increase in employment. I am very heartened by the figures we have heard today which suggest&mdash;in fact they do not suggest; they actually make quite clear&mdash;that the recovery in the economy is now being seen in jobs and in the falling number of people relying on pension benefits. Evidence relating to newstart allowances is that those payments have fallen by 25,000 in the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also established a wages system with an award safety net, and social security payments have dramatically increased during the life of this government. The base pension rate is up 15 per cent relative to the CPI. If we include rent assistance, particularly for those people who are able to be assisted in that way, the increase is from 106 per cent to 113 per cent of the so-called Henderson poverty line. Sole parent pensioners with two children, renting privately, have had a 37 per cent increase in real terms, from 91 per cent to 103 per cent above the poverty line. Family payments for low income families are up by 50 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on the age and the number of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson has not mentioned these factors. Of course, they do not fit easily with the thesis that she is running this afternoon. It is important to note what I said in question time today and what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has often said&mdash;that what our Working Nation white paper is about is making absolutely sure that our commitment is to every Australian having a decent and reasonable way of life. That is what our social security payments are about. In the past people eked out a very miserable existence or had no access to social security at all.

That is why we have the white paper, the commitment to people who are unemployed, the jobs compact payments and so on. We are committed to having a truthful analysis of these arrangements. Senator Patterson is saying that there is a gap. For a number of reasons, I am saying that there is no gap. One reason is that a lot of the things like the social wage are not counted in the equation; another is that what I would call very reasonable and honourable critics conclude quite differently. Mr Whiteford also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many critics considered only part of what has happened over that period since 1983 . . . It is the partial nature of such analysis that leads to misleading conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that Senator Patterson and I would probably much rather try to tackle these problems based on accurate conclusions rather than misleading ones. Perhaps the most comprehensive work in this area has been carried out by Travers and Richardson, published last year in their book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living Decently</EMPHASIS>. I will quote one of the things they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed `living decently'. Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was not the world-leader in equality, but it still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world. Australia is a world-leader when it comes to social mobility; that is, both privilege and disadvantage are less likely to be inherited in Australia than in any other country. There is disadvantage, of course, but one of our more positive findings is that disadvantage in one aspect of life is often offset by advantages elsewhere. Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the `gloom and doom' that is typical of many editorial writers and political and social commentators.</PARA>
<PARA>I will move on to some figures about the so-called comments attributed to Ann Harding and the claim that her papers purport to show that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. These figures are a gross exaggeration. Indeed, Professor Harding herself suggests that her work should be used in analysing the distribution of poverty, not its total level. Her analysis uses the so-called Henderson poverty line&mdash;an arbitrary line based on the 1966 basic wage, adjusted for family composition according to a study conducted in New York in 1954. By fairly common agreement, it is no longer a reliable baseline which, by the way, has increased by 16 per cent over the last decade as a result of increasing household disposable incomes, partly as a result of rising labour force participation by women. This means that this poverty measure has the perverse result that rising affluence in the 1980s actually increased poverty. So I do not believe we can settle for those kinds of conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An earlier study by Harding which used actual social security payments suggested that there may be as few as zero sole parents in poverty. We have to appreciate that these studies do not include all of the same data, nor do they compare apples with apples or pears with pears. It is difficult to make any reasonable conclusion on studies that are not using the same data, not analysing all of it in the same way or, in fact, including much of the social wage data anyhow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with this study is that it ignores assets. A business person, for example a farmer, with substantial assets but having one bad year is counted as poor or a family which has deliberately taken on a large mortgage in order to buy a large house may be counted as poor. Members of the opposition quoted an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>&mdash;from my reading of what happens in the other place, they often quote from this publication. That article purports to compare inequality across countries but it uses completely different data from country to country. For some countries it uses tax data; for Australia it uses income distribution survey data which undercounts over $3 billion in social security and welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful here. We have to know what the opposition would do about these questions.

Pension rates, when measured against the CPI, have increased by 15 per cent under this Labor government but fell by two per cent under the Fraser government. The evidence shows that countries that have experienced the greatest increase in inequality are those countries that have implemented the sorts of labour market policies proposed by the opposition. One example of this is the United Kingdom. The opposition wanted to slash $10 billion off the social wage at the time of last year's election&mdash;and it still tells us it wants to slash the deficit.

<PARA>Mr Howard's policy of splitting incomes to help families contradicts his words of praise for the Labor government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1987, the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, coined that now infamous quote&mdash;some say epitaph&mdash;`By 1990, no Australian child will live in poverty.' In 1994, the Year of the Family, nearly 20 per cent of Australia's children live in a family with no breadwinner. Only three short years after that ill-fated date in 1987, and some 11 years under the Labor government, Australia is no closer to solving the problem of inequality and poverty. In fact, studies show that during the past decade, poverty and inequality have risen dramatically. Poverty, Adam Smith wrote, is `not having enough to live without shame in your own community'. In communities around this country it seems that more and more Australians are forced to live in shame.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 30 years Australia has gone from being the most egalitarian nation in the world to one of the most unequal. According to a recent world competitiveness report, out of 18 similar industrialised nations, Australia ranked as the least equitable nation as far as wealth distribution was concerned. In addition, Australia has the dubious honour of having one of the highest levels of affluence coupled with one of the highest levels of poverty in the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, Australians have always considered themselves to be part of an egalitarian society, a homogeneous middle-class society free from the vast disparities of wealth evident in other nations. Yet this perception of a middle-class society is nothing more than a myth, a vestige of the 1950s and 1960s ethos when the middle-class was a growing sector in our society. In the 1990s we are a much more polarised society. Australia's middle class is shrinking while both ends of the economic spectrum are growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today, the wealthiest one per cent control around 25 per cent of the nation's wealth while the top 10 per cent control around 60 per cent. This contrasts dramatically with the poorest 40 per cent of people in the country who, only a decade ago, controlled 22 per cent of the nation's wealth; whereas today they control little more than nine per cent. So it is fatuous to say that this change has not occurred in this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have today is a case of the poor getting poorer and a striking display of the rich getting richer. The poorer members of our society are becoming even more powerless over their future. In contrast to these growing sectors in society, Australia's middle-class&mdash;the perceived mainstay of Australia's society&mdash;is an endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the problems of the long-term unemployed and the elderly constantly surround us, attention must now be directed to a new class of Australians, a class equally powerless and some say even more disenfranchised from the power base than the two I have just mentioned. We are now witnessing the emergence of the working poor. These are young Australians in full-time, low-skilled jobs, taking home low wages, with some wages just above the poverty line. These are the people who are trying to build a home, raise a family and keep some hope&mdash;yet this hope is fading fast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These hardworking young Australians now constitute almost 10 per cent of the bottom income earners in this country. They are the forgotten poor. These are the working poor. These are the single income families who are battling to stay off the social security system, battling to maintain the self-esteem that having a job represents. Yet, because of both government intervention and inaction, these battlers are almost destined to join the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen, having a job does not restrict people from the poverty trap. For the low wage earner, benefits, like those provided by the state to the elderly and the unemployed, are scarce. In fact, studies show these working poor are the most affected by the inequalities in wealth distribution. So by just looking at income levels we may get a distorted picture of the poverty levels and wealth distribution. In measuring wealth transfer levels in Australia we need to draw comparisons between those at different stages of the life cycle and different levels of the work force and assess just how the scarce public funds are to be distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In measuring poverty we must also look at needs. The needs of those struggling with unemployment are well documented, but the needs of those struggling with employment are not so apparent. If we are to effectively reduce poverty in this country, we must not limit ourselves to those without work. Our efforts must include bolstering the vulnerable at the lower end of the income scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the declining importance of such institutions as the church, the extended family, the local neighbourhood and community, we are looking somewhat blindly towards the state to provide the services that these failing institutions once maintained. We are now heavily dependent on the public sector to provide a large proportion of our needs. There are 8,116,000 people receiving benefits from government&mdash;read taxpayers&mdash;in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures highlight the growing level of government involvement in the economy and society. The state is quickly assuming many of the traditional roles performed by the family and institutions, yet its use of budget deficits to pay its way is self-defeating. The problem with borrowing today is that we will burden our children with the debt of tomorrow. It is the next generation that will have to pay for our failures today. As leading industrialist John Ralph said last year, `We have mortgaged the future of our children.' We are ignoring the issue of intergenerational equity and allowing the future of this country to rest in the hands of foreign banks and financial institutions. It seems ironic that, at a time when we are striving for greater autonomy and independence as a nation, we are quickly chaining ourselves to be servants to foreign lenders. The shackles of this debt may not be released for many decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest arguments for the redistribution of wealth is founded in the area of health. Health is too often treated like economics. People are encouraged to think that the size of the cake is more important than how it is shared. This argument is particularly sensitive in the area of health and inequality. There is a stronger belief that a nation's health and living standards are positively correlated, but such beliefs can be misleading. The constant rhetoric about rises in GDP gives little comfort to the ailing in our society. In fact, it is estimated that between only 10 and 25 per cent of the improvement in life expectancy can be directly attributed to rises in living standards. Thus in health economics the connection between living standards and health standards is tenuous. The real relationship is between income distribution and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When measuring the rise in poverty levels in Australia, our ageing society cannot be ignored. With the number of retired people growing by over 10 per cent each year, the level of income inequality in Australia is directly linked to the growing number of pensioners, with more and more people leaving the work force and retiring on the old age pension. The effects of this on the social welfare system, the health system and the work force are evident. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a short contribution on this matter of public importance. I will start by saying Senator Herron raised a number of important issues in this debate&mdash;issues that go to the question about how we measure poverty and inequality in Australian society. Senator Herron, in making some of his points, highlighted the first point that I wish to make, which is that at this stage we are not able to get a proper measure of wealth and of income distribution in Australian society. That is partly due to some of the issues that Senator Herron raised about the changes that are occurring in Australian society&mdash;the different work patterns, the different family living arrangements and a whole range of other issues that mean that references to things like the Henderson poverty line are woefully out of date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This points to the need for a much more reliable analysis of wealth and income distribution in Australian society. All of the measures, such as the ABS income distribution series, fail to address the totality of the picture that one would need to have to make a proper analysis. I question whether there is a widening gap, but it is difficult to come to any conclusive view on that question because there is no proper analysis that takes into consideration all the necessary points, such as those the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, mentioned&mdash;the social wage and in particular Medicare&mdash;and other issues such as the increase in superannuation in the Australian work force and further changes in the taxation area, which will also need to be accounted for in any proper analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already highlighted the change in the bottom marginal rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. The impact of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax on wealth distribution in Australian society also need to be taken into account. With the fringe benefits tax, the cashing out of previously uncounted income will have quite a substantial impact on some of the measures that were traditionally used in assessing these issues. We have to move towards a much better analysis in this area. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has been looking at some work that is being done on social and economic indicators in Australian society so that debate can be much more informed and less dominated by prejudice and politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is poverty in Australian society but I think the record of this government in attacking the causes of that poverty is a good one. The key issue in determining poverty in Australian society is employment. No government has been more committed to creating employment in its economy than the Australian federal government. We realise that the general condition of the economy is the key to that employment growth, but we have also been very conscious of the need to help the long-term unemployed&mdash;those who are most likely to become the long-term poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Working Nation was all about&mdash;ensuring that, as we got economic growth and as we got growth in jobs, we took the long-term unemployed with us. We wanted to ensure that they were not left behind as the economy started to grow again. We are seeing that growth, and we are starting to see growth in the employment figures. It was announced only today that the October unemployment rate was down to 9.1 per cent. I think all senators would welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the key to alleviating poverty in Australian society has very much to do with creating jobs and making sure that people are not unemployed.

There are a number of reasons why the people of the bush have been brought to their knees by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, for many years this government ran a high inflation economy. The farmers who export most of what they produce are subject to the vagaries of international markets. Because they could not pass on the increased costs of production they found that their costs were rising by anything from 10 to 14 per cent every year throughout the 1980s. That helped to precipitate a massive collapse in their terms of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, interest rates soared way above the levels of those of our competitors and have continued to stay there. It should not be forgotten that, for over 18 months, farmers paid interest in excess of 20 per cent per annum. Even now, many farmers are still paying in excess of 14 per cent. While the government bleats about what it is doing to help farmers and the rest of rural Australia, it is still pursuing economic policies that continually push interest rates up for everybody&mdash;not just farmers, but for home buyers as well. With the current account running as it is, and with the deficit increasing, there can be no other result than higher interest rates. The recent one per cent rise in interest rates alone will cost the farm sector approximately $170 million extra in yearly repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government stands condemned because it has allowed the farming community to bear the full brunt of the costs of deregulation. This government has left everyone else insulated from the harsh realities of economic life while it has stripped away virtually every assistance that the farming sector receives. It still costs up to three times more in this country to process a kilogram of meat than it does in America, or twice what it costs in New Zealand or Argentina. These are the nations we are competing against in Asia. Take a look at the shipping industry in this country. It is still disappointingly ineffectual after the now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, was put in charge of reforming the waterfront. That process cost taxpayers nearly $400 million. I do not think we got value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the government is culpable because it has gutted the income equalisation deposits scheme&mdash;the prudent farmers' drought insurance&mdash;just when it was needed most. It has burdened isolated employers with the fringe benefits tax. It has pushed fuel prices unnecessarily high by using fuel excise as a way of raising nearly $10 billion per annum, of which only $870 million is returned to the national roads program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of rural and regional Australia is the sharp increase in suicide and marriage breakdowns suffered by families due to the intolerable pressures often caused by their debt and their poverty. Thanks to this government, country Australia will never be the same again. Rural and regional Australia have been disgracefully neglected and mismanaged. This neglect is reflected in our massive debt and balance of payments crises. Each and every Australian has suffered, or will suffer, from this government's apathy towards rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not really surprising that two-thirds of the 1.8 million Australians living in poverty are families with dependent children. Firstly, the income tax system no longer recognises the number of people who live on a given income. Secondly, there has been a stagnation in real incomes over recent years. We heard Minister Cook today almost boasting that wage levels have been kept down and that the income from that area has been kept down to point something per cent. Thirdly, both the federal and state governments have increasingly resorted to increased indirect taxes which bear more heavily on families, especially larger families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, governments are moving towards either increased charges for basic facilities, such as water, or are levying disguised taxes on consumers of basic utility services through forced dividend requirements on public utilities. Fifthly, because family payments were inadequately indexed, their real value is less than what it was in 1979 when family allowance was introduced in place of tax rebates and child endowment. I have talked about this before and I do not want to go into that further today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with these unfavourable trends, there has been a predictable but sad economic and demographic response. Fewer people are choosing to have children, and many are having fewer than they would otherwise prefer. Couples are hanging on to living standards by both seeking paid jobs and avoiding, in many cases, having dependent children. Fewer and fewer families can now exist on one income, and that is devastating. Much of the demand for child care for children of mothers in the paid work force is really generated by necessity, and not choice. One of the big demands that is not fulfilled is for infant places in child-care centres. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Baby places. That is distressing. Surveys have shown that mothers of those very young children would rather not be forced into the situation of putting their babies into child-care centres. Many families actually need two incomes to survive. The entry of so many mothers with those young children into the paid work force is not a sign of prosperity but of relative poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should come clean and stop pretending that its child-care policies have anything to do with the welfare of families, children or women. The reality is that the government wants to force women and mothers with dependent children out of the home and into the paid labour market. I have been working for many years, and still am, for the cause of women in the paid work force. I am proud to do so. I am proud of our record in that case. But we have to look at the question of choice, and what occurs when we do not have that choice and the effect of that not only on the people concerned, but also on others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is not the government's intention to try to force mothers into the paid work force, why else would it discriminate so harshly in financial terms against those mothers who wish to care for their own children and not compete for scarce jobs. Indeed, the government has implicitly admitted that its policies are not directed towards free choice. Have honourable senators heard that? The government has admitted it. On page 12 of Australia's national report on population at the recent Cairo conference on population development, the government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the aging of the population is likely to result in greater demands on health and medical services and other support systems for the aged. It also poses particular challenges for the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA>The government goes on to state that one of its responses has been to foster an increase in the size of the labour force through encouraging the increased participation of women. So there we have it&mdash;admissions in the International Year of the Family that the government sees mothers with young dependent children as just another pool of tax slaves. Forget choice; forget what is good for children or for their parents; forget what they want; Treasury needs and must have its taxes. That is what a lot of this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to be passing unnoticed, however, by both the government and most economic commentators is that the government's policy is not even economically rational. The more mothers are forced into the paid work force by the declining real wages of their husbands&mdash;or vice versa&mdash;and increased tax burdens and charges to take up paid employment, the less able they are to have the children they might otherwise want. The more mothers or fathers are forced into the labour market when they would prefer not to be there, the higher the participation rate and the more difficult it is to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasurer Willis has admitted this. At the press club luncheon on 11 May 1994, after the budget, he admitted that increases in the number of married women with children seeking to join the paid work force made `the job of getting unemployment down very, very difficult'. They are his words, not mine. He might have added that taxing people out of being able to afford the number of children they would otherwise want is also another very good way of adding to the Treasury's problems with an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reap what we sow. The shocking statistic that one in 10 families with children has both parents unemployed is a logical result of an economic system which has been designed to force labour force participation by both parents. Surveys by the Institute of Family Studies have shown that many mothers want genuine choice. Why does the government not give them genuine choice? They and their husbands value direct parental input in bringing up healthy, well-adjusted children. They are being told by the government that they are second-rate citizens and that, unless they are clocking a nine-to-five workday on top of their obligations, they are somehow slack halfwits. This is not equality, this is not fairness to families, it is slavery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the very few minutes available to speak on this report, I should like to briefly point out to the Senate and, of course, to the taxpayers of Australia the situation we are facing with road funding. It might be all very well for Mr Brereton to put out a glossy report like this on what has happened in land transport in Australia in the last 12 months&mdash;and worthwhile programs have been carried out or even completed in the last 12 months&mdash;but unfortunately road funding in real terms is dropping and dropping and dropping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that we spend on roads not quite 7c a litre from the fuel excise gathered by this government. At the last count, the fuel excise is about 32c and, of course, will rise again under indexation twice a year. That excise escalates without anyone knowing&mdash;it just turns up at the bowser on the appointed day; and the government does not really get the flack it would get if a bill went through each time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of that 32c or thereabouts, give or take a few decimal points, just under 7c is going back on roads. It is certainly far short of what should be going back to maintain roads at a standard expected in a country of this size, where there are massive road distances and massive rail distances&mdash;after all, this report covers rail as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that at the last count the National Rail Corporation's network is not as up-to-date as we were given to believe in the Working Nation package. I do not know quite how long ago that was, Mr Acting Deputy President; you might be able to fill me in on that&mdash;but it is a while ago now. Whatever was supposed to have been spent on rail in that time, to my knowledge, has not led to the completion of that network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did have one good measure from one of the programs some time ago when, I think, Mr Brown, who was Minister for Land Transport at the time, put in place the black spot program. I criticised it at the time as a vote catching exercise in places where the government had marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am happy to admit that I was wrong in that criticism because, under Mr Brown, that plan worked successfully. The program having worked successfully by fixing a lot of the black spots that existed around Australia, I thought the government would have kept that program up and picked out priority areas where the highest number of accidents occurred and concentrated on those, as well as on the other areas on which road spending should have occurred along the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those black spots on which work has been done, the engineering has been well done and the works have been carried out to make them safer. I can point to a particular spot in Western Australia where, unfortunately, a son of a good friend of mine was killed last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for him, that particular road was rectified under the black spot program only a matter of months after the accident, and now one would have to be blind to get into a bad situation there. It is not too late for the government to look at getting this program on track again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outside of that, this government must increase spending, because in real terms what has been allocated to roads is far below in real terms that spent by the Fraser government in its last year in office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to make some remarks on the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services, following those made by my colleague Senator Kemp, the shadow minister for administrative services. One of the matters which has concerned me over the past year is, of course, the way in which the Department of Administrative Services runs its property operations, particularly in relation to the Casselden Place building in Melbourne. On the last day of the previous sitting week a report by the Auditor-General into the Casselden Place building revealed that there had been significant financial incentives offered to DAS businesses within that building which, of course, is also owned by a DAS business and, ultimately, by the Australian taxpayer. That report revealed that the department has lost, on its own valuation by the Australian Valuation Office, no less than $103 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Walker QC, has said in a press release that that is only a paper loss. He compared it with losses made by the private sector in other buildings in Melbourne. Of course, his defence of that loss of $103 million of taxpayers' money entirely ignores the fact that no other landlord in Melbourne&mdash;and he referred to a number of landlords who have lost money on property deals in Melbourne during Mr Keating's recession&mdash;had the benefit of captive tenants who were not only forced to go into the building by the lessor, that is, the Commonwealth Keating government, but also were captives in relation to the terms and conditions of the rentals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial point to make here is that in the government's handling of the Casselden Place cover-up, it initially sought to refuse to table documents relating to the leases in Casselden Place. I refer specifically to what occurred on 5 May 1994 when Senator McMullan said in the Senate, `There were no particular incentive packages involved in these deals.' Senator McMullan actually misled the Senate. Mr Walker not only misled the Senate by having a letter tabled which stated there were no incentives involved; he also repeated that in his press release of 20 October in which he said, `There were no incentives involved in these deals.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that day, 20 October, Mr Walker tabled two letters, both from the Australian Property Group and both addressed to the DAS business units that lease these buildings. He said in his press release&mdash;and he probably hoped that no journalist actually read the letters&mdash;that they proved conclusively that there were no incentives involved, so he had not misled the parliament. The sad thing is that at least I read the letters, and the letters specifically describe the incentive packages offered to all the individual DAS business units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These incentives were offered to business units such as the Australian Archives. In a letter dated April 1993 there is specific mention of incentives, including a free fit-out and rent free periods to Support Services; Asset Services&mdash;contribution towards fit-out, rent free period; DAS Interiors&mdash;free rent, contribution towards fitting-out costs; and Project Services was given the same incentives. All of these businesses were offered incentives. They were used as inducements to ensure that these groups entered into leases with the Commonwealth. Those leases have yet to be signed. So they are incentives; they are inducements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that both Senator McMullan and Mr Walker have misled this parliament and the people of Australia in their attempts to cover up a $103 million scandal.

If that explanation is not satisfactory, those ministers should certainly be called on to resign.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The site was chosen by the council of the museum and has been reaffirmed a number of times, after extensive examination. I think initially 12 sites in the ACT were looked at to see which of them was the best site for the museum to incorporate this theme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Yarramundi site is agreed by everybody, except the Prime Minister, as the perfect site for the museum. There are a lot of Australians who know and understand why the collection is kept. There are over 200,000 items already in the Museum of Australia collection, most of which presumably will be dispersed or got rid of, in spite of people having given them because they, too, believe in the museum being the history of this country. I quote from page 1 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The museum is making its collection relevant and accessible to as many Australians as possible&mdash;through travelling exhibitions, new communications technology, joint projects and other outreach activities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth going back to the ALP cultural policy of 1993. I do not have time to read all of it, but I will read this portion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concurrently, over the next four years, there will be a staged development of the Museum's site at Yarramundi including exhibition, education and conservation facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>To celebrate that, there was a big publicity photo opportunity event at the site. This was leading up to the 1993 election campaign. There was much celebration about the jobs for Canberra and what it would all mean to the country. The museum was going ahead; $26 million was promised in the next budget for it.

But I suppose there are some reasons that do suggest themselves. This is a Prime Minister who wants to abandon our flag and wants to abandon our constitution. He has no respect for our past.

In other words, there is something far more sinister, it seems to me, in this general rejection of our heritage than simply in some sort of view that the particular heritage the Prime Minister comes from, an Irish one, should be one that predominates and should destroy, say, the Anglo-Saxon traditions or any of the other traditions that exist in Australia. </PARA>

I must say I think it is in very close association with the negative approach to the Australian flag, the national flag, which in one form or another has been with us since Federation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate and I thank the parliamentary secretary. The Australian Sports Drug Agency report clearly demonstrates that Australian professional boxing has got to smarten up its act. It has to clean up its act. We have a situation, as is evidenced on page 114 of this report, of two failures to comply in boxing&mdash;in other words, people refusing to take a drug test. When that happens in other amateur sports we find that sanctions are applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in athletics on 30 July 1993, there was a failure to comply with a drug test and the athlete was suspended for four years. In powerlifting on 16 August 1993 there was a failure to comply and the athlete was suspended for three years. But what do we find when we go to boxing? Failure to comply, no sanctions, because the people involved were professional boxers. I do not know what professional boxing thinks is the right thing, but apparently if you are a professional boxer you can be up to the eyeballs in dope and still be allowed to participate in that profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of professional sports not abiding by the rules. Look at rugby league. Rugby league accepts the proper and reasonable role and, in fact, hires the Australian Sports Drug Agency to ensure that the sport is clean. There has even been testing for cannabis, which one could hardly regard as a performance enhancing drug, in rugby league. There have been cautions for inadvertent use of stimulants and also anabolic steroid tests&mdash;in fact, there was a ten-week suspension for one rugby league player. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem totally inadequate that professional boxing does not end up with sanctions against those people who have been found by the Australian Sports Drug Agency to have failed to comply with its tests. We have not seen a situation where there is a positive test in boxing, presumably because there must be some sort of instruction around the professional boxing business that says, `Look, don't get tested, just refuse, because there are no sanctions and it doesn't matter anyway.' That is totally unacceptable. I do not know what should be done about it but it seems to me that there should be the capacity for firmer action to be taken. One would hope that whoever runs professional boxing in Australia&mdash;in fact, in the world&mdash;should do something about this sort of ludicrous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some problems that strike me from the tables on pages 113 and 114 when the Australian Sports Drug Agency has not yet been advised of positive tests that took place up to a year ago. It is very important not only that these tests should be taken but that there should be appropriate follow-up action, and that the Sports Drug Agency should be advised of what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are couple of other matters that I want to raise. One is that the report reveals that in May 1994 a review of the cost of drug testing services was initiated, and Price Waterhouse has been engaged to develop a costing model and provide advice on the full cost of the drug testing service. These results should be available in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate would be aware, the coalition has long taken the view that there should be a great deal of cost recovery in this area, and I hope this Price Waterhouse report leads to this. I would also like to stress that the agency maintains its emphasis on out-of-competition testing by allocating 56 per cent of tests to this purpose. That is a very sensible approach, and I think we lead the world on that. Over 2,220 elite national level athletes identified by their national sporting organisations were exposed to year-round testing throughout this program. In other words, it is not good enough just to test people in competition, we have to do out-of-competition testing to see whether they are trying to build themselves up illegally and improperly away from the testing area. It is a very effective operation, because the threat of testing is very effective. </PARA>

Now that we are working towards that bilateral arrangement, it will give an opportunity for testing. There is very little testing presently done in China and it will give the Australian officials an opportunity to test, as I understand it, both in contests and outside the period of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does concern me is that there has still been no success by any nation in the world to enter into a meaningful arrangement with the American amateur athletic track and field organisation&mdash;its proper name escapes me but it is the American amateur track and field body&mdash;which refuses to enter into bilateral or multilateral arrangements with other countries which allows for testing of the American amateur athletes. The reason for that is that so many of them are taking drugs and cheating against the rest of the world, and the Americans are concerned not to have their cheats exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that the United States Olympic Committee is prepared to enter into some sort of arrangement. But, ultimately, it does not have the capacity to clean up drugs in sport in America. That is something for the track and field body. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Baume, a former shadow minister for sport, and Senator Crichton-Browne, a very active deputy chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. That committee brought down the landmark report on drugs in sport which led to the foundation of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, ASDA, now chaired by Professor Peter Baume and headed by Steve Haines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of ASDA is very important. It is fair to say that when the agency was established it had what could only be regarded as a very large and enormously important task ahead of it. That task was to bring into existence a regime that would control the use of performance enhancing drugs&mdash;which, in many cases, can severely hurt the wellbeing of those who use them&mdash;thereby making competition in Australian sport, and international sport where possible, fairer. People who choose to use performance enhancing drugs against the rules of competition should not be able to achieve an unfair advantage over athletes who choose to compete without using performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the dilemmas facing Australia in our fight against the abuse of drugs is, as Senator Crichton-Browne said, that it is all well and good testing during competition, but unless random testing is done outside major competition as well, abuses can and will continue and the regime will not be fair. ASDA is to be commended for the initiatives that it has taken in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many of the athletes that I have spoken to in my short time as the shadow minister for sport are vitally interested in the fairness of international competition. A recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> or some other current affairs program highlighted the problem encountered by so many Australian athletes who compete internationally. They live by our rules under a strict drug detection regime but they have to compete against international athletes who abuse performance enhancing drugs. It is crucial in the years leading to the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000 that ASDA remains in the forefront when it comes to entering into negotiations and agreements with nations that still have problems. That way, come the Olympics, Australian athletes will not be at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ensure that the Sydney Olympics are a clean Olympics and that overseas competitors have no advantage through the abuse of performance enhancing drugs. Of course, that will be an enormously difficult thing to achieve. Among the nations of the world there are different levels of enforcement. In some there is very little enforcement and little motivation, incentive or intent to introduce appropriate regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dilemma was highlighted by Lisa Curry-Kenny. Talking hypothetically, she said that if she came 11th, 12th or 13th in an international swimming race against the sort of competition that we have seen in recent months, she would still regard that as a great achievement. She said that if she knew that the 12 people who beat her were all on performance enhancing drugs, she would know in her own mind that she had won because she had played fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say from my own experience in international sporting competition that it is not a lot of fun coming second or third, knowing the person in front has been cheating. Australian athletes have to sacrifice so much for athletic excellence. When they compete internationally and are the best on the day&mdash;they have done the preparation and training, they have made the sacrifices in terms of income, family and home life to be able to travel and compete internationally&mdash;it is not fair if they are denied a gold medal or a world championship or whatever because they are beaten by a drug-enhanced performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the challenge for ASDA. We, as parliamentarians, and all Australians should be proud of ASDA as being a very successful Commonwealth agency. As someone who has criticised quangos from time to time, I am pleased to say that this is one that is working effectively. I commend its annual report and wish it well for the forthcoming year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the government response to the report on video and computer games and classification issues by the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies. I am pleased that the minister responsible, the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, has responded positively to most of the committee's recommendations. I will come back to some of the crucial issues raised by the committee, and which the Attorney-General detailed in the government response, about regulating X- and R-rated computer games in Australia. Firstly, I would like to give the Senate some background to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of new technology in computer games saw promoters developing violent and sexually explicit material in a new format. The absence of any regulation by the government when the technology first came to Australia created a new gateway for X and R type material that states and territories needed to close. State attorneys-general became alarmed by the access of youth to this material, particularly after a lot of strong parental and community concern. This was stated to all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards became involved and after representations from similar groups, it decided to undertake a full inquiry into this matter. People should really understand that the material in this new type of technology which is driven by CD-ROM is very different from videos and films. It is far more graphic and intensive. It is very repetitive in nature and the material can be interactive. The impact on young minds is dramatically greater than the impact just from videos. The difference between videos and this material is as great as the difference between sound and video. The quantum leap in the effect is that great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The psychological impact, particularly on young minds or disturbed minds, can be very great. It is believed that there can be long-term effects on users. Overseas evidence seems to demonstrate that 17 per cent of minors gain access to this material as the technology spreads in other countries. The committee was so concerned that it undertook a series of hearings across Australia. We took evidence from child psychologists, educationalists and people in the medical profession. Most importantly, we also took evidence from people out in the community&mdash;parents and children. We had one very dramatic day here in the parliament when we brought in children from a local high school to tell us about the way they use these sorts of games and materials. It was a very eye-opening session when we heard from the young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After these hearings we recommended that no R or X material would be allowed in computer games. What was needed, we felt, was a very strong regulatory regime to control this material across Australia to protect youth. The Senate report pressured the state and territory attorneys-general to rethink the need to bring in further regulations in their jurisdictions. We stressed at the time the need for full cooperation in our federal system to close this gate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, in late 1993, one state, the ACT and the Northern Territory would not go along with this recommendation. Terry Connolly, the Attorney-General in the ACT, in particular was holding out strongly, wanting the R and X classifications to be allowed in this state. The great worry with that, even though the ACT is only a very small area, is that it would create a gateway like the one we currently have with X-rated videos through to the rest of Australia. The worry was that by mail order and computer modem transfer, this new material would also spread to the children of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information superhighway which is now developing would be a great conduit for carrying a lot of this material. It does not necessarily have to go through the mail. In the Northern Territory, our committee had heard evidence of the terrible impact on the Aboriginal community of the less graphic R and X video technology. The committee heard evidence that this material was causing social chaos with Aboriginal families. One suspects that this was the major reason why the Northern Territory then joined with the other six states in agreeing to stop R and X video games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state, Northern Territory and federal censorship ministers agreed to act to ban R and X classifications for computer games. In April this year the Governor-General signed the ACT ordinance allowing the X and R classifications. This was a crisis point as the gateway to distributing the material to Australian children was now open, irrespective of all other governments' proper actions. It could all come in through the ACTU&mdash;I mean the ACT. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. It could come in through the ACT because of the ordinance the Governor-General had signed. This situation, I believe, made the federal government rethink and act to close this loophole. The minister, Mr Lavarch, gave an undertaking to amend the ACT ordinance to make the ACT conform to the national standard. Ministerial cooperation from the Northern Territory and the states was a high point in action to protect our youth. I thought that when the ACT was forced to join, that was an excellent demonstration of cooperative federalism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, who even took on Terry Connolly in debate on radio over this matter. His argument, particularly about parental concern, was one of the things that finally determined the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue raises considerable concern about the whole area of classification. It points to a number of problems with the national classification code. On the one hand, this code says that adults should read, see and hear what they want. On the other hand, the same code says that minors should be protected from material that is likely to harm and disturb them. Those two principles clash constantly in the area of this video game material in this time of very rapidly changing technology. To the minister's credit, he has supported most of our recommendations in this area to bring the sale and distribution of this material under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 2 says that ministers need to enforce measures with strong penalties and prosecution as a realistic deterrent. Mr Lavarch must emphasise this to his ministerial colleagues in the states and territories, because they are the people who have the power to enforce penalties. Recommendation 4 says that parents will not able to stop children viewing material if the gateways are open. We were pleased that the minister saw the weight of this argument. Recommendation 5 says that there is a need for an MA classification for video and computer games to protect children 15 years and under from unsuitable material. The minister says that some states and territories will not have this MA rating, allowing access to games for people under the age of 15. This loophole will be closed very soon because the parliament now has before it new uniform Commonwealth legislation, the Classification (Publications, Film and Computer Games) Bill which will solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 11 says that the length of tenure of censorship board members needs review. Unfortunately, the government has ignored this recommendation. The committee during the hearings became greatly concerned about the way the office of film and literature classification operated. We believe a lot of the problem comes back to the way the board is staffed. People are there for a very long time. A number of them are ideologically driven. They are desensitised and there is no proper community input. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not an outrageous suggestion. I refer Senator Schacht to the annual report which lists the people who are part of that board. Virtually all of them are either lecturers in journalism or are journalists. The chief censor keeps telling us that it is a representative cross-section of the community, but it is not. It is a number of trendy journalists who have a particular ideological view&mdash;and it is driving censorship in this case. We have made a number of very sensible recommendations including that the chief censor becomes the chief executive officer. We believe that the government would be wise to follow this recommendation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the committee that put this report together, it was unfortunate that I could not speak the last time it was presented. I have had to wait this long to say a few words about the matter. The report that was put together was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the public interest</EMPHASIS>. In the seven years I have been in this parliament and considering the number of committee reports I have been involved with&mdash;they have been numerous, as they are for every senator in this place&mdash;I have to say this is probably the most involved report that I have been associated with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the main reason for that is the huge amount of personal evidence we were given. We heard a whole litany of evidence from people who felt betrayed, who had sought justice, are still seeking justice and have not received the justice they should have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motivation for becoming a part of this committee&mdash;and I believe every other member of the committee had similar motivation&mdash;was the number of people who approached me on a personal basis about injustices they believed had been forced upon them, whether they be in the Public Service, the police force, the bureaucracy or private enterprise. I know that one of the reasons why the chairman, Senator Newman, brought this matter forward was a case involving a person in Tasmania who, I am pleased to say, has received some sort of justice since this report was brought down. He has received a financial payment from the bank that he was having problems with. That all appears in the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an easy job converting all of the evidence into a readable report. I congratulate at the outset Elton Humphery, Yvonne Marsh, Sue Irvine, Angela Stanley and Winifred Jurcevic for their excellent work in putting together this report in such a professional manner, and also my fellow members of the committee&mdash;from all areas of the political sphere&mdash;who put together a unanimous report with, I believe, very significant recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were most impressed with the genuine evidence that was given to us throughout the inquiry. Whilst I will later touch on some of the personal things that I remember so well about this report, I would like now to touch on the major recommendations. They fell into three categories. We felt, first, that it was very important to change the attitude of people towards whistleblowers and the public interest benefits that proceed therefrom. It was very easy to get the impression during the hearings that people can easily be tagged as dobbers. I suppose most Australians do not like a dobber. In the cases of the people we spoke to, they were genuinely concerned not only about their jobs but about the organisations they worked for. They were mostly concerned that no action had been taken in lots of cases and in other cases they had been victimised and shunned for trying to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we felt that the procedures that currently exist fall very short of the mark. The internal systems and reporting systems that should exist within organisations, whether they be in the private sector or the public sector, were just not good enough to deal with the cases of maladministration or corruption that people were finding in the system. In estimates committees and as part of our parliamentary duties we get evidence all the time of waste, of mismanagement and of fraud. It is most important that people be encouraged to report those matters so that not only can justice be done but also the government can save what would run into many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important recommendation we made was the recommendation for the creation of an independent public interest disclosures agency and a board to undertake and oversee that agency. One of the concerns we had was that a lot of the people who came before us had been through the system as it exists. They had been to merit protection and review agencies, the ombudsman and all sorts of people. Initially, these people went straight to their immediate boss. One of the things that came to my attention and impressed me was that, in these long drawn-out cases, the initial report that was done on a particular public servant, or whoever, almost became the benchmark. If people looked at a case further down the track or went for justice somewhere else, whoever was investigating that&mdash;whether it was the ombudsman or whoever&mdash;always went back to the first report that was made by the superior officer or the manager of the person making the complaint, and there was a mind-set. No matter what happened, that initial report&mdash;no matter how good or how bad it was&mdash;became the standard for what followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is why it is most important that we have an independent agency to which a person who feels he has not received justice by going through the normal process can go and know and trust in the people he is dealing with. The board we recommended would consist of nominees from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, the Privacy Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, the Merit Protection and Review Agency, a recognised whistleblower support group, a public interest advocacy centre, an ethics group, a trade union and other national community organisations. There would also be a parliamentary involvement, with the appointment of a senator and member of the House of Representatives. I believe we would have a totally independent and well-intentioned board and agency that could handle the huge amounts of requests which are coming from people within the Public Service and private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were somewhat critical of one or two cases, particularly in Queensland. I will not go into any great detail about those particular cases. My colleague Senator Woodley, from Queensland, has touched upon one of the cases involving a person called Kevin Lindeberg. My colleague Senator Parer spoke about the same matter. I know that Senator Chamarette has the same sorts of feelings that I do about this. So we have four senators who, after hearing dozens of witnesses, at the end of the day came down with the same opinion: that Mr Lindeberg was sadly done by. I refer to a press report which appeared in a newspaper in Queensland and in which he had the opportunity to put his point of view. He said that he was still a member of the Labor Party even though he has not received any justice from the Labor Party in the state government in Queensland. We noted in our report our concerns about this particular matter and about unresolved cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CJC looked at the matter. We do not believe the reply it gave us was satisfactory. The issue all revolves around the state minister Ms Warner, the shredding of the Heiner documents and the accusations that the Goss cabinet deliberately misled the state archivist. Senator Woodley has already very eloquently put that matter forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the evidence that was given to us it was harrowing to see witnesses break down. I will never forget one particular case. A professor who was giving evidence to us had, on that very day, been removed from his office because he dared to criticise the vice-chancellor about research in the university and where the money was going. It was not only unusual but very memorable. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the report of the Committee's Inquiry into Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment in Australia which was tabled on 9 June 1994. The report was very timely for the Program as it amassed a large body of information, including statements of view from many influential individuals and groups. This information will be extremely useful in developing policy and planning for the future of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Government response to the report was due within 3 months of tabling. However, many of the issues raised in the report are outside the scope of the Department and we are in the process of consulting widely with other Commonwealth Departments, and the State and Territory Governments to formulate a response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following general comments in response to the report are provided for your information at this stage. On the whole, the report supports the general direction that the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer is taking. The outcome of the Inquiry was strongly supported by the State Program Managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with the States and Territories, undertake a national education campaign promoting the Program. Such a campaign is currently being developed and is due to be launched in February 1995. The campaign will be targeted at both women and General Practitioners and will specifically address some of the issues raised in the report. In addition, a Working Group on the Provision of Consistent Information to Women has been established. The role of this group is to liaise with the States and Territories to develop consistent messages on a variety of issues within the Program. This will ensure that State/ Territory education campaigns and general methods of information provision carry consistent messages across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommended that the supply of radiographers and radiologists be regularly monitored by Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments. This is currently an issue of great importance within the Program and workforce issues remain a standing agenda item of the Commonwealth and State/Territory Managers meetings. The Commonwealth is currently developing a strategy to investigate the problems related to the supply of radiographers and radiologists for the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also recommended that the Program improve access for women in rural and remote areas. Under the funding arrangements for the continuation of the National Program, funding will be provided to better enable the States/Territories to provide services to these women. That component of funding will be calculated at a higher cost per woman screened. The formal offer of this funding to the States/Territories will be made in September. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Advisory Committee has recently endorsed a paper titled Policy and Practice in Relation to Symptomatic Women in the Program. The statements in the paper are consistent with the recommendations in relation to symptomatic women in the report (Recommendations 11 and 12). It is intended that a number of similar policy papers will be written and included in a Manual of National Program Policy Documents. This will also assist in the promotion of consistent information about the Program to various audiences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has not been possible to undertake the level of consultation necessary to prepare an adequate response for tabling by 8 September 1994. It will also not be possible to respond to recommendations 18 and 19 until after the House of Representatives Committee has reported. It is expected that the Government response will be available for tabling by mid-November.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE INTERIM REPORT OF THE JOINT/STANDING COMMITTEE ON ELECTORAL MATTERS ENTITLED `FINANCIAL REPORTING BY POLITICAL PARTIES'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1994 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSC) resolved, pursuant to its more general reference covering the conduct of the 1993 election, to take evidence on the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act). It did so in response to a number of representations on the administrative burdens imposed by the requirement for registered political parties to furnish to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Annual Returns of income and expenditure. This requirement was introduced by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The JSC advertised its inquiry in the national press and in response received nine submissions from individuals, political party organisations and the AEC. Public hearings were conducted on 6 and 7 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Interim Report of the JSC entitled `Financial Reporting by Political Parties' was tabled in Parliament on 30 June 1994 and contained nine recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. That Division 5A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and associated regulations be amended as necessary so that Annual Returns by registered political parties list a total amount of expenditure, rather than individual transactions within that total.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Government remains fully committed to the essential objective of disclosure as expressed in the second reading speech of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 that "electoral financing in Australia should be open and transparent" to minimise the risks of corruption in funding political campaigns. The Government does not believe, however, that this objective is significantly enhanced by the requirement for parties to record and report transactions within set categories as currently set down in the regulations. The Government proposes, therefore, that the requirement for parties to disclose their expenditure under particular categories should be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. In order to maintain the spirit of the current legislation, the Government would wish to retain the requirement that payments to any individual or organisation equal to, or exceeding the threshold of, $1500 be disclosed. It would no longer require parties to disclose the individual transactions within that total. It proposes that the legislation be amended so that only transactions of $500 or more need to be aggregated when determining whether the threshold is reached. These changes would apply to individual party units and therefore substantially lessen the administrative burden placed upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. That section 314AB of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that Annual Returns from registered political parties are required to be lodged within 16 weeks after the end of the relevant financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. This recommendation is welcomed by the Government as it would enable more timely processing of Annual Returns by the Australian Electoral Commission prior to their release for public inspection. The Government realises, however, that the shortened reporting deadline would be a further burden on political parties if the reporting requirements were not streamlined and acknowledges that the shortened period is only practicable in terms of party administration if recommendations 1 and 3 are implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. That the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended as necessary so that $500 is set as the threshold for disclosure of individual amounts received and paid by, on or behalf of political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The Government proposes that the recording and reporting of income received by political parties be simplified. This would be achieved by removing the reporting categories specified in the regulations and the requirement to report certain individual income transactions. It is proposed therefore that only where individual transactions exceed $500 will the particulars of those transactions be required to be recorded by party units. In addition, only where the total of such receipts (i.e. sums exceeding $500) by a party unit from an individual or organisation aggregates to $1500 or more would the source and total of that income then need to be disclosed. The requirement to disclose each individual transaction within those aggregates would be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. These changes would substantially lessen the administrative burden across the party, and particularly on the party agent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. That section 305A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that donors to registered political patties or State branches thereof are not required to lodge a return with the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. While the Government is in favour of simplifying reporting requirements as far as possible, it is of the view that there remains a need for sufficient checks to ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained. The Government sees one means of achieving this as being the maintenance of third party reporting which would enable an appropriate level of verification to be conducted by the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Government does believe, however, that third party reporting should be made consistent with the disclosure requirements of political parties. The Government proposes, therefore, that the legislation be amended to require donors to lodge annual disclosure returns rather than submitting returns following an election. Consistent with this annual reporting requirement, the disclosure threshold would be reduced from $4500 to $1500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. That procedures for AEC compliance audits be amended so that agents of registered political parties are required to be present at local audits, and are responsible for presenting to the AEC such records for audit as are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. There is nothing in the current legislation which prevents State agents or any other party official from being present at local audits, and indeed it has been the practice of the AEC to allow them to attend. The Government acknowledges, however, that the present provisions do not guarantee party agents the right to be present if they so desire. Accordingly, the Government is prepared to amend the legislation to provide party agents with the right to be present but, in order to retain an appropriate degree of flexibility for all involved, it proposes that the agent be given the power to delegate this responsibility or waive the right of attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. That Part XX (Election Funding and Financial Disclosure) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to clearly require disclosure of income received by registered political parties from any trust fund or similar fund or account, where such income is above the disclosable amounts set out in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. The Act already requires the disclosure by political parties of all income received from any trust fund or similar fund or account. The Government proposes that disclosure be extended to include not only the donations made to political parties but also the deposits of capital into such funds and accounts where the fund or account functions substantially for the benefit of a party or parties. The Government does not seek to impose retrospective disclosure in respect of past returns, rather it proposes that if the Party receives any future interest payment from the same fund or from any new fund containing all or part of the original fund then the base source of capital that earned the interest must then be fully disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. The Government also proposes that the legislation be amended to ensure that there is full disclosure of the transactions of all bodies over which a party exercises control or which exist substantially for the benefit of a party or parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. That Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended as necessary to enable parties to designate officers to sign correspondence on behalf of agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. The Government would also aim to ensure that full accountability under the Act is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. That section 294 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that the same amount of public funding is payable for a Senate vote as for a House of Representatives vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. Currently a Senate vote attracts a funding rate equal to one half of the rate payable for a House of Representatives vote where both elections are held simultaneously or three quarters of the funding rate for a House of Representatives vote where the Senate election is held separately. The election funding rates applicable at the 1993 federal election were 100.787 cents for a House of Representatives vote and 50.393 cents of a Senate vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. The Government proposes an increase in the level of public funding for a Senate vote so that it is equal to the funding level for a House of Representatives vote. The level of public funding for both Houses will be increased to $1.50. On the basis of election funding payments made at the 1993 federal election, this proposal would result in a budgetary increase in a joint House of Representatives and half Senate election of around $14.656 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. That Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to provide that political parties registered on a national basis receive public funding for elections directly to their federal or national offices, via national agents. Where political parties registered on a State basis do not notify the AEC that they wish to receive public funding on a national basis, those parties shall continue to receive public funding through their State agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33. To give effect to what it understands to be the intention of this recommendation, the Government proposes to amend the Act to require a party agent making a claim for election funding to provide a statement either nominating a registered political party to which payment is to be made or advising that the claimant party does not wish to make a nomination. Where a nomination has been made the AEC must make the payment to the nominated party. This will enable State/Territory branches of parties to nominate that payment be made to the National Secretariat of the party.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The first report I tabled involves the mid-life upgrading of Blamey Barracks, Kapooka, New South Wales. I would like to acknowledge the fact that Senator Woodley asked me if he could buy one of those mid-life upgrades, and I said that I did not know where he could buy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated cost of $21.5 million. Most of the buildings at Kapooka were constructed in the 1950s and the 1960s and are now in need of refurbishment. Present working and living conditions at Blamey Barracks are below standard, with the rank and file and the recruit kitchen not meeting the building codes of occupational health and safety requirements. A need therefore exists to provide suitable working and living conditions for the recruits and staff stationed at Blamey Barracks, Kapooka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While at Blamey Barracks, Kapooka, the committee was impressed with the green areas around the base. The committee compliments the Department of Defence on reticulated treated effluent from the sewerage treatment facilities being used to irrigate these landscaped areas at Kapooka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearings concern was expressed that local industry would not be given an opportunity to be involved in the project. The Department of Defence has since held meetings with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and assurances were given that the construction manager for the project will not be tendering for construction works at Kapooka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised by the Department of Defence that it intends to conduct a seminar with the building industry in Wagga Wagga to discuss forms of contract and tendering processes. The Department of Defence advised that each package or trade element will be awarded as a result of a competitive tendering process. Local companies should therefore be in a strong position to make competitive bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence continues to have discussions with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and proceeds with the intention of conducting a seminar for the building industry in the near future. The committee has commended the Department of Defence on its willingness to liaise with members of the building industry concerning the proposed works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled involves the stage 2 redevelopment of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The Royal Military College is the premier institution for the training of officers for the Australian Army. It trains men and women in the skills of leadership, tactics, military law and administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee involved the provision of modern and functional facilities to support the training objectives of the college and comprises a new logistics complex and headquarters building, extensions to the gymnasium, officers' mess, military instruction block and the medical centre, and the upgrading of playing fields and ovals, along with adjustments to the existing road network to provide safer and more efficient traffic circulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the work should proceed at an estimated turn-out cost of $28.7 million. A significant element of the proposed works is the construction of a new logistics complex. The committee concluded that the existing complex is housed in inadequate and deficient accommodation and should be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another element is the proposed construction of a new headquarters building. The committee concluded that the proposed location and design of the proposed new headquarter buildings are consistent with the master plan and should be compatible with adjacent buildings. A feature of the redevelopment, which those honourable senators who travel to and from Canberra airport will notice when the work is completed, will be the provision of a new main entrance. This is dictated largely by the ACT government's proposed duplication of Morshead Drive, which was examined by another committee some years ago. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence and the ACT government should discuss coordination of road construction with a view to the work being undertaken concurrently as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with the upgrading of the playing fields, the committee was pleased to discover that the army has a pilot project under way involving the use of grey water to water the playing fields. If the pilot project proves feasible, substantial savings in water and funds will be achieved. The committee has therefore recommended that, if no salinity problems emerge, the use of grey water should be extended to all playing fields at Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy, as well as other defence establishments where practical. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It was my privilege to lead the Australian delegation to Hong Kong and China. There were eight members and senators on the delegation. The very able secretary was Ms Andrea Griffiths, from the Department of the Senate. I think she would be known to all in this chamber. She did an excellent job in looking after our requirements before leaving and while in Hong Kong and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to Hong Kong for four days prior to our visit to China. It was not my first visit to Hong Kong. I was a member of a parliamentary delegation that visited the territory of Hong Kong four years ago. It was interesting to compare some of the changes that have occurred just in that brief four-year period. The major and quite overwhelming issue for the future of Hong Kong is the reversion of sovereignty to China to occur on 1 July 1997. Clearly, that is a major economic and political issue for people who live in the territory of Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we were in Hong Kong, amongst other matters we paid a visit to the legislative council. We met leading members of the LegCo and it is our hope that there can continue to be links between the LegCo and the Australian parliament. We paid a visit to one of the detention centres, where we were able to meet boat people from Vietnam who are held in detention. I find this particularly depressing in the sense that these people are locked up for very long periods&mdash;in some cases, for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 24,000 refugees have been returned to Vietnam in the four years since I was last in Hong Kong. We have recommended that the only durable solution to the asylum seeker problem should be to continue to support the efforts of the Hong Kong government in returning back to Vietnam people who are not fearing for their lives because of political repression in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, a significant number of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong do not arrive by boat. They come over land through China. They are assisted by relatives or friends in southern China. They live under very trying conditions. I certainly think the policy of repatriation will give the signal to those refugees that attempting to enter other countries via Hong Kong is not a feasible proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never been to China. I can recall in 1966, when I visited Hong Kong with my family, looking over the fence from Hong Kong into China. That was at the time of the height of the cultural revolution and people could not visit China. Looking across that same area today, one can see a city of some millions of people. That city has grown up in just the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really hits one in China is the enormous economic changes that are occurring. China is one vast construction site. One cannot help but be impressed by the very significant economic growth, averaging about 12 per cent. That was clearly  evidenced everywhere we went. Generally, the economic growth is widely welcomed by all sections of Chinese society. Of course, that comes at some expense. The pollution of the environment was quite obvious everywhere we went. There was quite severe air and water pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health and safety are issues of major concern, particularly in the workplace. Just before we visited Shanghai there had been a major industrial accident at a building site where a concrete pour had gone wrong and a number of people were killed. There is quite a serious level of accidents at the workplace in China. Interestingly, that issue and the issue of pollution of the environment are matters that are relatively openly discussed by Chinese people and by the official Chinese media. Corruption appears it be a significant problem. That, combined with the other issues, undermines confidence in the economic progress that is quite clearly being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events of Tiananmen Square are certainly remembered by people. The delegation raised the issue of human rights on a number of occasions during the visit. Interestingly, China is not a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and is very actively seeking entry into GATT. The delegation raised a variety of issues, including better access for our semi-processed wool in particular. Various issues relating to access for horticultural products were also raised, including the issue of access for apples from my home state. I am pleased to say that, since returning from China, that has been listed as an issue of priority for consideration for technical assessment for phyto sanitary conditions to allow access for apples into China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the restructuring of the economy, there is a requirement by the Chinese government that a significant number of business enterprises become profitable and, in doing so, many of them are entering into joint ventures with overseas firms. The modernisation that is occurring in a number of areas&mdash;for example, management and capital upgrading&mdash;is again obviously leading to significant economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of interest was the fact that a number of the plants that we visited&mdash;for example, the ACI bottle factory in Shanghai&mdash;were employing the very latest in technology. The Chinese were not simply relying on lower costs&mdash;for example, lower wages&mdash;but they were also relying on the latest technology to ensure not just a significant increase in production but a significant increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was again of interest to consider a bottle factory in Shanghai, amongst the most modern in the world, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. However, the nature of the Chinese economy is such that the distribution system is very basic. In fact the bottles are hand-packed into hessian bags and then hand-loaded onto trucks for distribution within China. It is a very outmoded system of distribution which leads to a significant wastage of bottles through breakage. So one has this contrast between a very new technology, very modern techniques and high production and productivity levels in some areas of the economy, and a very basic distribution system in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Australian business person, Mr Peng&mdash;this has certainly been raised in this Senate and the other place&mdash;has been arrested and held in detention for a significant period of time, between six and nine months. The delegation raised this issue in Hong Kong. Certainly the treatment of Mr Peng does not engender confidence as to the treatment of Australian business people in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are just some of the matters I want to mention. I once again thank Andrea Griffiths, the secretary of the delegation, and my parliamentary colleagues for their cooperation on what was a very worthwhile trip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words to what Senator Sherry, the leader of the parliamentary delegation to China and Hong Kong, has just put on record. I was fortunate enough, with Julia, to be a member of the delegation and, as Senator Sherry said, it was indeed a fascinating experience. I do not wish to go over all the detail again; but in reference to China in particular, I would like to lift out a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry mentioned economic development. Although China is indeed one vast construction site, it has reached rather differential stages of development. On our trip through Shaanxi Province, when we visited a school where the Australian Embassy had provided school books, which in itself was an experience, it was quite apparent that work both in the countryside in agricultural pursuits and in the cities in semi-industrial activities work was still being carried out in a very primitive manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one adds to that the speed of development and the introduction of technology, one cannot help but wonder what the social and employment effects will be. Very clearly, not only thousands but millions of people will become unemployed as technology increases in China. That is one of the major problems that the rulers of China, whoever they may then be, will be faced with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to address the subject of the legal system as it interacts with human rights issues. Over an eight-day period of negotiations with representatives from the department of foreign affairs of the Chinese Republic, I was finally able to get them to accept a list of 222 political prisoners who had been arrested following Tiananmen Square, as well as a list of the 16 Tibetan nuns. I got an undertaking to have these lists processed through the department of justice and through the department of internal security to answer two questions which I posed: firstly, what is the well being of these people at this stage? Secondly, is there any likelihood of an early release? So far, no answer has been received, but I have written to the department again today, coinciding with the tabling of this report, requesting that an answer be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that finally seemed to sway the departmental representatives to pay some attention to the human rights aspect was interesting to me. It was the argument that, if the legal system were being reformed to cope with corporations law, to cope with contract law, to cope with the general opening up of economic affairs with other countries, then people dealing with China or being asked to deal with China could not expect to have any confidence that the laws on corporations and contracts would be observed if the laws on the freedom and safety and security of individual persons were such that people could be, without due process, arrested and held. When in future we put forward human rights issues in our dealings with China, it will perhaps be useful to use that argument. If China wants to deal with us on an even footing as commercial partners, it must also accept the responsibilities of a legal system that guarantees the security of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to Senator Sherry as the leader of the delegation. It is in large measure due to him that the delegation was a success and was received with respect by dignitaries and other people in China. The delegation had the benefit of the services of Ms Andrea Griffiths, the Deputy Black Rod, who made sure in a very difficult environment that all the administrative details, of which there were many, were attended to with superb efficiency and with a cheerful face. The thanks of the delegation are due to both Senator Sherry and Ms Andrea Griffiths. I might add that although the delegation comprised members from across party lines, not only did we manage to survive the 15 or so days in a cooperative and friendly manner but we actually enjoyed each other's company. I will recall that trip with great pleasure in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, one of the major commitments in Working Nation is to ensure that the long-term unemployed get extra assistance to enable them to participate better in the jobs growth. The success of Jobstart in targeting long-term unemployed assistance is reflected in the drop in the number of long-term unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has fallen by 53,000 over the last year and by 73,000 since the last election, that is, out of a total seasonally adjusted job growth in that time of 356,000 people. This is against a backdrop where, during the 1980's, it took seven years and 1.6 million jobs to cut long-term unemployment by 109,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation takes the targeting measures one important step further; it significantly extends case management services and opens those services and their provision up to competition. Experience is that this targeting of intensive one-to-one servicing is very successful in improving the opportunities for long-term unemployed people to obtain jobs. Case management will provide a continuing relationship between a job seeker and a case manager. Together they will develop a personalised package of assistance that will focus on effective job searching and matching to identify job opportunities. Where job search activity fails to result in employment, labour market program assistance will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this legislation is to promote full employment by providing a free employment service and to draw on a diversity of public sector, community and private sector resources, to achieve this goal as cost effectively as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation will improve the quality and effectiveness of employment services through enhanced case management services for the long-term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides the framework for development over time of an open competitive environment for the supply of case management services. A new regulatory body, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA), will be established independently of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). One of its central responsibilities will be to encourage and facilitate contracted case managers to provide case management services in competition with Employment Assistance Australia which will be DEET's case management organisation, formed from part of the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ESRA will promote competition and fair and efficient market conduct. These arrangements are intended to meet the needs of job seekers, employers and the local community while maintaining high standards of accountability and probity in the use of the public resources. The longer term aim of the legislation is for job seekers to have a choice of case manager. The legislation also ensures that there are reciprocal obligations on job seekers through the use of Case Management Activity Agreements which will outline an agreed course of action for the case manager and job seeker. Agreements will focus the efforts of case managers and job seekers firmly on attaining employment for job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Employment Service and Employment Assistance Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation establishes the Commonwealth Employment Service within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This provision confirms that Australia will continue to meet its obligations under ILO Convention No 88 to provide a free public employment service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is provision for the establishment of a national committee to advise the National Director on the operations of the CES. A CES Advisory Committee already operates and will continue to operate under the provisions of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also provision for the establishment of Area Consultative Committees (ACCs). <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation </EMPHASIS>allows for the establishment of up to sixty area consultative committees to consist of representatives from local businesses, community organisations, local and state governments, regional development bodies, training providers and unions. These committees will provide an avenue for local input to program and service delivery decisions to ensure that CES services will complement local development and employment initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation establishes Employment Assistance Australia as a separate organisation, within the department, to provide case management services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its regulatory functions, ESRA will monitor the operations of Employment Assistance Australia and make recommendations to the Minister about those operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case management system</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation </EMPHASIS>the government made an undertaking to tackle long term unemployment by providing individually tailored case management services. Case management involves a one-to-one service provided to job seekers with the objectives of placing them in jobs by matching their skills and capabilities with the requirements of employers. Case managers will provide continuing support to the job seekers before, during and after the program of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case managers will work with the job seekers to negotiate Case management activity agreements. This will set out a course of action tailored to the particular needs of the job seeker and agreed between the case manager and the job seeker.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case managers will provide counselling and job search assistance. This will be supported by access to labour market programs, such as vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills and community-based work experience or subsidised employment. The case management strategy will ensure that suitable assistance is offered and that the job seeker has an obligation to pursue agreed plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participants in the case management system</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation </EMPHASIS>provides that case management will be available to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">short-term unemployed people assessed by the CES as being at high risk of becoming long term unemployed;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">those who have been registered as unemployed with the CES for 12 months and are eligible for newstart allowance;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">those covered by the Youth Training Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to make a written determination of the groups of persons, such as those I have just outlined, who are to become participants in the case management system. With this provision the government and ESRA will be able to manage the case management system so that the most effective use is made of available case management resources. This arrangement will be used to tailor assistance, in the first instance, to those in most need and those who are reaching certain points in being unemployed, such as those who are reaching the 12 months point of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As time goes by, case management can be extended by the Government to other groups of unemployed persons, or otherwise be modified to reflect changing needs and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Referral to case managers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CES will be required to notify and interview persons as they qualify to become participants in the case management system in order to assess their needs prior to referring them to case managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making a referral, the CES must have primary regard to the client's preference for a case manager and several other considerations which are set out in a disallowable instrument, including the local availability of case managers and their ability to meet the particular needs of the client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longer term objective is that clients are able to make an informed choice of case manager and that the CES decisions would reflect few changes to job seekers' nominations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case management services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the responsibilities of ESRA will be to fully determine what are and are not considered to be case management services, which will be set out in a disallowable instrument. The case management market will be subject to considerable innovation over time and the use of a disallowable instrument will enable ESRA to respond to such changes while ensuring job seekers' interests are being met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of delivering case management services, a case management activity agreement will be developed and agreed between the case manager and the job seeker. The requirements of the case management activity agreement will give force to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> emphasis on the reciprocal obligations of job seekers, especially those who have become eligible for the Job Compact. For example, the case management activity agreement will require a Job Compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under New Work Opportunities or the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Contracted case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her Agreement and to provide relevant information to the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will also require the job seeker's compliance with the case management activity agreement. The legislation provides that a case management activity agreement will take the place of a Newstart Activity Agreement or a Job Search Activity Agreement for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991. Failure to enter into a case management activity agreement or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreement will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a job search or newstart activity agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements. In other words, it will lead to a deferment of allowances fora period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accreditation of case managers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ESRA will have the power to accredit case managers and its regulatory functions will be exercise primarily through the use of this power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The details of the accreditation scheme are st out in a disallowable instrument. ESRA will make decisions to accredit case managers and to vary or cancel their accreditation. It will also be able to set and vary conditions of accreditation. ESRA may also issue a formal warning if a case manager contravenes a condition of accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accreditation scheme will stipulate conditions which must be met before an applicant can be accredited s a case manager. It will also stipulate conditions which must be met in the ongoing delivery of, and reporting on, case management services to ensure that accreditation is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of a disallowable instrument to set out the detail of the accreditation scheme will allow ESRA to vary conditions of accreditation as the needs of the client group or the industry itself changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does, however, stipulate that a case manager may not demand or receive any fees from a job seeker for the provision of case management services. All case management fees are to be paid by ESRA. In addition the legislation requires case managers to lodge case management activity agreements with the CES and to provide information to the Secretary of DEET concerning a job seeker's compliance with a case management activity agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the more significant accreditation decisions ESRA will be empowered to make is to specify classes of case management services. ESRA will ac credit case managers to provide either general case management services and/or one or more classes of specialist case management services. The initial classes of specialist case management services are likely to include, but not be limited to, services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities, people from a non-English speaking background, youth and people seeking employment in particular industries. ESRA will be able to change specialist classes as expertise develops and increasing numbers of case managers make specialisation in case management services more viable. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once a case manager has been accredited, ESRA may enter into contractual arrangements with that case manager for the provision of case management services. Contracted case managers will be paid by ESRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rules of conduct</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements for the accreditation scheme stipulate adherence to rules of conduct declared by ESRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All rules of conduct are contained in a disallowable instrument, thereby allowing the scrutiny of Parliament over the regulation of the industry. Rules of conduct will also be published by ESRA and their operation will be monitored, evaluated and reported upon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disallowable instruments were tabled on 20 October 1994. Public hearings were held in Melbourne on 9 November 1994 and in Sydney on 10 November 1994. The period of public consultation runs until 21 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Codes of Practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ESRA Board may declare codes of practice that relate to the provision of case management services. Codes of practice will be advisory in nature and ESRA will evaluate and monitor compliance with the codes of practice and report to the Minister on the operation of the relevant section of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET assistance to case managers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of the legislation DEET will provide two types of assistance to contracted case managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in addition to what is required in the referral process, DEET may be required to assist case managers, for example, by ensuring that information about the case management system and local case managers, perhaps in pamphlet or poster form, is available through CES offices. Any assistance which the CES is required to give to case managers is set out in a disallowable instrument; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the Department Information Technology Assistance Scheme, also detailed in a disallowable instrument, will cover those aspects of information technology assistance the Department is required to give case managers from time to time. It is envisaged that DEET would charge case managers for Information Technology assistance on a cost-recovery basis and that the details of the charges would be among the matters covered in the disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Establishment of Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has made the commitment to provide case management services to all long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. This will involve approximately 500,000 people. The services are to be opened up to outside competition to help meet this commitment. Community and providers are to be funded to operate in fair and open competition with EAA in the delivery of case management services. Wherever possible, people being case managed will be able to choose between government and non-government providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has set clear targets for the numbers of cases it expects non-government providers to manage. In 1994-95, 10 per cent of cases will be managed by external providers. This will be increased to 20 per cent in 1995-96 and 30 to 40 per cent in 1996-97. The commitment to case management and the introduction of competition in its provision will ensure better outcomes for the long-term unemployed, improved levels of services for employers and better value for the money committed to funding the services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with the introduction of competition into other areas of government monopoly, there is a need for a regulatory authority. The legislation establishes ESRA and sets out its functions, powers and arrangements to allow the appointment of a board and chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation allows ESRA to regulate the case management system primarily through its powers to accredit and select contracted case managers. It is also given specific powers to promote competition and to monitor, evaluate and report to the Minister on the operations of the case management system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation allows for an ESRA Board to be established with a Chairperson and between two to five members. The Board will have the responsibility to determine policies and will direct the Chief Executive Officer. The Governor-General will appoint Board members and the CEO by written instrument. Remuneration will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The appointments of both the Chairperson and the CEO are expected to be on a full-time basis. To promote linkages with the activities of NETTFORCE, the Chairperson of ESRA will be a member of the NETTFORCE board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure probity and effective performance of Board members, the Legislation requires declarations by Board members of direct and indirect pecuniary interests in any matters being considered by the ESRA Board. The Governor-General will have the power to terminate the appointment of a Board member on grounds of conflict of interest, unauthorised absence, bankruptcy or otherwise unsatisfactory performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigations by ESRA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides investigative powers for ESRA to ensure the highest quality case management for unemployed persons and stringent measures against fraud and malpractice. ESRA will be able to investigate the action of the CES in referring people and providing assistance to case managers. It may also investigate the adherence of contracted case managers to conditions of accreditation, contractual conditions and rules of conduct. ESRA will also be able to investigate any contraventions of the Departmental Information Technology Assistance Scheme, rules relating to the use and return of case management documents and the duty of non-disclosure of information about clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some matters which come to ESRA's notice may be more appropriately dealt with by the Ombudsman, a Departmental Secretary, the Trades Practices Commission or the Privacy Commissioner. The legislation also allows ESRA to refer such matters to these Agencies. Obligations in relation to client rights and protection, such as those covered by the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information Act and the Ombudsman Act, equivalent to those that apply to the Australian Public Service, will be imposed on contracted case managers, contracted case managers' adherence to anti-discrimination legislation will exist by virtue of separate legislation in those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Monitoring of Compliance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further ensure that there are effective anti-fraud measures and safeguards against malpractice, the legislation enables ESRA to appoint inspectors with formal powers to undertake searches, gather information and seize documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These powers may be exercised for the purpose of monitoring compliance by case managers with the conditions of their accreditation and the agreements under which they are engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of Decisions relating to referral to Case Managers and Decisions Relating to Case Management Activity Agreements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clients will be referred to case managers by the CES taking into account client preferences, needs, and the circumstances of local case managers. The legislation provides for access to a review of this decision by an Authorised Review Officer. Appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is also provided for. There will also be access to these review mechanisms with respect to decisions about case management activity agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of ESRA Decisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A case manager, or a prospective case manager, may request a review by ESRA of a decision ESRA has made about its accreditation or disqualification. The legislation also allows for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision that has been confirmed or varied by ESRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with standard requirements for regulatory authorities, the ESRA Board is to furnish an annual report, for tabling in Parliament. It is intended that the report will cover concerns which the CES has reported to ESRA regarding the activity testing efforts of EAA and contracted case managers and will include evaluation of how rules of conduct and codes of practice are operating and the extent to which contracted case managers meet the standards required by their accreditation conditions. The annual report will also include a copy of ESRA's audited financial statements and  any directions given to it by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation reflects a bold and imaginative venture by the Federal Government. Together with the Job Contract and new incentive to employers through training and wage subsidies, it will better equip us to tackle unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment. It will encourage into this field many community and business organisations which will bring with them special expertise, local knowledge and links with employers. In doing so they will provide a much wider range of choice of service for job seekers, and improve job seekers' chances of returning to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents a radically new approach. There is currently no well developed non-government case management market and many providers will be learning as they go. Equally for the government and for ESRA it will be very much a matter of learning by doing. While the legislation seeks to be as specific as possible, it also reflects the certainty that many new problems will emerge over time and there will be a need to set down detailed aspects of the new arrangements quickly to address unanticipated needs and problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation includes a number of safeguards against inappropriate use of powers. It provides for disallowability of instruments that define a number of key aspects of the arrangements. This will allow Parliamentary scrutiny of those arrangements. At the same time, the legislation gives ESRA and the Minister the power to act quickly and effectively to ensure proper protection of one of the most vulnerable sections of our community&mdash;long term unemployed people&mdash;from exploitation by the unscrupulous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes consequential amendments arising from the Employment Services Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill repeals Part VI of the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, under which the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) is currently established. The CES is being re-established by Clause 8 of the Employment Services Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the extension of the Privacy Act 1988 to the provision of case management services by contracted case managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 provide for members of the public to have rights of access to documents relating to case management services that are held by contracted case managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. The Ombudsman would be able to refer those complaints to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) where it is considered the complaint could be more appropriately dealt with by ESRA. The current provisions of the Ombudsman Act would already extend to the operations of Employment Assistance Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman would be able to provide information on matters relevant to the operation of the case management system to ESRA without the need to make a formal report to the responsible Minister in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends a number of provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the disclosure of information to contracted case managers by the Secretary to the Department of Social Security and to insert notes cross referencing relevant provisions to the Employment Services Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 also address difficulties created by recent amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1994. The amendments related to the reciprocal obligations of persons who receive Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance under that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments were intended to provide for a period of notice to an allowance recipient before a deferment period was imposed because she or he had breached her or his obligations under the Act. The intended effect was that a person would receive an additional two instalments (four weeks) of Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance before payment of allowance was cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practical terms, what these amendments seek to accomplish is a return to the procedures that existed prior to 4 July 1994. It is the Government's view that these procedures ensured that a person received sufficient notice of the consequences of failing to respond to a particular requirement made by the CES, before a decision was taken that the person was in breach of that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 4 July 1994 the process for activity test breaches was that when an apparent breach of the activity test was identified, the person was contacted by the CES and given an opportunity to explain why he or she had failed to meet the particular requirement (for example, a request to attend a job interview, or participate in a training course). If the person's explanation satisfied the CES that the person had taken reasonable steps to comply with the requirement, or had sufficient reason for not complying with the requirement on this occasion, he or she was informed of this and no breach action was taken. If on the other hand, the CES was not satisfied with the person's explanation, the person was told that breach action would proceed and that a penalty (deferment period) would be applied, usually at the end of the current allowance pay period. These procedures ensured that the person received direct, personal notice of the penalty before it was applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process ensured that a person was fully informed of the consequences of his or her failure to respond to a specific requirement to contact or attend the CES. If the person did not respond within 14 days of the first requirement, a second warning letter was sent to the person, reiterating the requirement and stating explicitly that if the person did not contact or attend the CES by a date 14 days hence, the person's allowance would be cancelled. This second letter not only gave the person a second chance to respond, but also gave prior notice of the penalty and when it was likely to be imposed, if the person failed to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined these procedures as part of its consideration of the proposed amendments. On the whole, the Committee was satisfied that the procedures provided sufficient notice of deferment of income support, without the need for additional payment periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have also raised a number of matters of administrative and technical concern for both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training who are responsible for the administration of this legislation. For example, a deferment period cannot be expressed to commence until after the notice specifying the commencement date is actually received by the client. Therefore the decision maker is being asked to make a decision on an event about which he or she could not be certain at the time the decision is made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to lunch, I was addressing some comments about the issue of cooperation between the state and federal governments. I was speaking in response to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Collins). He said that the effect of our amendment mandating that the federal government consult with state governments would be that, if a state government were recalcitrant and did not cooperate, the process would fall down. The minister had picked on the Court government, saying that there would be quite a lot of potential for it to be recalcitrant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had made the point that every state government besides Western Australia had agreed to pass complementary legislation under the native title regime, although none of those pieces of legislation have been proclaimed. The Western Australian government passed its own legislation, which both the federal and state governments regard as being not complementary. I also made the point that the Court government in practice had been extremely cooperative with the National Native Title Tribunal. Senator Chamarette has been made aware of that in hearings. I think it would be worthy of the minister if he is aware of the facts&mdash;and he may not be&mdash;to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Aboriginal affairs people within the Premier's department have regular contact with the Native Title Tribunal people in Perth, and the Lands Titles Office in Perth is providing total access to all the tenure histories. These are all very important matters for the Native Title Tribunal to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I would say in response to this matter&mdash;because it is important and I am not going to let any federal government minister get away with bashing Richard Court and his Aboriginal affairs policies; we may not agree with all of them; I am sure Senator Chamarette does not either&mdash;you cannot ignore the fact that one of the first things Richard Court did when he became Premier of Western Australia was to commission a task force on Aboriginal social justice. To this inquiry he appointed Mike Daube, who could never be considered a Liberal Party sympathiser and was formerly a very active member of the health department and a strong campaigner on smoking and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be happy to actually table the reports of this inquiry if I were given leave, but they are readily available. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Daube inquiry: the task force on Aboriginal and social justice</EMPHASIS>, volumes 1 and 2, makes excellent reading. I know the minister probably has far too much to read already, like all of us. But I do thoroughly recommend reading the volumes of this report. They give I think&mdash;and I do not know whether Senator Chamarette has read them&mdash;an absolutely thorough analysis of the delivery of services to Aboriginal people in Western Australia, state and federal government assistance and programs, and a very thorough analysis of past failures and recommendations for the future. I might even just send this across the chamber when we adjourn tonight so that the minister can read the executive summary. It will only take him a couple of minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I will not delay too long as that is not really what I am trying to, but I will respond when the minister criticises the Court government in relation to this issue. There is a perception amongst the community that the Labor Party seems to care more about Aborigines than does the Liberal Party. We know from past history that that is not the case, that it is just not simply true or fair. But the perception exists out there and, of course, in politics perception is reality. But I repeat: the perception is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Court government received this report, the cabinet considered it thoroughly and made what is a most unprecedented response to it: it has undertaken to implement each and every recommendation of the report. To do it may take a while, but they have made that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations&mdash;and I refer specifically to page 280 of volume 1 of the task force on Aboriginal and social justice&mdash;do refer to the issue of Commonwealth-State relations. I will quote from that, but I want to quickly quote from some of the other leading recommendations. One is, the need to establish a comprehensive state Aboriginal affairs policy. Remember, this report came out after 11 years of Labor government in Western Australia, with ministers, such as Ernie Bridge, a very dedicated Aboriginal affairs minister, and 11 years of federal Labor government. It is committed to Aboriginal affairs and has won a perception for the Labor Party that it is dedicated to Aboriginal affairs. This is a report that takes a snapshot of Aboriginal affairs after 11 years of federal and state Labor governments. This is the report which Mr Daube authored as chairman. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Comprehensive state Aboriginal affairs policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>11 years on, no policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.More effective consultation with Aboriginal people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>something we are advocating here today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A strategic plan for Aboriginal affairs achieving long-term and short-term objectives;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.An influential department responsible for Aboriginal affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Is that not incredible? The state does not have an influential department for Aboriginal affairs after 11 years of Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.A reliable and up to date database for planning;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Effective monitoring and evaluation of mechanisms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Increased accountability in relation to funding and better processes to ensure that funds are directed to those they are intended to assist&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>intended to assist&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.More effective coordination between the levels of government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this comes to the very heart of this amendment. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.More effective coordination between the levels of government within government and regionally&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, again, right to the heart of this amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and between government and non-government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on&mdash;we have had the two volumes of the report tabled so we will not read all 296 recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the role of the task force to apportion blame for problems of the past or to identify in any other than broad terms why certain problems now obtain. It is, however, important not to avoid the issue that we currently have virtually parallel systems aimed at dealing with Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>This goes back to the issue of duplication that we were discussing before lunch. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of these parallel systems results in much duplication and even more confusion and cannot be seen as working to the benefit of either Aboriginal people or the community at large. The remit of this task force is to consider the role of State government agencies. The role of Commonwealth agencies is, however, of such importance that it is relevant to discuss their role and structure also, in the context of making structured recommendations on a more fruitful and co-operative relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no documentation clearly identifying the respective roles of Commonwealth and State governments. While there is implicit agreement and relatively satisfactory working arrangements in some areas, both in other areas and overall the situation is unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA>I recommend this report to the minister, particularly the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner. I guess it would be against his principles to read anything that emanated from WA, just on the basis that it came from that state. But it provides very good reading. I certainly hope that the people who have responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, both within PM&amp;C and, of course, Minister Tickner's office, would at least read some of that report. Even if one research officer were to read it, it might help relations between Western Australia and the Commonwealth in this very important area. The issue of consultation which is highlighted in that report again makes the case for the amendment that would require consultation with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of timing was raised by Senator Kernot and by the minister, again building up this picture that all of this consultation would ensure that it would take forever to get these strategies up and running. I will knock that argument over as quickly as I can. The minister argued this morning that the current consultation provision&mdash;that is, that you must consult with the ATSIC regional office and then you can consult with whoever else you may think is appropriate&mdash;was a catch-all that would obviously envisage consultation with other people in the area and possibly even, dare we suggest it, state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that if the ILC operates efficiently, as we hope and expect it would, as a matter of course, it would negotiate with the state governments and, as a matter of course, it would, we would hope, negotiate with other land councils and other Aboriginal communities that would have a stake in the process. The reality is that by actually saying, `We think you should do this and it is important that you do it,' the time that it takes to do it should make no difference because if the job is done properly, these things should be done, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, if you wanted to go to the Kimberleys in Western Australia&mdash;and this is a very practical example&mdash;you would be mad not to speak to the Aboriginal affairs people within the state government. You would be absolutely stupid not to do so. They have shown they will cooperate. They have already cooperated with the Native Title Tribunal. When the ILC goes there and starts determining its regional strategy, we know that in effect it would probably be a matter of ringing up the Premier's office or Minister Kevin Prince's office, making an appointment and having a briefing from those officers who are responsible for that part of the government's land policy in relation to Aboriginal affairs. The briefing, I am quite sure, would take possibly half an hour or an hour. They could quickly lay on the table some maps, programs and policies and be cooperative, and that meets the requirement of this provision. I think that is all that it practically takes. It is just common sense and I think it is important that it be mandated and not left to the ILC. I think it would be inadvisable for it not to proceed along this track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on the point of timing, I summarise by saying that the answer to the question raised by Senator Kernot by way of interjection is that if the ILC is doing its job properly, it will not take one nano-second longer under the provision that the Greens and the coalition are supporting than it would under the existing provision in the bill. It would not take one nano-second longer to get the strategies up and running and get the funding into operation. </PARA>

However, it would be different if the board had a good reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles that we are supporting in this amendment ensure that in the legislation there will be an obligation to have an integrated strategy that is open and able to be assessed for its validity. That is not to constrict anything. It is to help the Aboriginal community see that there is something in place to balance justice and equity across Australia. I think there is a danger of ad hoc allocations, even on urgency. I am one of the worst offenders. If something is urgent, I am more likely to address it than if it is important. I think that is the same danger here, where we have a very small amount of money. </PARA>

By allowing that whole process, even if it is in relation to management, to hold matters up is a problem. I see not putting a time limit as leaving it in the ILC's hands as to how it devises that strategy. Hopefully, it will balance the immediate and urgent needs that we have had in this country for years and years of the need to establish credibility as an equitable agency in terms of allocating the funding, whether it is for management or acquisition.

<PARA>This amendment relates to section 191N(6), which relates to the tabling of the national strategy. Subsection (7) says that the minister must cause a copy of the national indigenous land strategy, or any changes to it, to be presented to each house of parliament within 15 days of that house sitting after the minister has received the document. There may be a typographical error there; my copy does not have `the house sitting'. I think it should have that in there. In any event, I will return to that in a moment.

<PARA>On behalf of the opposition, I can see that there is some concern with subsection (9) because that would mean that nothing could happen until that time for disallowance had passed. I note Senator Kernot's reservations about how long the formulation of these strategies might take and how that might delay the delivery of this benefit to those for whom to it is intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is conscious of that one. However, the problem is that if we are to make it disallowable and say, `In the meantime, you can go ahead and purchase the land and perform your other functions as outlined therein,' and the ILC has gone ahead and purchased land and entered into all sorts of arrangements and then we disallow it, we run into trouble because it has then acted in a way which is ultra vires really because we have now disallowed the strategy. We cannot untangle the web which already would have been weaved. That is why we have inserted subsection (9). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main interest that the coalition has in this amendment is in subsections (7) and (8); that is, for parliament to have some sort of scrutiny over the strategy. It may be argued that if we set up a board like the ILC, we should not have any scrutiny. I would point to other areas where regulations are made, are subject to scrutiny and all sorts of instruments  are disallowable across a whole range of activity in the quasi-government jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would take a majority to disallow it, so it would be no mean thing if, say, the Aboriginal community at large were at great odds with this national strategy and went to its elected representatives and said, `Look, we don't like the strategy as it is. We want it changed. We believe the ILC has not considered the matter carefully enough and we want parliament to debate the matter and to disallow it.' Of course, if the matter were of sufficient importance and attracted a majority of parliament, I would submit that it would need to be ventilated in this place. It would have to be the coalition plus the Greens, an Independent, the Democrats or even the government agreeing. Nonetheless, for it to be disallowed it would have to be a matter of grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is perhaps more ambivalent about subsection (9), to the extent that there are conflicting interests. We do not want to unnecessarily delay the delivery of the benefit. But, at the same time, we want to have some parliamentary scrutiny so that there is some other access for the strategy to be reviewed by parliament. It could be successfully reviewed only if there were a majority. I submit that, if we were able to get a majority to disallow, we would have to have pretty strong arguments to begin with. That is basically the sum of this amendment. </PARA>

It is because, if the ILC comes up with a strategy that the Aboriginal people do not like, those people have the option to see it on the table and if they do not like it they can go to any senator or member of the House of Representatives and say, `We do not like this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not disempower the Aboriginal people; it empowers them. Minister Tickner or Mr Keating&mdash;whoever the genius was who dreamt up this bill&mdash;created a system whereby we can have a national strategy but no-one can see it except for the minister and the members of the board. Not one single other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is allowed to see the national strategy. It is secret. This amendment ensures that every Australian can see it. That is what we are saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that (8) and (9) are now not so crucial to the opposition is that we have put in, with the support of the Senate&mdash;we did not have this support a few days ago&mdash;all of these other consultation provisions. We have provided that Aboriginals in the regional areas have to be consulted. The government's bill did not provide that they had to be consulted. We have now asked that these people be consulted. So the consultation is wider. The principle remains that there is no reason why any other Aboriginal Australian cannot see the strategy. I am glad that (7) will receive support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens feel that at all points our amendments have been directed to trying to make the ILC as separate from government as possible. We feel that, if we make it something that is answerable to parliament, while it may recognise that government component this may cause it to have more power than it should. We feel that the responsibility of the ILC is to be accountable primarily to the people. That is why we have moved the regional strategies approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our feeling is that, if the national strategy becomes a disallowable instrument, because our parliament has failed Aboriginal people I think almost totally in really meeting their aspirations, their dreams and their values, it would be inappropriate that we should have the final say, even if our democratic system were operating in such an effective way that we could represent all the Aboriginal people who are within the areas that we come from. </PARA>

All our amendments have been derived around controlling that in order that it be more responsive to the people and more separate from government control. The only measures that we have included are the ones that we feel support the ILC's accountability to Aboriginal people and communities. The measures that we resist are the ones that tie it into government. Unlike the opposition and perhaps Senator Harradine, I feel that parts (8) and (9) tie it in far too much to government and parliaments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ellison says that they definitely will not support it, but I will give it a go. I will firstly respond to what Senator Collins said about the strategy being available to any person. I was using political rhetoric by saying it is secret. The reality is that the requirement is that the minister and clearly the members of the board get the document. The advantage of having it tabled here is that, if there is any controversy about it, it will become a national political issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that virtually any Commonwealth document is available to anyone who asks. People can go to an Australian Government Publishing Service bookshop and get virtually any document that this Commonwealth government prints. It prints a hell of a lot each year. So I admit that saying it was a secret document was of course political rhetoric and not intended to deceive my colleagues in this chamber or anybody else. But the reality is that the importance of tabling it, which I have stated twice already and I am very glad it was supported by Senator Harradine, is that it places a constraint on the minister and the board because it ensures that the whole world is aware of the strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fine point about, and the importance of, part (8)&mdash;which I get to in a last-ditch effort to ask Senator Chamarette to support part (8)&mdash;is that the mere tabling of the document is, as Thomas Hobbs would have said, a covenant without a sword. It is of little effect. It does have the effect of ensuring that at least the document becomes public and, if people are unhappy with it, they can raise concerns about it. But the fact is that there is no penalty on the government if the strategy of the ILC does not reflect the hopes, aspirations and wishes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whom we seek to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the point that Senator Chamarette makes about trying to keep it away from this parliament, I understand her philosophy. I am learning more and more about her self-determination philosophy&mdash;particularly over the last few weeks&mdash;and am beginning to understand it. As Senator Chamarette and I have said privately, and even on the Howard Sattler program on 6PR the other morning, there is a meeting of the ultra libertarian, anti-institutional philosophy of the Greens&mdash;I am again putting words into Senator Chamarette's mouth&mdash;and the libertarian aspects of liberalism. Even though we respect some institutions, we are very worried about too much government control over people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a crucial issue. Part (8) is very important to me and that is why I said I would like to divide on it. The point I am getting to is that there is a difference. Many people in Australia think of parliament as government. They think we have too much government because we have local, state and federal parliaments. They conceive that government is actually all of the members of parliament, in their white cars and with their flashy allowances and overseas travel. Highly intelligent business colleagues of mine in Perth say, `Look, surely we could cut government by getting rid of state parliaments.' A bit of expenditure would be cut but parliaments are not a particularly expensive part of government. Senator Chamarette understands this because, on all of these principles of making government accountable to the parliament, she is always on our side. Just about every time since she has been here, she has voted with us when we have tried to have Auditor-General's inquiries, more responsiveness&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably drawing a long bow. My point is that this is making the ILC accountable to all of the people and specifically to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have an enormous stake in this. As I said, the ILC's land strategy can be tabled if one has a covenant without a sword&mdash;to steal Thomas Hobbes's idea&mdash;but, if it does not satisfy the people and they are not happy with it, there is no covenant and no disallowability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking away the thing that I know worries Senator Chamarette most&mdash;which is that people cannot go and buy something until the national strategy is finalised&mdash;gets over the major hurdle. It is just saying that the strategy has to reflect the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. If it does not they will ring up Senator Chamarette, me, Senator Ellison and the minster and say, `This is just a disgrace. We want you to disallow it.' Without that disallowance provision, part (7) loses a bit of its clout. I ask that Senator Chamarette give consideration to this. Time will ensure that a vote will not be able to be taken on this amendment tonight but I hope that, over the weekend or on the plane back to Perth, Senator Chamarette gives this amendment some serious consideration. </PARA>

The secret army to which I refer is that group of Anzacs who were in fact ethnic Chinese and who, by virtue of the regulations of the day, were never meant to have been allowed to enlist in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that, prior to the outbreak of the war, Australia's first years of Federation were absorbed in part by the efforts of the unions and the Labor Party to impose the White Australia policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many think that the Chinese population of Australia in the 19th century was composed entirely of itinerants on the goldfields, the truth is different. In fact, Chinese Australians were market gardeners, cabinet-makers, labourers, merchants and shopkeepers, but it was their role as shepherds and shearers in New South Wales that was most contentious, for it was part of the basis for the formation of the Australian Workers Union. In his poem, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Bushman's Song</EMPHASIS>, Banjo Paterson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked a cove for shearin' once, along the Marthaguy:</PARA>

<PARA>One of the motivations for the formation of the union movement was the influx of Chinese workers into the pastoral industry, and the fear of their arrival in Queensland may have been one of a few factors behind the shearers' strike. Certainly the term `scab' was applied to the non-union Chinese who were thought to carry leprosy.

After my height, weight, and chest measurement had been taken by one of the officials there I was sent to the medical officer. Upon going before him I was told to get dressed again, and when I asked if I had failed to pass the medical officer said he would not swear me in. When leaving the depot, I received a certificate with "not substantially of European origin" written on it, and signed by the medical officer, Captain N. J. Gerrard. With the exception of being asked where I came from, I was not asked one question whilst before the medical officer.

England and France deem it fit to use coloured troops to defend their shores, but the great Australian democracy denies its own subjects the same opportunities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal government has a policy that it is not implementing. It is called the national forest policy but, like many of this government's promises, it exists on paper only. The government has taken the jargon, used the rhetoric and hoodwinked us into believing that it might do something to protect our forests. Thanks to Senator Collins's recent information, we now know that there are still no adequate comprehensive and representative areas protected by the policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had about two years in which to implement it and it has only year to go before it is all supposed to be finished. But nothing is being done. I understand that, as part of the permit process, the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) has to consider the advice of the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). But the way the woodchip export licence for north-eastern New South Wales was granted to Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boral, illustrates just how poorly this government implements its own policies and just how useless that process is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner offered quite reasonable advice to Mr Beddall in that process, advice which sought to protect the best areas of old-growth and wilderness forest from logging, which sought to protect endangered species, and which attempted to set in place the comprehensive adequate and representative reserve system that the government's own policy requires. According to a detailed analysis by North East Forest Alliance, whose series of successful land and environment court actions in New South Wales has forced New South Wales State Forests to improve its EIS processes and endangered fauna measures, Mr Beddall's licence process is a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 26 recommendations made by Senator John Faulkner, 17 were not accepted, four were heavily modified and only five were accepted without change. I suggest that it is the five that were the least onerous in terms of Mr Beddall's interpretation. Some examples of those rejected recommendations were: that areas nominated for wilderness should be excluded; that habitat trees should be identified and protected; and that harvesting should preserve adequate vegetation to protect water quality and habitat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Mr Beddall has thrown out most of the environment minister's advice and put a little window-dressing in its place. But he has not stopped there. He has indicated to Boral that he will `consider issuing an additional licence to cover the increased volume if that proves necessary.' Where does that leave the government's commitment to phase out export woodchipping by the year 2000? Perhaps that was another joke like the licence and its other policies. If we return to the Boral licence we see that Mr Beddall in flagrant disregard for of government's commitment wrote, `I will consider issuing an additional licence to cover the increased volume if that proves necessary.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notes I have here describe Mr Beddall's `incompetence', but I would suggest that as the resources minister he has been particularly overzealous and he is leading to deliver us an impotent environment minister. Whatever way we describe it, what we are left with is a failure to actually implement government policy. I really do not know what it is that is being implemented. We have a thing called government policy but that is not what is being implemented. It is perhaps an ideology or a direction, but it is not what is publicly paraded as government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It extends to the heart of Mr Beddall's responsibilities under the Environment Planning (Impact of Proposals) Act. Under that act, he is required to ensure that there is proper environmental assessment where there may be significant impact on the environment. That is the clue that delivers us exactly what it is he is guilty of. Under that act, he is guilty of incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in his wisdom Mr Beddall has decided that the current environmental impact statement for the Sawmillers' export licence should suffice not just until 1996 but perhaps for 10 or 15 years more. Not only does this prevent the federal government from phasing out woodchipping by the year 2000, but it is also questionable implementation of the legislation. Mr Beddall's suggestion that Boral's use of woodchips from sawmill residues and logging residues does not have a significant environmental impact is plainly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry has developed the euphemism `integrated logging' to describe what is little more than forest mining. About half of the logs that are taken from the forest under clear-felling are woodchipped. The country does not get the sort of economic benefit from woodchipping that is touted by the government. The ordinary people of Australia lose out in two ways with export woodchipping. They lose the forests, our unique wild and diverse areas, and they lose out economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodchipping mills account for only one per cent of jobs in the forest industries and since the arrival of woodchipping in Tasmania more than 4,000 jobs have been lost from the forest industry. According to the Resource Assessment Commission's timber industry inquiry, native forest logging, including woodchipping, has run up a $5 billion debt over time with the state forestry commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beddall's woodchip troubles did not start with the Boral licence, they started during his early days in the portfolio. In June this year Mr Beddall announced that he had granted an export licence to Gunns Ltd in Tasmania to ship 200,000 tonnes of woodchips from Bell Bay or Burnie. At the time the company had no buyer for this product and it did not know where it was going to send it from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In documents obtained by the Australian Democrats under freedom of information, we discovered that Mr Beddall failed to require an EIS for this approval, arguing that the additional volume did not require an additional EIS. The minister seems very keen to exercise his ministerial discretion where the woodchip industry is concerned but not when the environment is at risk. The result of Minister Beddall's work on these two licences is that he is now facing two Federal Court actions which question his competence as a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a government policy designed to provide resource security to the timber industry&mdash;a frightening prospect for the community's interest in our public forests. Sadly, the national forest policy is another example of this government's broken promises. It is a policy which would be mediocre at best anyway, with a handful of useful commitments the government has been unwilling to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the federal government will blame it on the states, which also signed the statement, but the states must also share some of the blame. Their performance has been appalling. While all this finger pointing is going on, the forests are falling day by day; ecosystems are being destroyed day by day; and our environment is ravaged day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In issuing the export licences, the federal government has the opportunity and the responsibility to slow down that deadly destruction. The federal government can protect the forests of high conservation value, but it must actually want to do it. At the very least, the government should surely uphold its own policy, minimally satisfactory as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could at least protect forests of high conservation and wilderness value. What we do not need is more silence from the Prime Minister on the issue, more irresponsible decisions by an incompetent resources minister, and more of our best areas disappearing into the chipper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an act of such shame. It is an act for which our children and our grandchildren will hold us responsible. The governments are not robbing just a few jobs; they are robbing our entire future in this area. It is now that we have the opportunity to protect these forests and I implore the government to implement its own policies and act to save the forests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to draw to the Senate's attention the most unfortunate circumstances in which a fellow Australian finds himself in the United Arab Emirates. The gentleman is Mr Eric Robert Bowra, a respected boat builder from Fremantle, Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bowra earlier this year travelled to the Middle East, as he had often done in the past, to secure a boat contract. He took with him an aluminium chaser boat which was to be looked at by the United Arab Emirates government. During a sales exercise on 5 August Mr Bowra took on board an air force colonel from that country, who was a guest for the day and who participated in the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later that day, the colonel drove another speedboat in the vicinity of the demonstration boat that Mr Bowra was driving. The colonel was accompanied by his son, and Mr Bowra had a passenger in his own boat. Whilst in the same vicinity, the two boats converged and it seems that the colonel turned incorrectly, contrary to nautical rules. Mr Bowra, being a skipper of some 16 years experience, anticipated that the colonel would turn the other way. As I understand it, Mr Bowra correctly steered to starboard, as was required by nautical rules in the circumstances. As a result of the collision, the colonel was killed and his son was severely injured. Mr Bowra survived the accident; however, his passenger too was injured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Australian government is under the misapprehension that Mr Bowra fled the scene. I am advised by Mr Bowra's lawyers that he in fact stayed on the scene. Help was rendered to the other stricken speedboat while Mr Bowra rendered assistance to his own passenger, who had a severe leg injury. The passenger was taken to a nearby vessel where first-aid facilities were on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at that stage, as I understand it, that a friend advised Mr Bowra that he had best leave the country as soon as he could. He decided on the spur of the moment that he would go to the airport and try to board the earliest plane possible out of the country. Airline officials became suspicious. They held him at the airport and he was arrested by police. Mr Bowra was charged with causing the death of the colonel and the injury to the colonel's son. The Australian government mistakenly thought that he had been charged with murder. He was not; it was simply an equivalent of a manslaughter charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 September this year a judge, finding that Mr Bowra had been in custody since 5 August, ruled that he had spent enough time in gaol and ordered his interim release. However, this was not complied with by the police and there was an appeal to the United Arab Emirates appeals court, which upheld the interim release order. Unfortunately, the police deemed that this too was irrelevant to the circumstances. Mr Bowra finds himself still in custody in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bowra last attended court on 25 October. It was expected that, in settlement of the charge, he could pay $55,000 to the colonel's family in satisfaction for the accident and that this would secure his release. However, the prosecution maintained a claim for the wrecked speed boat. The position is that the matter was not resolved and Mr Bowra was returned to prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bowra's next court appearance is this Sunday. It is feared by his friends and relatives that he could well face indefinite incarceration in that country. Although the Australian authorities have had low level contact with the United Arab Emirates government, unfortunately, to date, nothing has eventuated which can shed any light on the matter or provide any hope for Mr Bowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to this end that I implore the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, to use his good offices to intervene in this matter. This matter is viewed quite seriously by those who have been involved in the matter. Mr Bowra's lawyer is most concerned about his client's possible fate. Indeed, the case was reported on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having realised the efforts that Senator Evans went to recently in the kidnapping matter in Cambodia, and the effect which I understand it had on him, I ask Senator Evans to take this on board and put a personal input into it, as I fear this Australian citizen could well have been wrongly maligned and could well be facing an indefinite period of incarceration after not having had his case properly ventilated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always of concern that Australian nationals who go overseas find themselves the subject of the laws of other countries. We have to acknowledge that. We have to observe the international sensitivities that follow that. Nonetheless, in this country we still believe in a fair trial and in the fact that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I believe this case is most serious indeed and needs the full attention of the Australian government. Therefore, I implore the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use every effort to assist Mr Bowra in this matter. I believe the merits of this case require such attention. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is the Reserve Bank's understanding that Mr Johnson was made redundant following a restructure of the merged Tasmania Bank/Savings Bank of Tasmania; the decision to terminate his services was based on an independent assessment of his suitability for a management position in the merged bank.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Mr Johnson claims to have written anonymously to the Premier of Tasmania in June and August 1990; Mr Johnson's identity was not known to the Governor until it was revealed in his letter of 1 July 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Governor wrote to Mrs Johnson in reply to a letter received from her. The statements quoted reflect the Reserve Bank's belief that the decision to terminate Mr Johnson's services arose out of a review of the Bank's staffing requirements, and not from any communication between the Governor and Mr Kemp. See answer to Question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Mr Johnson claims to have been responsible for drawing to the attention of the Premier the existence of problems in Tasmania Bank. The Premier ordered an audit investigation of Tasmania Bank, which revealed the full magnitude of the bank's problems. During the relevant period the bank was being supervised under a voluntary arrangement by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank raised a number of issues of potential concern with the bank during this time but was assured by management that they were cognisant of the risks and were comfortable with the bank's position; the accounts of the bank had been subject to external audit and the Reserve Bank relied on the audit to detect any problems that were not evident in the data available to it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government recognises Indonesia's sovereign authority over East Timor. In 1979 the then Coalition Government extended de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. This has been maintained by successive Labor Governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The decision taken by the then Coalition Government to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor in 1979 is not for this Government to explain, but in the context of reaffirming Australia's recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over East Timor in 1985, the then Prime Minister Mr Hawke said that the fact of Indonesian control over East Timor had been demonstrated. The Government believes the best way to serve and advance the interests of the people of East Timor is by working constructively with the Indonesian Government within the framework of recognition of Indonesia's claims over the territory, rather than in a spirit of confrontation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Treasury received a letter of 29 March 1993 on this matter from solicitors representing one of the companies involved, replied to it on 13 April 1994 and has provided evidence subsequently in the court case between Packmore Merchandising and Austissue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not accept that the transitional assistance for recycled paper manufacturers should be directed to the company that pays sales tax on certain 100 per cent recycled paper products. The transitional assistance is deliberately targeted to specialist manufacturers of 100 per cent recycled paper for the production of toilet or facial tissues, paper bags or exercise books, ie to companies that use waste paper as the sole source of fibre input to the paper they manufacture. The transitional assistance enables specialist recycled paper manufacturers who invested in equipment used to make waste paper into 100 per cent recycled paper to adjust to the removal  of the sales tax exemption. The transitional assistance is not available to downstream companies, such as those that convert recycled paper manufactured by other domestic or overseas companies into final paper products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transitional assistance would be misdirected if, as suggested by Senator Coulter, it went to the company paying the sales tax on the affected 100 per cent recycled paper products. This is because sales tax is collected at the point of final wholesale sale, and the wholesaler, paper converter, or importer may have made no investment based upon the introduction of the sales tax exemption. Further, such arrangements would risk the duplication of compensation where the same stream of paper was involved in various transactions before the final wholesale sale. It would also lead to imported recycled paper products attracting the compensation, which would further disadvantage domestic products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There is no `unintended windfall' for the reasons provided at (1). The scheme is operating as intended. As indicated in the response to (1), the Government is aware of the dispute between the two companies.</PARA>
