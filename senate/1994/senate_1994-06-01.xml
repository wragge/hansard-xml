<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICAL PRODUCTS (COLLECTION OF INTERIM LEVY) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the house the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that on 1 March 1994 parliament passed a package of seven agricultural and veterinary chemical bills which included three levy bills and a collection bill. Commencement of those bills is dependent on the states and Northern Territory passing legislation adopting the agricultural and veterinary chemicals code. While the states and Northern Territory are attempting to pass the legislation in time for 1 July 1994 commencement of the scheme, it is by no means certain that this will occur and thus the cost recovery program for the national registration scheme might not be in place for 1994/95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals (NRA) was established in June 1993 as an independent, self-funding regulatory body to administer the national registration scheme. The NRA is now undertaking the evaluation of chemical products with the states providing the actual registration certificate by administrative arrangement, pending commencement of the March legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has therefore decided to introduce three interim levy bills and an interim collection bill to implement an interim cost recovery program. These bills will only apply for 1994/95 in the event that the March legislation is not in place by 1 July 1994. The cost to industry under this bill is the same as would be imposed  if the March legislation had commenced. The NRA will manage the cost recovery program associated with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interim levy will be a significant component of the scheme's cost recovery program. Other revenue will be collected through application fees. In 1994/95, 83 percent of the scheme's user-attributable costs will be recovered from the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will provide the NRA with the mechanism by which an interim levy on agricultural and veterinary chemical products can be collected. The bill identifies how liability for payment of an interim levy charge will be determined and the amount of the interim levy that will be imposed. Generally speaking liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of agricultural and veterinary chemical products manufactured in or imported into Australia. In addition the bill allows for the NRA to make an assessment as to whether a levy payment is required and the amount of the levy that is due. It also makes provision for a review process for persons dissatisfied with a levy assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects, giving effect to several previous announcements, including one measure announced in the 1993-94 Budget. It will also make a number of amendments which have not previously been announced.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital gains tax measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 12 January 1994, the Government announced proposed amendments to the capital gains tax provisions. This bill gives effect to all but one of the proposed amendments. The amendments relating to the assignment of prospective shares of interests in partnerships will be included in a bill to be introduced later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments fall into three broad categories:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, measures directed at emerging capital gains tax avoidance practices that, if left unchecked, would have posed a significant threat to the revenue at the expense of taxpayers generally;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, measures directed at reducing the capital gains tax compliance burden on taxpayers; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">thirdly, measures directed at redressing certain unintended consequences of the capital gains tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to express the Government's gratitude to representatives of the taxation profession for their suggestions as to how the proposals could be implemented to reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers and yet ensure that tax avoidance opportunities were closed off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Government has not accepted all of those suggestions, I am pleased to announce that it has accepted many of them. This has meant that some of the proposals announced have had to be modified. Full details of all the modifications at the initiative of the profession or the Government were included in a press release issued when this bill was introduced into the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the measures themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebatable dividend arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will counter certain arrangements that involve the avoidance of capital gains tax through the payment of rebatable dividends. The disposal consideration for shares in a company or the amount of capital treated as paid back on shares will include distributions made by the company that are treated as funded out of certain share premium amounts or revaluation reserves. Any capital gain computed having regard to the disposal consideration or the amount of capital paid back will not be reduced by the amount of the distributions that are treated as rebatable dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments relate to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">liquidators' distributions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">off-market share buy-backs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">other disposal of shares; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amounts of capital paid back on shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to disposals of assets after 12:00 midday Eastern Summer Time on 12 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure has the potential to prevent a significant future loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pre-acquisition profits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will deny any part of a capital loss to a controlling shareholder or associate that is attributable to distributions of pre-acquisition taxed or untaxed profits of the company in which the shares are held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to disposals of shares made on or after 24 March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure guards against a significant future loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Value shifting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove certain capital gains tax advantages of value shifting transactions involving shares. The amendments will apply to material shifts in value between shares held by the controller of a company and associates. A value shift will be material if the value shifted is at least the lesser of 5 per cent of the value of the shares or $100 000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to material shifts in value of shares effected after 12:00 midday Eastern Summer Time on 12 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will protect the capital gains tax revenue base and prevent a significant future loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Disposal of assets without a change in beneficial ownership</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present a change in the legal ownership of an asset without a corresponding change in beneficial ownership does not constitute a change in ownership and hence a disposal within the meaning of the capital gains tax provisions. The bill will ensure that this is so only in two situations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, on the establishment of a trust other than a unit trust over property previously owned by a person where that person, as beneficiary of a trust, remains absolutely entitled to it or would remain so if it were not for a legal disability; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">secondly, when there is a change in trustee without any other change in the ownership of the trust property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transfer of assets to a unit trust will constitute a change in ownership and so a disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply to changes in legal ownership of assets after 12:00 midday Eastern Summer Time on 12 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure has the potential to prevent a significant future loss to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of assets within company groups</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, a requirement for obtaining roll-over relief for transfers of assets within a wholly owned company group is that the transferor and transferee companies are group companies for the whole of the year of income in which the transfer takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will alter this requirement so that the transferor and transferee will only need to be group companies at the time of transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to disposals of assets in the 1993-94 income year and later income years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of assets within company subgroups</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that roll-over relief on asset transfers between group companies will not be recaptured if, in broad terms, the asset has remained in a company subgroup and the subgroup was disposed of by the parent company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to disposals of assets after 16 December 1992, the date of application of the relevant section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Group company capital loss transfers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that adjustments are made to the cost base of shares in a group company to which a loss is transferred and for subvention payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to agreements to transfer losses against capital gains derived in the 1993-94 or later income years, even if the loss was incurred in an earlier year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assets used by non-residents in Australian permanent establishments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital gains tax is payable on disposals of assets used by non-residents in permanent establishments in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that capital gains tax is paid by reference only to the gains that accrued during the period of use of the asset in the permanent establishment in Australia. Likewise, the bill will allow a capital loss only to the extent to which it accrued during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply only if the asset does not qualify as a taxable Australian asset under any of the other categories of taxable Australian assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will apply to disposals of assets after 12:00 midday Eastern Summer Time on 12 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will represent a cost to the revenue of less than $1 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Division 19A and liquidators' distributions </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that Division 19A of the capital gains tax provisions does not apply to in specie distributions made by the liquidator of a company to shareholders if the liquidation is completed and the company dissolved within a period of three years after liquidation proceedings commenced. The Commissioner of Taxation will be authorised to allow extensions of time in appropriate cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will be to the advantage of taxpayers and will apply to disposals of assets after 6 December 1990, the date of application of Division 19A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will result in an insignificant cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government incentive schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will exempt from capital gains tax the reimbursement or payment of certain expenses under Commonwealth, State or Territory incentive schemes as prescribed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to all reimbursements and payments of expenses made under the prescribed schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of this measure is less than $1 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of assessments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that the time limits normally applicable to the making of amended assessments do not apply to amendments that give effect to the time of acquisition or disposal of assets under a contract or the time of disposal of assets that are compulsorily acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also ensure that the time limits normally applicable to the making of amended assessments do not apply to amendments that give effect to the finding that a contract was a nullity from the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, the amendments to the law will apply to assessments made at any time. However they will not allow an amendment of an assessment that would increase a taxpayer's liability if the Commissioner of Taxation was prevented from amending the assessments as at the end of 11 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will result in an insignificant gain to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the capital gains tax changes, the bill makes amendments in a number of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Accruals assessability of certain securities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments being made by this bill to Division 16E of Part III of the Assessment Act will remove unintended tax deferral advantages of some securities covered by the Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax deferral occurs because Division 16E in its current form includes the fixed component of the return on variable return securities in assessable income by spreading it evenly over the term of the security. That form of accrual is inconsistent with economic reality. For declining balance securities, more income is earned in the earlier years and less in the later years. The greater the fixed component of the return from a security, the greater is the income deferral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend Division 16E so that all returns&mdash;both fixed and variable&mdash;from variable return securities will be brought to account under a compounding accruals accounting method.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This solution is already adopted in Division 16E in relation to fixed return securities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to Division 16E will apply to qualifying securities issued after 27 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are expected to result in revenue savings of $10 million in 1993-94, $18 million in 1994-95 and $26 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also remove an unintended consequence of Division 16E to securities issued in a series. It will ensure that if the first security issued in a series is not a qualifying security within Division 16E, securities issued later in the series, i.e. under the same terms and conditions, will not be qualifying securities either. It will apply to qualifying securities issued after the commencement date of Division 16E (16 December 1984) and should not have any revenue impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Secrecy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the secrecy provisions to let the Commissioner of Taxation tell the Health Insurance Commission whether or not a registered carer or an applicant for registration as a carer under the new childcare rebate scheme has a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment, which will not impact on the revenue, does not let the Commissioner of Taxation give the carer's tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">HECS: Inclusion in provisional tax calculation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also contains amendments to include Higher Education Contribution assessment debts in calculating provisional tax for the 1994-95 and later years of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure, announced in the 1993-94 Budget, complements the inclusion of HEC assessment debts in the PAYE arrangements and will bring forward revenue by approximately $12 million in 1994-95, $3 million in 1995-96 and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$2 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Offshore banking units</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offshore banking unit (OBU) concessional tax regime has now been in operation for over 18 months. While the Government does not yet know precisely how successful the new measures have been in establishing Australia as an offshore banking centre, the number of registrations and requests for advice suggest a reasonably high level of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been extensive consultation with the banking and finance industry and their advisers ever since the Government first announced its intention to tax OBU income at a concessional rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result the Government has now decided to extend the scope of possible borrowing and lending activities to include gold borrowings and gold loans. The measure will further promote Australia as a viable offshore banking centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government also recognises the need to balance the development of a viable offshore banking centre with the need to protect the revenue. The bill will also amend the OBU provisions to make it clear that a guarantee, letter of credit or performance bond must be in respect of activities of offshore parties and outside Australia in order to attract concessional tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity has also been taken to correct some minor technical deficiencies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the proposed sale of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System is an important part of both the Government's asset sales program and the Government's micro-economic reform agenda.  That I am standing here today speaking to this bill represents a considerable achievement on behalf of the Government to bring the Pipeline sale to fruition.  Every sale of a major Government asset is unique but few have presented the complexities associated with this sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's first attempt to sell the Pipeline was halted in December 1990 when the Senate rejected legislation to commercialise haulage tariffs. At that time the Government announced that it would not sell the Pipeline unless it could do so on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late last year the Government reaffirmed its intention to sell the Pipeline on the basis of a negotiated conditional sale of a 51 per cent stake to AGL, the Australian Gas Light Company, and a competitive tender for the remaining 49 per cent. In so doing, it has had regard to the fact that AGL holds a first right of refusal to acquire the Pipeline against both the Pipeline Authority and the Commonwealth, confirmed by the NSW Supreme Court in late 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement with AGL specified a range of conditions precedent, including that the Commonwealth would not proceed with the sale unless there is a successful completion of the competitive tender for the non-AGL stake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other key requirements are that buyers of the Pipeline enter into a new commercial gas haulage agreement with AGL and an agreement governing the use of, and access to, the Pipeline easements; and that there be resolution of the rights held by the Cooper Basin Gas Producers, appropriate approvals from the Trade Practices Commission, and authorisation by the NSW Gas Council of the proposed new gas haulage agreement. It is also necessary to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for the operation of the privately-owned Pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of this bill is to institute the necessary arrangements to  complete the sale by facilitating the transfer of specified assets and liabilities, other than debt, of the Pipeline Authority. It also provides for continuing employment of those staff who accept employment offers from the purchasers and preserves their accumulated benefits.  The bill embodies regulatory rules that would apply specifically to the Pipeline under private ownership, and provides for the limited operation of the Pipeline Authority post-sale and for its eventual abolition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pipeline transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin gas fields in South Australia to Sydney, regional centres in New South Wales and the ACT. It comprises approximately 1300 kilometres of trunkline from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. The trunkline includes two compressor stations at Bulla Park (west of Cobar) and at Young  in New South Wales.  It also includes pipelines from Young to Wagga, Young to Lithgow, Junee to Griffith, and from Dalton to Canberra and spur  pipelines to Cootamundra, Oberon, Junee, Orange and Bathurst.The Pipeline is currently owned and operated by the Pipeline Authority, a Commonwealth Statutory Authority established by the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. It has approximately 120 staff located throughout New South Wales, including Young and Cobar, with the head office in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The  Pipeline was constructed in the period 1974-76 after the Authority took over the project from AGL. In 1974,  the Authority entered into an agreement with AGL to carry, on a cost recovery basis, the gas AGL had contracted to buy from the Cooper Basin Producers over the thirty-year period to 2006.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The labyrinth of existing contractual arrangements accords AGL extensive rights, which will be relinquished in the context of the Pipeline sale transaction. These existing rights include a guarantee by the Commonwealth of the Authority's performance in hauling gas, absolute priority to the existing and future capacity of the Pipeline until at least 2006, haulage of gas on a cost-recovery basis until 2006, a right of first refusal to acquire the Pipeline, and a right of veto over any sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a part of the sale, AGL would enter into a new agreement with the privatised pipeline company for the haulage of gas (to be known as the "Gas Transportation Agreement"), thereby providing clear structural separation and transparency of the Pipeline's operations from those of AGL. This agreement would involve commercial haulage tariffs and facilitate arrangements for third party access to the Pipeline.  In return for releasing the Commonwealth and the Pipeline Authority from existing contractual commitments, AGL will receive compensation of $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly the Cooper Basin Gas Producers also have a number of rights, arising out of the Deed of Covenant and Consent, which have been in existence since 1974.  These include a veto over any sale of the Pipeline and a range of rights in respect of haulage of gas which have not been utilised over the past two decades other than priority of carriage of the gas sold to AGL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill incorporates provisions designed to ensure that  the private owner of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System will be able to operate on a normal commercial basis post-sale.  As part of this aim, the new pipeline company could not be fettered by any ongoing veto rights held by each of the Cooper Basin Gas Producers. In this respect the bill provides for the extinguishment of these veto rights, should the Government be unable to reach a negotiated outcome before the sale, whilst recognising the Producers' rights to compensation on "just terms" should they suffer a loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides flexibility in relation to the other rights held by the Producers, relating to the haulage of gas by the Pipeline. These include the option of transferring to the new pipeline company the obligation to satisfy these rights or, as with the veto rights, the alternative of extinguishing the rights.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government is very hopeful of concluding in the near future a negotiated settlement with the Producers, which may require amendment of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In purchasing the Pipeline a key factor for any prospective buyer is certainty regarding the regulatory environment that will apply. At the time the sale agreement with AGL was concluded in mid-November 1993 it was anticipated that passage of the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill  would have instituted the regulatory framework within which the new owner of the Pipeline would operate following completion of the sale in June 1994. However, as part of the agreement reached by the Council of Australian Governments on 25 February 1994, the Government deferred the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill in favour of the development by mid 1996 of a comprehensive package of competitive measures for the gas industry. While I fully support this decision it has meant that alternative regulatory measures have had to be developed in order to facilitate this sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures, which form Part 6 of the bill, constitute a comprehensive regime which specifically addresses the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline system, to govern that Pipeline's operations under private ownership. The regime introduces substantial improvements in the nature of third party access to the Pipeline, and thus represents a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to pro-competitive micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill currently before the Senate facilitates third party access to the Pipeline by obligating the owners of the Pipeline:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide open access on negotiated commercial terms and conditions, with the Trade Practices Commission to arbitrate where required;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to maintain effective separate accounting and separate management control of gas transmission pipeline operations and to provide for the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor haulage charges; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide information to relevant parties on haulage charges and terms and conditions for pipeline access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures should ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">users of  the Pipeline should not be able to frustrate new users obtaining access to spare and developable capacity  on reasonable commercial terms;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">all users, including existing users, should have access to presently uncommitted or new capacity on fair and equitable terms;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">tariff setting principles should be demonstrably fair and reasonable, "transparent" and should apply to all new haulage agreements; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the "lumpiness" of capital investment required to expand capacity should not fall disproportionately on the incremental user of the MSP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not prevent the Trade Practices Commission from investigating any behaviour that it considers may breach provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory regime will be administered by the responsible Ministers and existing institutions, that is, the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority or any general industry competition authority agreed following the Government's consideration of the Hilmer Report. In performing its arbitration role, the Trade Practices Commission would have regard, amongst other things, to any future national regime for third party access to essential facilities. It is recognised that relevant State authorities may need to be involved in arbitration hearings conducted by the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory regime was developed with the assistance of the Trade Practices Commission, and is intended to provide a suitable regulatory environment to facilitate the Commission's approvals for the sale to proceed. AGL and the Cooper Basin Gas Producers have been consulted on the proposed regime. Having regard to those consultations, the Government intends to introduce an amendment to the bill intended to clarify certain aspects of the proposed regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed regulatory arrangements will replace the existing unsatisfactory and potentially uncompetitive contractual arrangements applying to the Pipeline's operations. If instituted they will create an environment for the development of increased competition in the gas industry, based particularly on the statutory requirements for the Pipeline operator to provide open access to the Pipeline and information on haulage charges and underlying terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the sale, the Government proposes to create a new Commonwealth trading company which will not trade until the date of the sale, illustratively called "Newco" for the purposes of the bill.  The Commonwealth will sell shares in the company for a nominal amount to AGL and to the 49 per cent purchasers. Thereafter, the Commonwealth would execute an asset purchase agreement with Newco under which, among other things, assets (and certain liabilities except debt) would be transferred to Newco in exchange for the purchase consideration, which is expected to be in the order of  510 to 550 million dollars. The bill provides the legislative framework for those Pipeline Authority staff who accept an offer of employment with Newco to transfer to the new company with continuity of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale arrangements with AGL were negotiated on the basis of the Government providing Newco with initial working capital of 4 million dollars, as well as providing funds to cover accrued leave liabilities for those staff who transfer to Newco upon the sale.  The bill provides for payments of up to 6.5 million dollars to honour these obligations. These payments are expected to be largely recovered in higher sale proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the execution of the asset purchase agreement, Newco would enter into the new Gas Transportation Agreement with AGL and into an easement agreement with the Commonwealth relating to the joint ownership of certain easements by the Commonwealth and Newco. The easement agreement will limit Newco's rights to the use of the easements only for the operation and maintenance of the Pipeline. Newco will not be able to prohibit the building and operation of other pipelines on the same route.  The bill does not restrict the post-sale application to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline of  State Government pipeline licensing laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the Commonwealth to assume the debt obligations of the Authority to meet the Authority's private debt commitments and to discharge its public debt, and reflects transactions necessary for this assumption of debt to be properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this connection, it should be noted that since its establishment in 1973 the operations of the Pipeline Authority have been underwritten by debt financing. Construction of the Moomba to Sydney trunk pipeline from 1974 to 1976 was funded by loans from the Budget. Since that time the Authority's operations, including the construction of lateral pipelines, have been funded by public and private borrowings in addition to revenue earned from the haulage of gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assumption of the debt is necessary to avoid complications which may otherwise make the Pipeline difficult to market and to avoid any Commonwealth involvement with the business after the sale. At 30 June 1994, the Pipeline Authority is expected to have about 191 million dollars in debt on its balance sheet. This is expected to comprise about 130 million dollars of Commonwealth-guaranteed privately held inscribed stock and bank loans, and outstanding Commonwealth loans of approximately 61 million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A change of ownership for any organisation often leads to apprehension and insecurity for staff during the transition period. While many may view the change to be an opportunity, this is not always the attitude which prevails. The Government is sensitive to the impact on staff of the plans for the Pipeline's transition to private ownership, and it is therefore a central objective of the sale to ensure that staff of the Authority are treated equitably and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the prospective owners of Newco to make offers of employment to Authority staff, which will apply from sale day.  Offers would be made on the basis of terms and conditions of employment which are broadly equivalent to those which currently apply to employment with the Authority. Administrative arrangements for assessing whether an employment offer is broadly equivalent will be embodied in a "staff transfer agreement" to be made between the prospective purchasers of Newco, the unions representing staff, and the Authority. Staff accepting such offers would transfer to Newco with continuity of service preserved and full protection of rights accrued under Commonwealth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the bill provides for resolution of the case of those staff who reject an employment offer from Newco on the grounds that the terms and conditions are not broadly equivalent to those applying with the Authority. It is envisaged that the "staff transfer agreement" would establish an appeals committee with an independent chairperson, which would apply an agreed set of equivalence criteria. The bill provides for relevant staff to transfer to Newco after the sale day should they accept a revised offer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff who do not receive an offer of employment from Newco, and those who reject an offer which is determined by the appeals committee to be not broadly equivalent to their existing terms and conditions of employment, would be eligible for redundancy benefits. Those who reject an offer which is determined to be broadly equivalent would be deemed to have resigned and therefore would not be eligible for redundancy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made for the entire job offer and staff transfer process to take place after sale day, should it not be possible to implement it beforehand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to preserving continuity of employment for those staff who transfer to the new pipeline company and to preserving entitlements accrued by those staff while in the public sector to point of sale. Therefore, the bill provides for a number of "transitional and saving provisions" in respect of a variety of  Commonwealth legislation, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These provisions will ensure, in particular, that employees of the Pipeline Authority do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to the sale of the Pipeline.  They are similar to the provisions provided in the Qantas, CSL and SMEC sale legislation and ensure fair and consistent treatment of Government employees regardless of the method of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various transactions associated with the arrangements for sale of the Pipeline may attract liability for stamp duties. In the absence of other action, this would depress the expected returns to all taxpayers throughout Australia from the sale of the Pipeline and benefit taxpayers in a particular state only. As with other asset sales, to avoid these difficulties, transactions relating to the Pipeline sale are to be exempted from stamp duties. The bill also makes quite clear that the new company which is to own and operate the Pipeline will not have any immunity post-sale from such duties legitimately imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of the sale bill embodies amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 which would upon sale of the Pipeline enable the Authority to continue operating on a limited basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that following the sale the Authority would commence construction of the proposed ethane pipeline from Moomba to ICI's Port Botany petrochemical plant, which is to be upgraded to utilise a more suitable feedstock. The Authority would commence construction of the pipeline on a project management basis for a privately-owned entity. If it proceeds, this project is expected to have significant national benefits, because of potential for greater import replacement, increased exports of ethylene based products, and employment spinoffs stemming from the maintenance of employment levels at Port Botany and the jobs created in the construction phase. The design and planning of the ethane pipeline by the Authority and ICI has been underway for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority's involvement in the project is subject to it negotiating various conditions, including contractual arrangements which are acceptable to the government. The project has the broad support of the New South Wales Government. If the project proceeds, the Authority's role would be terminated when the relevant State Government environmental and planning approvals are obtained by the private sector owner. The Authority has secured necessary Commonwealth environmental and planning approvals for the project, which broadly mirror State requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the Authority be abolished, and part of its Act repealed as appropriate, following termination of its role in the ethane pipeline project and completion of any other post-sale responsibilities. Part 8 of the Bill provides for the Authority to be abolished on or before 31 December 1996. Should the ethane project not proceed, and the transfer of staff to Newco takes place on 30 June as planned, the Authority would be abolished upon finalisation of its residual business relating to Moomba-Sydney Pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority's operations post-sale will be funded by cash balances carried over, supplemented if necessary by short-term borrowings. The amendments to the Pipeline Authority Act provide for the Minister of Resources to exercise some discretion as to the appropriate size of the Board commensurate with the Authority's post-sale responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may appoint up to seven Board members and a minimum of three.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Authority's role following the sale, the bill includes a clause requiring TPA to operate in accordance with the responsible Minister's written determination of policies and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determinations by the Minister may cover the range of policies, responsibilities and obligations of the Authority, including those of a financial nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may issue more than one determination, and amend or revoke an existing determination as necessary. All determinations are to be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the Senate contains a range of legislative measures required to effect the sale of the Pipeline system on the basis I have described. The sale has attracted a good deal of international and domestic interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Short-listed competitive bidders were invited to undertake due diligence, and have participated in a program of site visits and presentations by the management of the Authority and relevant Commonwealth and State agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Final binding bids for the non-AGL 49 per cent stake in the Pipeline were received on 20 May, and the Government is considering the final sale package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, the Government plans to complete the sale by 30 June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill seeks to institute a sound legislative framework for the sale of specified assets and liabilities of the Pipeline Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a key element in assisting the Government to achieve its objectives for the sale.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is largely mechanical and the coalition will not be opposing it. The bill proposes an amendment to the Disability Services Act 1986, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. My interest in this bill relates to part 2, which amends the Disability Services Act 1986 by inserting a new subsection 23(5A). You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I was the shadow minister for community services until last week. I have been asked to keep alive the carriage of this matter and I am pleased to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will bring the legislation into line with what has developed as common practice over the years in relation to the issue of early notices of intent to recover moneys to the person potentially liable to pay compensation. Subsection 23(7) is also to be amended to require the insurer who has been sent a notice under subsection 23(5) advising of the debt due to the Commonwealth relating to the rehabilitation program provided to pay that debt before any payment is made to the client. Section 26 of the act is also being amended by the inclusion of a provision relating to section 27A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the effect of which is to require decision makers to notify their decisions to the people affected and to inform them of their review rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is responsible for the delivery of rehabilitation services to workers compensation authorities. These services account for 32 per cent of CRS service delivery and are revenue raising for the Commonwealth. The Disability Services Act 1986 does not allow for the CRS to claim payment for rehabilitation services prior to service delivery. In the past, CRS has encountered problems in attempting to recover moneys from workers compensation authorities after services have been rendered. As a result, this has often led to a cost recovery from CRS rehabilitation clients rather than from the relevant authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before the Senate today will overcome the past recovery difficulties and administrative delays by allowing CRS to claim funds from workers compensation authorities prior to service delivery for clients. The coalition supports this concept, as the outcome will be a step towards better accountability of government revenue. We are all aware that there are reviews currently under way of the CRS and certainly there does need to be a continuing emphasis on this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of government accountability has, of course, a familiar ring to it. In the new parliamentary sittings we have heard much about the need for greater accountability in relation to the spending of public moneys. There has already been a debate in the other chamber about the fraudulent use of funds expended in Department of Employment, Education and Training programs. These highlight the government's accountability problems. It is yet another demonstration of the government's inability to monitor programs and account for disbursement of funds. In the last parliamentary sittings it was the now famous sports rorts affair; in the spring sittings it will be a question of `watch this space' for the next example of extravagant waste of taxpayers' money by a government which has lost the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's white paper, released only a week or so ago, reveals that 1,850 new placements will be available for people with disabilities in 1994-95, rising to 2,300 placements four years later in 1997-98. Most of these placements will be available through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have grave concerns about the four-year program being able to assist people with disabilities into the work force through the CRS program. From the representations I have received in my office, I am concerned about the services provided by CRS to people with disabilities, particularly those who have high support needs. There should be a range of employment and training opportunities for people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, these programs should not necessarily be contained within the Commonwealth rehabilitation program and disability services program of the Department of Human Services and Health. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has many worthwhile programs and I am concerned that, given the proportion of people with disabilities as a percentage of the long-term unemployed, this has not been reflected as a percentage in new DEET training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the way in which this government is addressing employment and training opportunities for people with disabilities is just tokenism. This government is not seriously addressing the problems facing the single largest group of long-term unemployed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training figures obtained last year show a major disparity with new programs. For example, a total of 159,692 persons with disabilities were registered at CES offices located around Australia at the end of July 1993. Of this total, 96,263 people with disabilities, or 60 per cent, were registered for more that 12 months. A total of only 13,389 people with disabilities were participating in DEET training programs throughout Australia at the end of July 1993. These figures exclude approximately another 20,000 people with disabilities working in sheltered workshops and, more importantly, a total of 406,729 people in receipt of the disability support pension administered by the Department of Social Security at the end of June 1993. That is well over 500,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These stark figures speak for themselves and challenge us all. How will this government solve the unemployment and training problems facing people with disabilities with a mere 8,500 placements over the next four years? People with disabilities, their parents, carers and businesses have every right to be totally disillusioned with this government. The coalition supports the bill because it approves of proper financial administration and recoupment of government expenses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 amends several acts within the human services and health portfolio. The Australian Democrats have some concerns about part 2 of this bill, which amends the Disability Services Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the amendments enable early notice to be issued for the payment of the cost of a rehabilitation program provided by the Commonwealth. The practice of the Commonwealth has been to issue these notices either prior to settlement or at the conclusion of litigation. This amendment will ensure that the costs are considered part of the negotiations prior to settlement of a compensation claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the amendments require the person liable to pay the compensation to actually pay this debt to the Commonwealth first before the money is disbursed and paid to the injured person. We had some initial concerns about the impact of these provisions but, having talked to a range of individuals and organisations, we are satisfied that these amendments are justified. It is more appropriate from several perspectives for the Commonwealth to be getting its money prior to disbursement from a relevant liable authority rather than having to recover the money from rehabilitation clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is some need to monitor the operation of this provision. While I appreciate that it is a debt that has to be paid, the Commonwealth has an obligation to ensure that, where possible, firstly, its rehabilitation clients understand that they are incurring costs which will eventually have to come out of their settlement; and, secondly, that some consideration be given to the circumstances of clients when the Commonwealth is looking at the settlement being pursued. Here I take the opportunity to ask Senator Crowley what measures are in place to ensure ongoing monitoring of the operation of these particular amendments to the Disability Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the amendments provide for people making decisions under section 26 of the Disability Services Act to notify people affected by their decisions of exactly what those decisions are and what are the appeal rights for the individual. I know that some concern has been expressed in the past by service providers about their inability to get a clear picture of how or why decisions are being made under the Disability Services Act. I think this move, as well as improving the appeal rights of individuals, will assist in addressing the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act. These amendments follow on from last year's Child Care Rebate Act and are basically operational arrangements related to the commission's administration of the child-care cash rebate scheme. These amendments require the commission to prepare estimates of receipts and expenditure, to spend the money allocated to the scheme only in accordance with the approved expenditure estimates, to appropriate its assets appropriately, and to open the necessary bank accounts to handle its new function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already debated at length in this place the child-care cash rebate scheme. I do not want to take up a lot of the Senate's time today in going over it all again. However, I do want to reiterate a few points because I believe that the whole debate is in real danger of running off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, let me repeat that this debate should be about choice; about what action we can take to ensure that we can achieve a sensible balance between paid work, unpaid work, family responsibilities, leisure activities, and all those other things that people want to do with their lives. It is not simply about who should stay at home and care for the children. I firmly believe that in focusing on that issue the debate is moving us all backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it implies that married women are clogging up the work force and the sooner they get themselves out of the work force and back into the kitchen the better it will be for everybody. It also ignores the fact that&mdash;whether we like it or not&mdash;the reality is that not everybody lives in a nice, neat, happy family with husband and wife and 2.3 children. This is also a very crucial point because it fails to acknowledge that many workers have a whole range of other responsibilities beyond just caring for their children. For example, people in the work force may also be caring for an aged relative or an ill or disabled partner. Finally, it ignores the fact that workers, both men and women, have other interests and other responsibilities outside work and the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we focus exclusively on the issue of who stays at home and cares for the children, we are failing to really come to grips with the challenge of how we go about getting much more flexibility into the working lives and the working patterns of both men and women to give them some real choice about how they organise their work and their other responsibilities. Yes, it is about choice, but it must be a fair and genuine choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women, in or out of the work force, say that they do not want their choice to be between the two extremes: between working 40 hours a week, or full-time work, with children put in care full time and, on the other hand, staying at home full time with those children 24 hours a day. Most women&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;do not consider this to be a genuine or fair choice. They want something better than that. If they want to stay at home with their children, they want to be able to do that without incurring an enormous financial penalty. They do not want to be forced into the work force&mdash;particularly into a job that they do not especially like&mdash;just because the family cannot afford for them to stay at home. Similarly, women who want to work and who do not want to stay at home full time want to be able to do that without incurring enormous child-care costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those women quite rightly ask: why are child-care costs penalised more than other work related costs? That is the difference between the child-care cash rebate scheme and the home child-care allowance&mdash;a very obvious and fundamental difference that some male members of the coalition in particular do not seem to be able to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care cash rebate is a payment for work-related expenses. It is not appropriate for it to be means tested because no other work-related expense is treated in that way. Nothing else that is accepted as a work-related expense is means tested. The home child-care allowance is a direct payment made to the person who is staying at home to care for the children. While the Democrats believe that the current rate of that payment is grossly inadequate&mdash;indeed, in our budget submission, we called for it to be doubled&mdash;it should not be lined up for direct comparison with the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, as it stands, it is an insufficient amount in recognising the real economic value to this nation of that unpaid work. But it is not aimed at addressing that fundamental inequity between child-care costs and other non-means tested work-related expenses like cars, travel allowances, fax machines and education and training. I really think it is divisive to be running around the country, like Senator Minchin in particular, talking in very negative terms about working mothers, particularly those who use child care and who are entitled to some support for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time some of the women in the Liberal Party came out in this debate and talked about their experiences and started to make a constructive contribution to the debate. It is time that some people in the Liberal Party made it very clear what their specific policy is&mdash;do they want to see the removal of support for work-related child care? Many men and women want to see something in between the two extremes with which they are faced at the moment. I believe that the child-care cash rebate is a small way of moving in the right direction. The government is on the right path with both this scheme and the home child-care allowance. It is a small, perhaps best described as cautious, step down the right path, but as far as I am concerned, it is the right direction in which we should be heading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. The points made by Senator Tambling really go to the main concern with the disability legislation and the amendment to it. He alluded to the importance of the disabled having adequate access to employment, education and training and whether, under the white paper, there were sufficient training places for the disabled. The government's commitment to ensuring that the disabled are given the opportunity to take their place in the work force is well known, but I will certainly ensure that his comments are passed on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the query raised by Senator Lees, I am advised that measures are already in place to ensure that clients are made aware from the outset that they will incur a debt to the Commonwealth. I take the point that it is important that clients fully understand this point. With regard to the second query raised by Senator Lees about monitoring other matters, there is provision in the act for the debt to the Commonwealth by clients to be waived under special circumstances. So there is provision to take account of individual circumstances. I think the point about changing it is made with the best of intentions, but we can be reassured from the legislation that a process of monitoring is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the debate about the cash rebate and the home child-care allowance, Senator Lees made the point very well indeed. As I have said in many other places, it is like comparing apples and pears and I do not believe we are assisted at all by the contribution that Senator Minchin is making in this area. It will be very challenging, and I look forward to seeing the opposition's policies in this area and how Mr Downer comes to terms with the significant differences or disparity of views on assisting the women of Australia, and whether he will buy the argument put so forcefully by Senator Minchin and others that the place for women is at home in the unpaid work force and that if they stayed there, there would be no more unemployment. These are spurious arguments and it is disappointing&mdash;indeed, surprising&mdash;to find somebody like Senator Minchin actually using them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now dealing with the petroleum and offshore minerals legislation cognately. The coalition is opposed to the package of bills that seek to impose an annual user charge on all holders of offshore petroleum and mineral exploration permits, retention leases, production licences and pipeline licences. We are opposing outright three bills dealing with the imposition of these user charges&mdash;the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (User Charge) Bill 1994, the Offshore Minerals (Exploration Licence User Charge) Bill 1993 and the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence User Charge) Bill 1993. We are not opposing the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, but we have put forward an amendment to remove clauses 6, 9 and 11, which relate to the imposition of the user charges. I believe we have support for that amendment. We are not opposing the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Fees Bill 1994. Its provision to consolidate four previous acts dealing with fees into a single act is uncontroversial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reason for imposing a user charge on offshore exploration permit and leaseholders is to recover from industry approximately half the cost of geophysical work undertaken by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation through its continental margins program. As the continental margins program costs an annual $20 million to run, the government is looking to raise around $10 million from the offshore exploration industry through imposing a user charge on each offshore exploration or retention permit of around $100,000. The charges are set with a ceiling of $200,000 per permit or lease in the case of offshore petroleum exploration, and zero for the offshore minerals industry due to its presently undeveloped state. The petroleum industry would be hit with the full $10 million tax until the offshore minerals industry develops sufficiently to make a contribution, which will be a few years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is utterly opposed to this new tax grab by the government on the productive resources sector, levied at the extremely costly and uncertain stage of petroleum production exploration. If this government is remembered for anything, it will be for the endless capacity to devise legislation with seemingly the sole purpose of driving our industries offshore. Not content with putting mining investments on hold as a result of the uncertainty extended by the Mabo decision, the government now wants to place a major impost on offshore petroleum exploration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been increasingly difficult over the past few years to attract new investment to Australian industry. These new user charges, if passed, will only serve to provide a greater incentive for Australian exploration companies to divert their exploration funds overseas. These user charges will impact particularly heavily on smaller exploration companies, which often pave the way in frontier offshore exploration. Larger companies would be forced to re-evaluate their permits and leaseholdings in the light of their finite exploration funds being hit with this new tax. Surely it is a universal truth that companies will bear the weight of only so much taxation and other government charges before they look for more favourable business conditions elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association's Executive Director, Dick Wells, stated in the March edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Mining</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competition for companies' exploration dollars remains intensive in the Australian-Pacific region and worldwide. Fifteen Australian based companies have reported plans to spend up to $177 million overseas, $350 million on exploration and $714 million on development.</PARA>
<PARA>Both the petroleum and mineral sectors already pay hefty taxes&mdash;in the region of $2.5 billion for the mineral sector and $1.5 billion for the petroleum exploration and production sector. Now the government wants to weigh in with another tax to be borne by the petroleum industry and levied at the most expensive and uncertain stage of production, the exploration stage. Exploration is the most expensive and risky stage in the industry cycle, but also of huge importance to the continual search for new wells. For a typical exploration prospect in Australia an exploration well drilled onshore may cost up to $2 million, while a well drilled offshore could cost five times that amount. The bill for a wildcat exploration well drilled in a previously untested rock structure could run to $10 million or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An up-front user charge on an exploration permit can be absorbed in the same way as a tax, such rent resource, levied at the more certain and profitable production stage is absorbed. This being the case, exploration companies are absolutely the last industry that should be hit with increased taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National and Liberal parties are not opposed to work undertaken by the continental margins program and I will discuss that work in a moment. We recognise its public benefit as found in the Richards review but we totally repudiate the notion that the offshore petroleum and minerals industry be hit with these new charges in order to relieve the government of financing half the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received representations from the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association as well as other companies seeking support in opposing these bills that deal with the imposition of user charges. I have already stated opposition to these bills which can only act to impede growth in the vital resource area and that opposition is total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now briefly to discuss the continental margins program. The government's attempt to abrogate its funding responsibilities to this program is, after all, the reason for most of these bills that we are debating here today. The continental margins program which began operation in 1983 is a marine geological and geophysical research program to undertake strategic offshore surveys and research. The Australian Geological Survey Organisation&mdash;AGSO&mdash;formerly known as the Bureau of Mineral Resources, is responsible for administering the program and is based in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Essentially the continental margins program is a baseline study to define the basins and the margins of the continental mass. Land margins are not well delineated where the continental shelf drops off, as shown by the discovery three months ago of previously undetected land masses in south west Tasmania. This discovery extends the area that Australia can claim as our sovereign territory and has foreign affairs and treaty implications and should therefore be the responsibility of the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of south-west Tasmania, which I have just described, I do not suppose there will be any need for treaties and the like. However, this discovery adds to our sum total knowledge of our continent and therefore clearly has public benefit. A clear recognition of the public benefit provided by the continental margins program was contained in the government initiated Richards review of the administration arrangements of AGSO. One of the key recommendations of the Richards review handed down in May last year was that AGSO's work be recognised as pre-competitive, long term and of wide benefit and, as such, a public good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also revealed that the federal government is a major client of AGSO research, in particular the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The research work of AGSO through its continental margins program has a clear public benefit and, as such, should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill for the program should not be laid at the door of the offshore exploration petroleum and minerals industry. We strongly refute the resources minister's argument in his second reading speech on this package of bills when he proclaimed that despite the fact that the Richard's review decreed that geoscientific work undertaken by the continental margins program should be fully funded by the government, the government believed that where there are community benefits, the community should pay; where the industry benefits, the industry should pay; and where benefits are shared, costs should be shared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject utterly the notion that exploration companies benefit from the research undertaken by the continental margins program and, as such, should bear half the cost. In representations I have received, the exploration companies have all stated that the data collected by the continental margins program is not of a sufficiently high standard for their needs. It is not industry specific and it is of negligible value to them. This is highlighted by the fact that the continental margins program has generated only about $5 million worth of sales in six years when the program costs an annual $20 million to run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All exploration companies undertake their own costly exploration research and surveys which are designed specifically for their exploration needs. Quite rightly, these companies are baulking at being forced to pay for research that they do not need, want or use. The continental margins program annual running cost of $20 million does not represent a great drain on the federal coffers, particularly to support a program which has an established national benefit. However, $10 million is a great burden to place on an industry in a very uncertain exploration stage, which is so necessary for continued development but so costly and fraught with uncertain outcomes for the industry. As my colleague Peter McGauran stated in the other place, the wealth created by the petroleum and mineral industry underpins the quality of the Australian way of life in so many diverse areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government should be doing all it can to encourage industry, investment and exploration. Absolutely the last thing it should be doing is imposing ill-conceived new taxes that send completely the wrong signals to these wealth creating companies and will act to drive even more of them offshore. The coalition opposes these bills that seek to impose user charges on all offshore exploration permit holders and leaseholders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak for long, but I agree with my colleague Senator Boswell that this attempt by the government to impose charges on the petroleum exploration industry is a bad mistake. The continental margins program costs about $20 million per year and the government is seeking to raise $10 million of that from the offshore petroleum and development industry. User charges will be set at $100,000 per leaseholder in the petroleum industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continental margins program was begun by the government in 1983 and was aimed at providing mission oriented research into the structure, stratigraphy and evolution of Australia's continental margins. In 1992 the Bureau of Mineral Resources Advisory Board established an evaluation panel to receive submissions from industry and government on this work. The resultant report on AGSO and the continental margins program, prepared under the chairmanship of Dr Max Richards, Managing Director of Aberfoyle, and which also included Dr David Green, Professor of Earth Sciences at ANU, made an important recommendation. It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `public good' nature of AGSO's programs and outputs be recognised. ie pre-competitive, of wide benefit and long term in nature.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision by the government to impose these significant user charges is totally contrary to the recommendations of the Richards report and completely takes away the pre-competitive public good nature of the continental margins program. As far as is known, no other country in the world imposes user levies on companies to fund government research activities of this scale and nature. What is more, the industry does not use the information. The information is only of a general nature, mostly of relevance to the government. Over the last four years the industry has purchased only $1.1 million worth of information from AGSO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charges are nothing more than additional taxation on the industry. The levy will act as a barrier to new companies and a disincentive to current explorers. The industry is of the view that it currently contributes to these costs in any case by way of the $2.5 billion it pays in various taxes to governments each year. In addition, the industry spends well over $1.5 billion per year on exploration and development. I am particularly concerned about the small exploration companies, which will be most severely hit by this tax. A number of small Australian exploration companies have been trying to gain a foothold in the offshore exploration business. The additional charges for offshore permits will substantially increase the cost of exploration and may well put the offshore areas out of reach for smaller companies. Several small Australian exploration companies have contacted me on this matter expressing their very deep concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the example of one small Western Australian company which was recently awarded two offshore permits. It will have total forecast work program expenditure for the first three years of only $120,000, $750,000 and $240,000. The impost of an additional $100,000 on each of the permit areas will exceed the individual expenditures on the two permits in the first year and represents 25 to 30 per cent of the total expenditure in year two and 85 per cent of expenditures in year three. The extent of these charges will make it totally uneconomic for that small company to proceed. I cite the case of another company from my home state of Tasmania. Petracon Australia Pty Ltd has written to me expressing grave concern. It wanted to bid for exploration in offshore areas and looks like being frightened off from doing so because of this imposed charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really a silly proposal. The government should be trying to create an environment to encourage investment, not discourage it. Even the big companies have written to us expressing concern that this will tend to drive them offshore rather than investing here. The end result of this legislation can only be a reduction in offshore exploration. The results of that to the Australian community will be felt next century. We ought to be encouraging investment in Australia. It is the key to long-term economic growth. The opposition is totally opposed to these charges on the industry, and I support the amendments proposed by my colleague Senator Boswell. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also oppose this package of petroleum bills for reasons which, to some extent, parallel those raised by the opposition. I would like to raise some rather different issues, which are the primary reason for our opposition. Our preferred position would be that, as these bills have been put as a package, the government should be told to go away, rethink them and come back again. If the opposition chooses to try to dissect this integrated package and pass those bits which do not deal with the further imposition of a penalty on explorers to support AGSO, we will support that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would point out to the opposition that the amalgamations bill, which seeks to amalgamate a number of other charges, also seeks to replace those charges with a charge which will be set by regulation. Therefore the extent of that charge is not spelt out in this legislation, so there is a potential for a backdoor imposition of the fee which we are jointly choosing to knock out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the opposition that that is a potential danger, although I hope that when the regulations come in we will pick it up. I point out again that, as it would know, regulations have to be passed or dismissed in toto. We do not have the option of disaggregating the individual charges if they are presented in that way in the regulations. So there is the potential for a hole there in pursuing the path which the opposition has outlined. If that is the way it chooses to go, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, like many other countries in the world, has laid claim to the continental margin. It has entered into various international agreements relating to the 200 nautical mile zone. This, of course, places a responsibility on Australia to properly look after that area and, in looking after it, to manage it in ways which are consistent with the research work it carries out and with the data that comes from that research work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a responsibility which is placed on Australia as a nation. It has nothing whatsoever to do with whether in fact Australia chooses to explore that area for petroleum or for minerals or to research it in terms of fisheries resources or anything else. It is a fundamental database that Australia is required to establish under its international obligations in terms of good management of that zone. I simply reflect on the words of the Richards report, which clearly enunciated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review believes that the `public good' nature of AGSO's work should be clearly recognised and that AGSO should not be subjected to higher revenue and cost recovery targets. It is further proposed that AGSO be provided with additional resources&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not fewer resources, mark you, but additional resources, and clearly these are public resources&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to undertake emerging priority work and that rolling, triennial funding arrangements be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Richards committee, if anything, went somewhat further. That public good nature of the work carried out by AGSO has clearly been totally rejected by the government, and that is the sticking point as far as the Democrats are concerned. Of course, the work which AGSO carries out goes far beyond the work of exploring for petroleum or other minerals, and so it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second point that I want to stress. When research work becomes constrained by reason of the source of those funds, then the nature of the research work itself becomes distorted. To ask the continental margins program to become dependent 50 per cent upon funding from petroleum and mineral exploration&mdash;not mineral at this stage, but ultimately mineral exploration&mdash;would mean that the work in our continental margins would become directed primarily to that source; yet it should not be, it should be quite clearly directed to a much wider range of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when the continental margins program commenced in 1985 these were the requirements which were placed on that research work. The objective was to provide geo-scientific advice consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. Asking this body to obtain half its funds from an exploitative industry which by its very nature is not sustainable in the long term is simply totally inconsistent with the very objective for which AGSO was setting up the continental margins program. It goes on, consistent with this ecologically sustainable development program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;improve the efficiency and effectiveness in offshore petroleum and mineral exploration;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;support Government decision-making on offshore petroleum and mineral exploration and development;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;maximise and sustain Australia's legal continental shelf claim in preparation for the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;support inter-governmental negotiations between Australia and its nearest neighbours on the delineation of sea-bed boundaries; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;assist with resource and environmental advice in relation to marine parks and protected areas.</PARA>
<PARA>That, clearly, is a much wider brief than simply assisting by way of fee the petroleum and mineral exploration industry in our continental region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further danger in going down this road which has become very evident in recent days. There has been a great deal of debate in the last couple of days on the funding of the CSIRO divisions of agriculture and their dependence upon levies and other sources of private funding. Once people lock their research work into a requirement to get that funding, of course when that funding dries up&mdash;as it has in the case of agricultural science because of the downturn in many rural industries&mdash;and the government does not continue to support that research, the research work gets cut. This is precisely the time when we need more money to go into that research, not less. I see that Senator Panizza is nodding his head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to consider the situation in which half of our funding for the continental margins program comes from petroleum and mineral exploration. The imposition of this very hefty fee leads such people to disappear and, with them, may well disappear the very funding which we need for a proper continental margins research program. That, in itself, is a course which is fraught with great danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also invite honourable senators, if they did not see the program, to get hold of a copy of the SBS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dateline</EMPHASIS> program which was shown last Saturday night. It featured a young student doing an honours degree in science in Tasmania who researched the environmental consequences of the Mt Lyell mine and pollution of the Queen and King rivers in Tasmania. The point I want to stress is that the publication of that research work, which was passed by her supervisor, by the head of her department of environmental studies in Hobart, which was given a first-class honours degree, was then threatened by the Mt Lyell mine. I do not know whether the Mt Lyell mine in any way supports the University of Tasmania. If it does not, the situation is even worse, because for 16 months, evidently, according to that program, the university refused to publish that honours thesis, under threat from that private source. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much more likely is it that we will not see the publication of very important public information if it is funded directly from those private sources? It is another extremely powerful reason, I believe, why this public-good research work must be publicly funded, with the information it produces coming directly into the public domain and owned by the public. Of course, if the petroleum industry, after the information is available, chooses to buy some of that information, it is perfectly at liberty to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the previous speakers indicated that the petroleum industry bought $1.5 million worth last year. That is its right, but it is still public information, it remains public information, and anybody else can get access to it. That is the way it should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up and stress a point that has already been made: the size of these fees is sufficiently large as to discourage small Australian companies. It is possibly not likely to impact adversely on very large multinational companies which will come in and exploit our continental shelf. But in terms of smaller companies which may have only $200,000 to invest, these fees, which could run to $100,000 for a licence, would be a sufficient impediment and they simply would not explore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the question of whether we want this sort of exploration to go on under this sort of regime, I do not think we should be putting in place a regime which encourages large multinational companies to come and utilise Australian resources while at the same time discouraging smaller Australian companies from doing the same thing. It is for these reasons that the Democrats are opposed to this measure. We would prefer to throw out this whole package of bills and tell the government to go away and have another think about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the opposition to point out the possible dangers when amalgamation is dependent on the setting of the ultimate fee by way of regulation. If it thinks about the way regulations are allowed or disallowed in this place, it may reconsider its position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (User Charge) Bill 1994 and the other petroleum bills, I would firstly like to comment briefly on some of the comments made earlier in the debate. Senator Boswell said that there is public benefit to be gained from the project and that it should be fully funded by the government. That is an interesting statement coming from a member of the National Party. I will file it away and keep it for another occasion. If the Greens (WA) were convinced that there was public good involved with this project, we would certainly have no problems delineating it as such.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of elements to this proposal and I want to discuss a few of them. The user charge component of the bills is solely designed to fund the continental margins program, or CMP. This is a broad brush marine seismic program, the main objective of which is to identify prospective acreage to market to the offshore petroleum exploration industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people who might think this program is good for marine parks, I remind them of the thinking that says, `How can we know how to declare a national park until we know what is underneath it?' Basically, this program is trying to find out what areas will not be allowed to be called a marine park. That has nothing at all to do with environmental qualities; it has to do with finding out what areas have no possible commercial value in the future. In fact, in some ways it works against conserving the marine environment for its ecological components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need and capacity for the program to fulfil the common good functions of, firstly, defining the limits of Australia's legal continental shelf and, secondly, collecting environmental baseline data are highly questionable. The program currently costs around $20 million per year, using a vessel fitted largely for seismic survey work. The user charge aspect of the legislation is designed to put into effect a government decision that the industry should contribute half the cost directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individual companies and APEA have put the view to us that the program is of little value to the industry and that the industry has far greater capability for strategic geological modelling than the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, AGSO. Apparently, the users do not want to use the facility, at least not with a cost component in addition to what they are paying for specific data. AGSO have countered by producing an analysis which shows that sales to the industry have increased markedly since 1991-92 and may reach around $6 million in 1993-94. However, this figure represents a cost recovery of only 27 per cent annually. An organisation representing small exploration concerns in Western Australia has made representations to us indicating that it feels that this program would damage the small concerns more than it would the bigger exploration companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear to us why seismic techniques are necessary to delineate the shelf edge. The navy's hydrographic survey team seems to be capable of doing the work along with the CSIRO's oceanographic vessel RV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Franklin</EMPHASIS>. In addition, we have concerns about the poorly defined environmental survey functions of the CMP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our inquiries indicate that the vessel in question is not equipped for this sort of work and that there has been little or no liaison with the CSIRO Division of Oceanography, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, or any other marine science body in order to develop a cooperative sampling program that would be of any national significance. Under the circumstances, any so-called environmental work which did take place would be scientifically inadequate, irrelevant or a duplication of existing programs. Our CSIRO oceanographic facilities are presently underutilised, and we submit that taxpayers' money might be better utilised in making more efficient use of our existing marine research capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose the so-called user charges provisions of these bills because they are, in effect, industry subsidies which the industry itself says it does not need. We do so on the assumption, based on advice provided to us, that in the absence of user charges the CMP program will be terminated. We believe that the program must be of far greater import to Australia's marine research effort to be supported by the taxpayer. Anything of commercial value to the exploration industry would be supported by the industry&mdash;and appropriately so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to bear in mind that the vessel in question is contracted until 1997, and the government may be exposed to a bill of $12 million to $15 million in decommissioning and retirement costs as a consequence. However, we believe that the program has insufficient value for it to continue on the basis of its contribution to the so-called common good. </PARA>

Senator Coulter's purist view is that the government should fund research and that industry should not have any influence or any particular say in how that research is carried out&mdash;even when it is relevant to that industry's particular needs. Based on Senator Coulter's purist position, the petroleum industry has managed to convince him that it should not pay one cent towards the cost of a $20 million program which must be, to some extent, worthwhile and of some value to the petroleum industry.

We are faced with a program that is costing $20 million on the budget, scarce government resources and the petroleum industry says, `We don't want the program.' We may well have to call the industry's bluff, and that would be very unfortunate because there are two aspects to this $20 million program: it has been adjudicated that 50 per cent, half the cost of the program, is beneficial to the offshore petroleum industry; and the other half has substantial community benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the cost of the program is such, particularly with the leasing of the vessel, that for the program to be sustainable it has to be funded at around a minimum of $20 million. In order for the program to be sustainable or cost effective, the funding cannot really be reduced below that figure. So if the industry takes out its $10 million worth and says, `We're not going to pay one cent'&mdash;not one cent towards the cost of geological information in this country, which we are trying to make it pay&mdash;how will the other $10 million community benefit be funded? The fact is we cannot fund it, or it will be a struggle to fund it.

<PARA>The purpose of the amendment is to refer this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for inquiry and report on or before 20 June 1994. The reason for this is that a number of issues need to be looked at. It is extremely difficult to sort out the level of use value and we need to look at the implications of this decision for the industry and also for AGSO.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill, which makes a number of adjustments to existing legislation. Indeed, it repeals several acts that have now achieved their purposes and no longer have any practical effect. So there is a tidying-up aspect to the legislation and some other changes which take into account debates in the chamber and we in the opposition do not oppose this bill, nor have we any amendment to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome, even if only for a few minutes, the opportunity to make some observations, not only about the legislation before us but also about some aspects of higher education. The bill repeals three funding acts; from 1976, 1987 and 1989. The parliament has before it two times a year, through new legislation, the mechanism for funding higher education around Australia. When, by the lapse of time, those measures have all been fulfilled, by and large those twice-a-year bills expire and are no longer relevant. This legislation will repeal entirely the three acts I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes some changes to the Maritime College Act. The Maritime College is an important institution in Tasmania. The legislation provides that the chairperson of the academic board of the college automatically will be a member of the college's council. It also has some drafting changes to remove gender specific terms. All these changes are acceptable to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes adjustment to maximum levels of funding for higher education institutions in this triennium; that is, for 1994, 1995 and 1996. Inflation is running at about 2 1/2 per cent, but even with this happily low nominal level of inflation there are periodic adjustments to achieve in real terms what was intended in any disbursement of moneys to higher education. We are constantly having top ups to achieve the intended level of funding for our institutions. This is the case here. The amounts are not very large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aspects is that, as a result of this legislation, Commonwealth funding for the Institute of the Arts at the Australian National University will no longer pass through the ACT government. It will now flow directly from the Commonwealth government to the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes in this legislation are amendments that make legislation consistent with the Senate's rejection last year of the then government proposal to introduce double higher education contribution scheme charges for those doing second undergraduate degrees. The Liberal and National parties opposed this attempt to put a burden on Australia's students and to cheat the students of Australia with a burden which was never discussed prior to the election and which was, in fact, contrary to the bland warm feelings put to students by the Labor Party before the election. Accordingly, and for the reason that this was an unjustifiable burden upon those students in any event, and because it was very difficult to make some distinctions as to who were taking second degrees, the Liberal and National parties&mdash;I am proud it was on my motion&mdash;knocked that government policy over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats, I see, had exactly the same view. It was another instance of what must be now 20, 30, 50 amendments that have been put up in these last dozen years that have shown the Senate at its best, where we have exhibited the arguments that have led to the majority of representatives in the Senate amending government measures. The government has fully accepted that outcome. I hope it is repenting and making proper apologies to the students of Australia. Having listened carefully to the debate in the Senate, and as a result of its decision, it is necessary to make some changes to the legislation. Of course we support those changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) notes that advice from the Attorney-General's Department gives assurance that this method of slotting these financial changes into this bill, rather than waiting for a higher education funding amendment bill, is legally valid. A question had arisen in some of our minds as to whether or not this legislation was in a form that was acceptable to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and was appropriate legislative practice. Accordingly, I ask the duty minister, Senator Cook, and his advisers whether I may see a tabled copy of the Attorney-General's advice about the validity of this legislative approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to refer to criticisms currently being made of the way higher education policy is being directed by the Labor government. Professor Don McNicol, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, has urged&mdash;and I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report of 9 March as one example of his urging&mdash;that universities be allowed to have full-fee paying students in addition to government funded places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to this plea from the chairman of the most important advisory body on higher education, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee because those are views that I have been putting in the Senate for many years now&mdash;that we keep and increase the taxpayer funded places in higher education around Australia but, in addition, open a new door altogether to allow fee-paying students to also enrol, and to do that on a most responsible basis, not as some thin edge of the wedge to undermine the government's provision of the places that are currently provided. I want to give recognition to the universities which are calling for that kind of flexibility. The government has already conceded in the last few years the ability for this to happen with postgraduate students, particularly in very applied courses that are of service to a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for industry, Senator Cook, fully understands that Australian industry needs very skilled people. We are involved in continuous education, and people with particular skills at age 30, 35 or 40 may well gain from a six or a 12 months course that will suit them to extend their skills, to adapt their skills to the needs of that particular industry. Often the best place for the provision of that skill will be at an established university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the old rule of three years ago that there was no flexibility for specially designed, fee-paying, postgraduate courses, diplomas and so on, was not on. The government has actually bent to that and accepted the principle that the opposition has been arguing for all these years with regard to those students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the parallel plea, quoting the Australian Vice-chancellor's Committee again, that there be that kind of flexibility with regard to a wider range of courses in Australia. We ought not to have some ideological hang up, some bar in the Labor Party's approach to this matter to rule out fee-paying enrolments at universities. I say again: this should not be done at the expense of any of the places that are provided on the HECS basis and not as a thin edge to any wedge that would see a decrease in the number of such places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to my good friend, the person who above all I have respected these last 20 years, for making a contribution to higher education, and that is Professor Karmel. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 29 April he has again attacked the approach that has been forced on higher education from the time that Mr Dawkins was a minister in the Labor government. I continue to listen to Peter Karmel. He is above politics. He is arguing on the merits as he sees them&mdash;it is his experience&mdash;and as a person who has contributed in the greatest way not only to higher education but also to education in schools over these 20 years. He is standing aloof and criticising the broad centralist intrusion that has especially flowed since 1987 when then Minister Dawkins become Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of straitjackets, the kinds of centralising interventions by the Commonwealth not only are not acceptable to the Liberal and National parties but are not acceptable to independent experienced observers such as Peter Karmel. I have already referred to this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. Given that I want to be brief, I will not quote further from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with my third and final point. The vice-chancellors of Australia continue to criticise this Labor government for taxing postgraduate scholarships in a new way. I have hopes that the government will actually listen to these criticisms and make it possible that the postgraduate students of Australia will not suffer as a consequence of a new tax ruling. This relates to a scholarship given by a particular institution to a postgraduate student who is undertaking some service to the university. There has been a tax ruling that some element of the scholarship, if not all of it, is in fact of an income form rather than a scholarship form. There is an implication under the tax ruling that the scholarship in the hands of the postgraduate student would be taxable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I like to think, when I have my warmest thoughts about my colleagues sitting opposite, that they would not wish this to be the outcome for the postgraduate students. We do not want to see a hurt, a harm, a new barrier placed in the way of good postgraduate outcomes in a wide variety of fields around our universities. Because this affects the scholarships given by the institutions themselves it is no surprise that the heads of those institutions, the vice-chancellors, are therefore putting the plea on behalf of their own awardees, that is, these postgraduate students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred to this in Estimates Committee E last Friday and I am hoping that the assurances that this matter will be investigated and solved will be soon announced by the government. With these remarks, I note again that the opposition will not be opposing, nor will there be any amendments to, this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Teague has already indicated, the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill makes minor amendments to education and training legislation. The Australian Democrats will not be opposing those changes: in fact, we welcome them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to comment on the changes to higher education policy as a consequence of this year's budget. The Democrats are pleased to see that this bill allows for funding adjustments to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 as a consequence of the rejection of double HECS for second degrees by the Senate last year. As Senator Teague has mentioned, that was a little moment of high success for the Senate, because we were doing what I think the Senate was intended to do, review legislation and protect certain aspects of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we saw it, and I think rightly so, the government was attempting to introduce a regressive fee payment. It was not the only regressive fee payment that the government attempted to introduce last year. It also tried to implement a minimum time in which students had to complete their degrees or else face a 50 per cent increase in their HECS debt for each additional unit that they undertook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague has invoked the Australian Vice-chancellors Committee already in his speech, I remind the Senate that it was that body that pointed out the educational fallacy of such a move. Again, I am pleased that the Senate was able to recognise also how wrong such a move was and to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum time rule was excised from the relevant legislation and the double HECS proposal was stopped by the Senate after strong lobbying and protests&mdash;and I must proudly say that that was led by the Democrats&mdash;by student and other organisations and, eventually, the opposition, after some internal policy processing and some individual efforts. The Democrats take pride in this result. We were pleased when the opposition did come on side and oppose what was a cynical revenue raising move. Unfortunately, I think we can demonstrate that the Democrats remain the only supporters of an accessible and equitable education system for all Australians regardless of their background, their socio-economic status or their sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's budget has been described by some in the education sector as a mogadon budget. Senator Cheryl Kernot has stated that it is one of the most boring budgets that we have seen. But there are some discrete budget changes that will impact harshly on students. We should be aware of those changes and note them. They include the decision to calculate HECS repayments on a pro rate basis and an increase to the amount that students can take out in the form of a loan. Those changes in this budget mean that from 1995 all new graduates will have to pay HECS on a pro rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Pro rata basis' is a pretty easy thing to say. It almost sounds fair until one examines how it will actually work and what it will mean for individual students. Now, after this budget, graduates are liable to repay their HECS deferred payments even if they have only worked for part of the year. According to the government, students will be required to repay their HECS debt in accordance with the proportion of the year that they spend in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats, education groups and individuals are particularly concerned for those students who work on a part-time basis or on a casual basis. It is easy to see why. Take the example of somebody who gains part-time work for a couple of weeks at a rate which is in excess of the $26,000-odd threshold. It is quite likely that somebody studying for an engineering degree will be fortunate enough&mdash;and there are many who are not&mdash;to gain part-time work either as a work experience component required by the engineering faculty or on a particular project at a rate in excess of the $26,000 threshold. The total amount received for a few weeks may well be just a couple of thousand dollars, and it may be the only work that is obtained during the whole year, yet out of that couple of thousand dollars will be taken the HECS repayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous scheme was fairer when the total annual earnings of the student were taken into account and if those earnings were below that threshold, the HECS repayment was not required at that time. That was the original intention, and it seemed much fairer. But now, even if a student is able to obtain employment earning only a measly few hundred or couple of thousand dollars, that HECS repayment will be taken out on this pro rata basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to these pro rata arrangements and along with changes to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which allow the inclusion of HECS assessment debts in the PAYE arrangements, the government expects to recoup almost $12 million in 1994-95, $3 million in 1995-96 and $2 million in 1996-97. The Democrats find it interesting that the coalition has taken offence to these amendments, despite its earlier support for the changes contained in the Higher Education Funding Act in relation to the PAYE scheme. I think that is an inconsistency, if not an hypocrisy. We will be dealing with that later. I think the important thing is that, all in all, students are now repaying their HECS debts at a faster rate, and sooner. All that means is that these students are all the poorer for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned in my speech on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill in this chamber only three weeks ago, the threshold levels for the repayment of HECS and now for student loans have been lowered. No longer is the CPI factored into the threshold for average weekly earnings. Again that is an unjust move which does not apply to other measures. When we are talking fairness, the CPI is one of those basic fairnesses that should be included in all projections for either repayments or the receipt of benefits. Any movements in the CPI should be contained as a basic premise on which such calculations are built. It is not here, and that illustrates the unfairness with which students are treated by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HECS and student loan repayments are now concentrated at an earlier age for nearly all graduates. The National Union of Students, the peak representative body for students in Australia, claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As repayments become larger and more rapid they will ultimately deter potential students from entering education.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a worrying trend in higher education; one that points to a government that is committed to reducing education quality and funding. That is what it is doing, and it is evident by its actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to increase the amount that students can take out in student loans from $6,000 to $7,000 per year signals the government's increasing reliance on user pays education and student assistance, and that is at the expense of a realistic and increased commitment to student assistance. When the loans scheme was being hotly debated in 1992, when student groups claimed that it was the thin end of the wedge and that the amount available for loans would increase over the years, they were howled down by the government. The government claimed that this was a fallacious argument. I think the students' accuracy has been proven by what we see before us now. It cannot be denied; it is there in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to research by the National Union of Students, graduates who take up the student loan option will, upon graduation, have a debt of at least $21,000 which does not even begin to take into account the HECS debt. Most students will be given a graduation present of around $30,000 worth of debt. We have already demonstrated that that will impact mostly on women who are unable to gain employment at a rate which is sufficient to be able to repay that, and other socioeconomically disadvantaged students who may carry that debt for the rest of their lives. And what does this government do? It simply reduces the threshold at which repayment is mandatory and it increases the rate at which repayment is required. How can this government claim that it is not condemning Australian students to debt? I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had the opportunity to do something about this situation in this budget, but it ignored even the recommendations from its own commissioned research by the Boston consultancy groups and the recent Senate standing committee report into research in higher education which suggested that there is a desperate need for a research infrastructure funding injection of at least $125 million for a year, and we saw nothing of that in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other changes contained in this bill transfer the responsibility of funding for the Australian National University to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and consequently deduct the necessary amount from the ACT government. As has already been mentioned, that is a more efficient way of doing it. Other changes also amend the Maritime College Act 1978 to allow for the appointment of the chairperson of the academic board and to include changes to gender specific terms&mdash;welcome changes, but minor. Three acts are repealed as a consequence of this legislation as they have been superseded by other laws, and of course we have no disagreement with that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Teague and some of the comments of Senator Bell on the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. I will go into what I agree with and what I disagree with in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will do four things, but I will concentrate mainly on one. Three things it will do is change the Maritime College Act, transfer funds from the Canberra Institute of Arts to the ANU, and repeal other acts relating to employment, education and training and related purposes, all of which I have no problem with. However, I do have some problems with what is happening as a result of an outfall from a move in this Senate to stop this government doubling the rate of HECS. We now have before us the financial consequences of that, and how the government has reacted to those consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back to what happened, the government&mdash;despite its election promises at the last election when its members went around the countryside bagging us and our policy&mdash;within a 12-month period tried to bring in the doubling of one particular payment, the HECS payment. I cannot remember&mdash;and I do not think Senator Teague or Senator Bell can remember&mdash;the ALP saying anything about this at the last election. I cannot remember ALP members trumpeting this around campuses. But just as they told lies throughout the whole election campaign about most of our policies and about what they had up their sleeves in their own policies, we had a very rude shock following the election when we learned they were going to double HECS. At no time did we ever propose to do that. Obviously we opposed such a measure in the earlier legislation, which was supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely amazing that this government, which is supposed to be committed to the principles of access and equity, would propose to double HECS in the first place. The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training was quite alarmed by what the government was doing and produced a unanimous report stating that this should not happen. The matter was debated in the Senate and, with the support of the Democrats, the government was defeated on that measure which was inequitable and certainly would have created huge access problems for some of the most disadvantaged groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of these groups. There were women who needed to upgrade their training after an absence from the work force, usually for family reasons. Many of these people have been away from work for quite some time. Often, the jobs that they did before do not exist. They needed to retrain and, even though they might have a first qualification, it might have been in the wrong field, it might have been too general, or they might have needed something more specific. Many of these people were not very well-off; a doubling of HECS would have been devastating for them and they would have dropped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were people who were currently completing additional training. I had calls from quite a number of the universities regarding people doing course-work for degrees such as a master of education. These were teachers who were trying to get a better education, to place themselves better in the more competitive race for positions in schools. One of the deans in Victoria said, `We are going to lose half to three-quarters of our people if you let this double HECS go through.' That group is particularly grateful that such a measure did not eventuate. Migrants are another group who are desperately in need of greater training to compete in the workplace. That group was going to be affected as well. The stopping of this bill was a very good thing from the point of view of all of those groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government is claiming an extra cost on the budget, and it is outlined in the statement that it will have to increase outlays by $27 million, that figure was based on the original proposal to have a double HECS. The government would have had to find the money, anyway, without the double HECS. The double HECS is an inequitable measure which should not have been there in the first place. Fairly obviously, we are not really talking about additional expenditure; it would have been needed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem with what the government is doing with HECS now that it has not achieved a double HECS. They have fiddled with it to some extent to allow for a change in repayment arrangements that will make it harder for students. The basic reason for this is that the Department of Finance is seeing all of this unpaid HECS debt. We have set up with HECS a very generous scheme&mdash;a scheme that is seen worldwide as a leader in this field. Through the tax system, people have the opportunity over some period to repay their HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports that sort of approach and it is widely popular in the community. Therefore, we are a little dismayed that the government is interfering with this basically to increase its revenues in the short term. It is trying, by fiddling around the edges of this arrangement, to claw more back from students over a shorter period. That, of course, will create additional hardship for students. We are not talking about a large amount of money at this stage. One would have thought, within a $4 billion budget for education and a $100 billion-plus budget overall, the government could have found savings in other sectors rather than hitting these groups of students. I have already pointed out that these students are some of the poorest in the community and therefore in need of greater funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadowed earlier that I would be disagreeing with some of the things Senator Bell said in relation to the provision of support for students. One point on which I will disagree with him relates to the provision for student loans. He seemed to be saying, if I picked up his comments correctly, that there needed to be realistic increases in support for students, but funded from the budget. I challenge Senator Bell to say where those things should really come from. Our Senate committee has conducted major inquiries into the area of educational research. What it uncovered was a university system that, because of lack of funding support, is on the verge of breakdown in a number of areas, such as infrastructure, the research area, teaching loads and library and electronic support systems. I wonder which areas of the budget Senator Bell thinks should be cut to pay for these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A better approach&mdash;the one which the government is increasingly developing&mdash;is through the provision of student loans. This is based on the Chapman report. What is happening is that the limits are going up so that students can borrow more. They can repay it through the tax system in a HECS-style arrangement. It gives students from a wide range of backgrounds and financial circumstances a better opportunity to go to university and gain an extra qualification. We applaud that sort of measure. I am surprised that the Democrats are not supporting a measure which will allow students to have greater access to funding and greater flexibility in the funding arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the coalition supports the main provisions of this bill, but we do express concern about a number of things that have been raised&mdash;the penny-pinching way in which the government is creating for itself extra funding through its variations on the HECS measures. I acknowledge again the great victory in this chamber in calling the government to account for its election promises and for establishing that it did not indicate at the election that it was going to double HECS. It has been prevented from doing this by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to join this debate for a number of reasons. I take the opportunity to commend my colleagues Senator Teague and Senator Tierney for the leadership they have shown not only in this matter, in fighting for the interests of students, but in the education debate generally over a long period. Both, of course, have come from periods of professional work within tertiary institutions and have carried through that interest in practical ways within the parliament. I think it is important to put on the record the continuing role they are playing which the coalition certainly appreciates, as should the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also join with them in condemning the government for a foolish attempt to provide a further disincentive to education. The scheme that was proposed by the government to double HECS&mdash;the double fee on students seeking a second degree&mdash;was, in our view, as we said at the time, punitive and unfair. It disadvantaged not only women, but the disabled who needed to retrain to enter the work force, and migrants who needed to upgrade their qualifications&mdash;in many ways people who were more disadvantaged than the average in our community. Why a labor party would seek to impose such a disincentive one can only wonder, but it is not in the national interest. What this country needs is more and better education, not less. I think the Senate's role in defeating the government's attempt to impose this disincentive is one that should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to use this occasion to make a couple of general comments on the state of higher education, having shadow responsibility in this portfolio. I am particularly disturbed at the effects that reduced funding over the term of the Labor government on a per capita student basis has had on our tertiary institutions and their capital infrastructure, such as high-tech equipment, libraries, modern information technology systems&mdash;in fact, all that is essential for the efficient running of any institution but particularly an educational institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Senate to note some comments made by those who know about this. On 13 April this year, Professor McNicol, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, said of that institution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think we're pretty close to the wire now. I need $30 million a year just to get the buildings up to scratch.</PARA>
<PARA>At about the same time, Professor Yerbury of Macquarie University said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had very little money for capital works. Our universities have been so starved of funds for more than a decade that the size of the task of bringing them up to scratch is colossal.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just to bring them up to scratch, not further improve them. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee raised the matter I mentioned a moment ago about the effect on libraries and other infrastructure. On 25 March it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the inadequate level of support that has been provided in the past, universities have experienced a serious run-down in their facilities, particularly in the area of major equipment, library holdings and in the provision of modern information technology systems.</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to understand why this Labor government has so neglected our tertiary institutions. Even it should recognise that they are critical to a prosperous Australia. On 6 May Professor McNicol said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last decade the teaching and research infrastructure of Australian universities has been considerably weakened as universities have accomplished important and substantial changes to their direction and operation with increasingly limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA>It is highly disturbing that someone as respected as Professor McNicol would be talking about a considerable weakening of our teaching and research infrastructure. That is something for which this government should be condemned. Many of our leading academics have been voicing this concern. Unfortunately, the government has remained deaf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last comment I shall mention was made by Professor Charles Oxnard of the University of Western Australia, who was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 May as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The country's leading doctoral degree-granting universities are slipping into mediocrity. The best individuals at the present time are not willing to settle for the life of genteel poverty and second-rate thinking that is now being forced upon the graduate universities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is highly disturbing. It is about time this government addressed that issue of the decline in infrastructure. While it is doing that, it also needs to address the fact that, even though the recession had the effect of encouraging students to continue with education, our participation rate, which has risen, is still less than that of many of our competitors. It is still lower than countries such as the United States of America and Canada. I am one of those who believes that qualified students should be able to maximise their potential through the best available education. Obviously, that is not being received courtesy of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to 1992, under this government's policies in the range of 34,000 to 50,000 students could not even gain a place at university. The following year, between 29,000 and 43,000 could not gain a place. We on this side of the chamber believe that that is an appalling situation and that the failure of the government to address it is something for which it should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to raise a matter that I intend to pursue further&mdash;the low level of students in this country undertaking courses such as engineering, which I think will be vitally important in a highly competitive region. It is interesting and disturbing to note that the number of engineering students in Australia is only 5.3 per cent of total student enrolments compared with an OECD mean of 12.1 per cent. So the level of enrolment is less than half that of the OECD figure. I think we will suffer in the years ahead unless something is done to address that inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to continuing the education debate in the months ahead and to pressing this government, during the time it remains in office, to do better. I also look forward to developing policies that the Australian people, I am sure, will find more attractive at the next election. The immediate issue, however, is this bill, which arose from the government's foolish attempt to impose double HECS. The Senate should be commended for bringing that to an end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 principally deals with the reintroduction of a register of operations on the waterfront. In the view of the coalition, that is an enormous step backwards. Informed commentators have described it as going back to where we were with the waterfront in 1967&mdash;back to the bad old days&mdash;with the obvious movement back to pooling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going back to the syndrome that a job on the waterfront was a job for life, a syndrome that existed on our waterfront for years and years. In recent years we have seen very significant changes. We have moved from the pooling of industry employment to enterprise employment. The whole thrust of these amendments is to conform with yet another international convention in an attempt to tie domestic policy in this country to international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that this particular convention does not apply to the situation that exists in Australia. In fact, it is concerned with the old system that previously existed in this country. It is beyond belief that the government is moving down this particular track, particularly after we spent some $430 million to get out of the previous system. It raises many questions as to why the government is going down this track. It also raises the question of what Senator Collins&mdash;who was involved in the waterfront reform process and made many claims in this Senate and elsewhere&mdash;thinks about what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recapping what has happened. Under the waterfront reform process some 4,500 employees on the waterfront were retired. They received an average redundancy payment of slightly over $100,000, plus superannuation and other benefits. The restructuring of the waterfront has not come at insignificant cost; in fact, it has been achieved at huge cost. It is incredible to think that we would want to go back and put in place a system that would allow a return to the previous situation on the waterfront. The $430 million has been paid by all Australians through taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the other side of the equation. Recently we have seen how, under the current government, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. There is no doubt that those who are left on the waterfront fit fairly and squarely into the category of those who have got richer. We find that those people have had a 23 per cent increase in their take-home pay; they are sitting on salaries between $92,000 and $94,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to refer to some aspects of the ILO convention. The convention is being used as an excuse. This convention concerns the social repercussions of new methods of cargo handling at docks. It has nothing to do with the restructuring of the enterprise agreement system which is now working in Australia. The convention deals with the situation where pooling still exists around the world. I believe that the government is using this convention to kowtow to the maritime unions. It would be interesting to know why this is happening. How much money did the maritime unions put into the last election campaign on behalf of the government? There has to be a fundamental reason for this turnaround. Senator Collins has been very involved in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waterfront reform was about making Australia internationally competitive, and we have come some way down the track. We improved during the reform period, but we still have a long way to go. In recent times we have been going backwards in our performance on the waterfront. I will quote a few figures. In Sydney, for example, crane loading rates for TEU containers dropped from 19.95 per hour to 13.8 per hour, and in Melbourne it dropped from 26.75 per hour to 18.8 per hour. That raises a question as to why Melbourne is performing so much better than Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare these figures with those of our near neighbours, New Zealand, we see that New Zealand has an average TEU movement of some 30 containers per hour. We are moving about 20 to 22 containers at our best times; New Zealand can get 10 more per hour than us. That is why I say that we still have a long way to go. When we look at the opportunity for exports from Australia compared with the volume of exports from New Zealand, Australia should be performing at least as well as or better than New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about the reintroduction of the register. Where does that leave us? If it succeeds it would almost certainly lead us back in time to pooling. It would lead us back to the jobs for life syndrome. It would remove the competitive element that has been introduced onto the waterfront. This would occur despite the fact that we have paid $430 million to get rid of that syndrome and move towards becoming competitive. I have already mentioned the enormous increase in wages for those who are left on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for the process to be allowed to develop further and put Australia first in terms of our export performance. This has been highlighted very succinctly in the last couple of days by the blowout in our current account. We see the crucial importance of getting on top of our spiralling burden of debt. Inevitably, that spiral of debt is going to lead to higher and higher interest rates. The impact on financial markets in this country over the next one, two, three, or even 10 years is going to be significant. We can do something about this by improving our performance on the waterfront, not by turning the clock back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An expensive strike occurred in February this year, and we have to ask whether part of the terms of settlement of that strike included an agreement to bring this legislation back. That is an important and valid question. I would like the minister to answer that question when he comes to the table. There must be better reasons than just saying that we have to conform with convention 137. There have to be reasons why the government would not have policy positions which further enhance industry employment. There have to be reasons why the government wants to go down a path that has the potential to destroy enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent months we have heard what the Prime Minister has said. We also heard what Mr Brereton said with regard to enterprise agreements when the Industrial Relations Reform Act went through the other place prior to Christmas. We also heard what the minister in this place had to say. There has to be some agenda that this parliament and the Australian public have not been told about with regard to this legislation. If there were no agenda, we would not have this legislation before us: it is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the statements that have been made by and some of the letters that have passed between various people involved in this matter. I refer to a letter, back in 1992, from Peter Evans of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority to stevedoring employers. The first paragraph of that letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has given in principle approval to a proposal to fund the exit of surplus labour remaining in the stevedoring industry following the implementation of enterprise agreements under the In-Principle Agreement. The proposal includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the termination of the transitional arrangements under the IPA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the exit of eligible employees sufficient to eliminate the surplus labour</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the rescission of industry based employment arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above would complete the move to full enterprise employment under the In Principle Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Why has the government moved to change its position? Further, I have a letter from the then Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Cook. In this letter dated 8 September 1992, I think&mdash;it is a little hard to read&mdash;the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government expects the industry parties to complete the move to full enterprise employment, including the rescission of the 1977 General Agreement and other industry-based employment arrangements, before the end of the reform program in October this year.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it begs the question: in view of the statements the government made at that time, correctly, on the direction in which we need to go on the waterfront, why does it want to return to a register?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with article 4 of the convention and sum up the reasons why there should be no register. Firstly, the legislation reintroduces industry-wide arrangements to a sector which has already paid $420 million to remove those arrangements. Secondly, it is based on an ILO convention which, by any measure, is totally irrelevant to stevedoring in Australia in 1994. Thirdly, it is contrary to the government's requirements, as stated in those 1992 letters I quoted, that all industry-based arrangements had to be rescinded by 31 October 1992. Fourthly, it leaves the way open for the MUA to require continuation of a register beyond the sunset provisions of this bill. Fifthly, it leaves the way open for a union to demand application of other sections of article 4 of the convention. Article 4 states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The strength of the registers shall be periodically reviewed so as to achieve levels adopted to the needs of the port.</PARA>
<PARA>If we have enterprise arrangements, surely it is the responsibility of the enterprises organising those arrangements, not the responsibility of the government, to create a register to lead back to pooling. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Any necessary reduction in the strength of a register shall be accompanied by measures designed to prevent or minimise detrimental effects on dockworkers.</PARA>
<PARA>In this country we have already dealt with that to the tune of $400-odd million. Sixthly, the present debate concerning government intentions to reintroduce registers to be made by the SIC, combined with the statements by Mr Evans and Mr Deputy President Williams, constitute the ingredients of a cocktail which, if swallowed, has the potential to take the industry back to 1967, that is, re-establish registers and re-introduce port pools to take care of surplus labour. That flies absolutely and totally in the face of what has occurred over recent years. Finally, it is unnecessary, because employers in the stevedoring sector, like others in the community, maintain employee records under the Industrial Relations Act. Why should the MUA be any different?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee stage, I will be moving a number of amendments on behalf of the opposition. I will deal with the details of those amendments at that time; but the principal one is to oppose the inclusion of a register in this legislation, for the reasons I have outlined. Even though the government is going down this path, I hope the Australian Democrats&mdash;and Senator Bell is here&mdash;the Greens and Senator Harradine will recognise that this is an enormous step  backwards in waterfront reform in this country. It is a step that will inhibit our capacity to further improve the waterfront. As I said, it will mean a return to the job-for-life syndrome. I do not have a problem with people having fair employment conditions. However, it would be an incredible mistake by this government if we were to move back to where we were on our waterfront. Such a move would deserve not to be carried in this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill has raised some pretty powerful emotions among waterfront employers since its provisions were first made public. Those emotions are testimony to the depth of feeling between waterfront companies and workers rather than to the awfulness of the bill. On any dispassionate reading, the bill will not make the sky fall in on waterfront reform. The government claims that the thrust of the bill is to finalise the reform process to complete the transition from industry-wide to enterprise-based regulation, and many industry-specific provisions, including the general industry levy, are repealed by the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a skeleton regime comprising the special levies and a pared down stevedoring industry finance committee that will continue until a loan to fund the previous redundancies is paid off. The committee and the levies will be abolished once the remaining funds are disbursed to the minister's satisfaction. The budget papers indicate that these remaining industry-based arrangements will sail off into the sunset within two years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this reasonable way of looking at things, the Australian Democrats have had quite a few representations from waterfront employers and user groups suggesting that the bill opens the door for a return to the bad old days&mdash;a phrase used already in this debate. Their biggest concern is the proposal for a new register of stevedoring employees. The bill has the rather strange effect of abolishing one register and establishing another. The register to be abolished covers waterfront employees and has been used to collect the general levy. Let us be clear that that is its purpose and its effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register to be established covers stevedoring employees and appears to have no use at all. It just exists, apropos of nothing&mdash;or nothing I can determine. When the final curtain comes down on the industry-based arrangements in the near future, apparently the new register will expire too; it will have a distressingly short and unproductive life. The government claims that the new register fulfils Australia's obligations under International Labour Organisation convention No. 137, but any reading of that convention casts some doubt on this claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that convention, the register has a real purpose. Workers on the register are supposed to get preference in waterfront employment. Nothing in this bill links that register with an employment preference scheme. There are preference clauses in relative awards but they do not depend on the register. We would argue that the alarms of some employers have been overstated; that is possible and apparent, but does not seem to have been accepted. We believe that the register provision is merely a formality which does not actually implement the spirit of ILO Convention No. 137. I would argue that the intention of the convention is implemented indirectly by other means, anyway&mdash;for example, award preference clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of convention No. 137 was to soften the blow to waterfront workers that was caused by the move to containerisation in the 70s. At that time it recognised that massive retrenchments would result and that those workers who were affected at that time deserved special treatment during that transition period. But, at this moment, employment levels on the Australian waterfront are not about to undergo major cuts. That is a fact which the Democrats believe calls into question the continuing relevance of that particular convention to Australia. Nevertheless, I would stress that the Democrats remain strongly committed to Australia upholding its international obligations, including its obligations under ILO conventions. But just as I think all honourable senators would recognise that some domestic laws have use-by dates, so too do some international treaties and obligations. In our view, ILO convention No. 137 may well fall into that category of redundancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had discussions with the Maritime Union of Australia about this legislation. It is concerned at the casualisation of the stevedoring work force and believes that this proposed register would help to stem that tide. It seems to us that the existing register has not stopped the move to casual labour, and the new one would not either. There are other forces at work within the industry which are moving in that direction. They are forces which are not modified or curtailed in any way by either the existing register or the proposed register. We do believe there are limits to the utility of casual labour, and that they are limits which are at work as well, independent of the existence of the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In what has been referred to as `the bad old days', casual waterfront labour was little more than hired muscle. However, these days, that muscle has been provided by machines. A skilled, experienced work force is what is required. That is a work force which is not easily obtained if it is casualised to too great an extent. The maritime union also believes that the abolition of the register would leave members vulnerable to employers with bad attitudes. Whether there are employers with bad attitudes is a matter of some discussion and perhaps belongs to another forum. It might be that in some cases those fears have some foundation, but this parliament recently passed the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, a massive piece of legislation which gives substantial protection to employees. If there are bad employers, then that piece of legislation is certainly able to deal with that problem in all areas of employment, including the waterfront. We have not been presented with any compelling justification for special industry measures&mdash;measures specific to the waterfront in this area. In our view, measures will only work if both sides agree. In this case one side appears not to want to play ball. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debate on the bill in the House of Representatives, the minister moved an amendment exempting employers who are keeping employee records from having to submit names to the register. It just happens that employers are required to keep such records by the Industrial Relations Act, anyway. There is a very high probability that no employer would have to hand over the names of their workers for inclusion on the register. So the Senate has before it a proposal for a Clayton's register. Because I have great respect for the minister, I can only conclude that he is pulling our collective legs or that he secretly wants the Senate to put this poor, misunderstood register out of its misery: we are going to oblige him. We will be supporting the opposition's amendment for removing the requirement for the register for stevedoring employees. We believe that it would be a bad law and would cause needless alarm not only in the stevedoring industry but in those aspects of the Australian economy that are directly and indirectly affected by what happens on our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also support the amendment preventing the stevedoring industry finance committee from recommending new industry levies. This amendment simply gives effect to the government's own policy. Again, it will put beyond doubt that the industry arrangements left by this bill are limited and strictly temporary. Lest the disease spread, we will not support the coalition's other amendments. One of them removes the minister's power to appoint employer and employee representatives to the committee that I have spoken about. The other allows delegation of the committee's functions only by consensus. We believe they are unnecessarily restrictive on the committee, especially given that the functions of the committee will be significantly limited by the amendments that we have agreed to pass; in other words, we do not want to constrain this committee so that it would be entirely useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emotion that has been generated by this bill shows that the level of trust between employers and employees on the waterfront remains abysmally low. For the government to come up with a register of such comical design means that it has tied itself in knots trying to reach a compromise here. For waterfront employers and users to predict Armageddon on the basis of that register, is a major over-reaction. It goes to show that it is easier to restructure industries and to amend laws than it is to change attitudes that are steeped in decades of industrial trench warfare. The Democrats will support the second reading of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator Crane on this matter. He set out very well the opposition's objections to parts of this bill and flagged our amendments that we will move in the committee stage. At this stage of the debate I want to register my concern at the lack of speed in changing the waterfront in Australia. It was not that many years ago that the Australian waterfront was regarded as the worst in the world. I applaud the moves that have taken place to improve that situation. I understand that the figures show that there has been a 57 per cent reduction in numbers of people employed on the wharves. That is a very good sign of substantial change, but it has been done at a very substantial cost, and I think the aggregate number, which my colleague mentioned before, is $420 million. But things have slowed down a bit in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry has been inquired to death. There are many reports&mdash;I think there has been a total of 26 reports since 1986. So it is quite clear what needs to be done to face up to being internationally competitive, which the rest of industry has had to do in Australia. The Bureau of Industry Economics report of 1993 found that non-terminal charges for vessels calling at Australian ports were, on average, twice as high as in overseas ports. Another example is given in a recently released index of comparative ports costs by Liner Shipping Services. It reaffirms that Australian ports are amongst the most expensive in the world still, in spite of the good progress that has been made to date, but not fast enough. For example, the German port of Hamburg just edges out Melbourne as the most expensive in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japanese port authorities charge less than half the cost of their Melbourne counterparts. Korean, Hong Kong and Taiwanese ports all charge a quarter of the costs charged by Melbourne ports. In the European and New Zealand trade comparison from the same report, Australia fared a little better but costs were still significantly higher. For example, Melbourne port charges were about three to four times those of Auckland and one and a half times those of Tilbury. Sydney port charges were two and a half times as high as those in Auckland and one and a half times as high as those in Tilbury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming a little closer to home, let us look at the comparison between here and New Zealand. One shipping company which trades across the Tasman advised me that to understand the comparison between the ports in New Zealand and here we need to segregate those costs into two components: first, the stevedoring costs&mdash;that is, the loading and unloading; and, second, the use of port facilities. In respect of stevedoring costs, the comparisons are three to one in New Zealand's favour. In other words, it is three times more expensive for stevedoring in Australia than in New Zealand ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the use of port facilities, there is a very big range in the comparison here in Australia. If we compare Melbourne and Sydney with the New Zealand port of Taronga, the comparison is five to one&mdash;it is five times more expensive here in Australia than in New Zealand. There is some progress, however. If we compare Brisbane with the same port in New Zealand, the ratio is two to one. It is twice as expensive in Brisbane as in New Zealand. I am delighted to say that in my home port of Hobart the ratio is 1.5 to one. I am also pleased to say that Tasmanian ports have made substantial progress in port reduction costs. I cite two examples: the Burnie and Hobart marine boards have enterprise agreements which allow the port authorities to supply supplementary stevedores when and if required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main point I want to stress is that Australia still has a long way to go to be internationally competitive. We have to keep pushing for enterprise agreements and competition in that industry. Hence, as my colleague Senator Crane said earlier, we have to make sure that the Australian ports end up being internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is from that sort of background of the need for everything in Australia to be internationally competitive that we in the opposition oppose this idea of a register, because we do not want any chance of a return to the bad old days of pooling of labour, which we believe is behind this move in this legislation. It may not happen immediately, but it is there as a potential threat. As Senator Bell said, many employers in the industry and users of the industry are very concerned about this proposal, either rightly or wrongly. We should take note of their concern. Hence, we are opposing the establishment of the register as set out in this bill. Also, as Senator Crane has signalled, we have a couple of other amendments to the bill, and they will be discussed in detail at the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is quite amazing that in this debate the Greens (WA) are probably the only ones who have the chance to present the position of the workers in this debate, which is extraordinary considering we have a Labor government. The Maritime Union of Australia cooperated in the waterfront reform process on the basis of an in-principle agreement with the government, the ACTU, stevedoring employers and waterfront unions. The in-principal agreement provided for security of employment of stevedoring workers employed on 31 March 1989. Compulsory redundancy was a last resort for new recruits after the three-year waterfront reform program expired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the waterfront reform process 3,700 left the industry and 250 were recruited. The total reduction in employment in the industry was 57 per cent, far higher than the terms of the in-principle agreement which provided for 3,000 redundancies and 1,000 new recruits to rejuvenate the industry&mdash;a net loss of employment of 2,000. The Maritime Union has supported all government measures consistent with the waterfront reform process, including the provision of removing industry levies and the old `A' register of waterside workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent Australian stevedores dispute, which saw the first compulsory redundancy since 1972 of 55 workers, including 27 union delegates who were sacked, the former chair of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, Peter Evans, recommended a series of measures for the settlement of the dispute, including a federal government inquiry into the structural problems of employment in the stevedoring industry and the use of casual labour.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has given no positive indication that an inquiry will be set up in the terms of Peter Evans's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Maritime Union has also sought government action to maintain a register of all stevedoring industry employees to assist in maintaining preference of employment in all areas where stevedoring unions have award coverage. The particular legislation which provides for a register gave the responsibility to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to keep a register of stevedoring industry employees. It was essentially sunset legislation, because once the SIFC has collected the levy to repay outstanding loans that paid for the last of the WIRA redundancies, the legislation provided for the SIFC will automatically cease to have effect in law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union would have preferred legislation providing for the federal government to maintain a register of all stevedoring employees employed by stevedoring companies. Such a register would have no connection with the collection of levies. Maintaining preference of employment for stevedoring workers is consistent with waterfront reform because the WIRA waterfront reform process was based on improved productivity and efficiency, together with some real measure of security of employment. The proposed legislation setting up a register is a stopgap. Its defeat will be contrary to government commitments under ILO convention 137. This states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Registers shall be established and maintained for all occupational categories of dockworkers in a manner to be determined by national law or practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Registered dockworkers shall have a priority of engagement for dock work.</PARA>
<PARA>The acting joint national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia has written to me to say that, in conjunction with the creation of the stevedoring industry award and appropriate enterprise agreements, there is now an opportunity for stevedoring employees to follow a genuine enterprise related career path which, under industry employment, simply did not exist. Unlike the past, there is now a single entry point into industry enterprises and, as a consequence, a very real incentive to take advantage of opportunities for career advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be clearly understood that the MUA has no intention of returning to the narrow, restricted, unrewarding job and career opportunities of the past. Our concerns relate to the use of casuals and the undeniable replacement of permanent jobs with casual employment that occurred as a result of waterfront reform. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of a register also provides a proper mechanism for tracing employee entitlements, and occupational health and safety claims such as exposure to asbestos and other debilitating and dangerous situations our members come in contact with during the course of their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the register operating in conjunction with the Stevedoring Industry Award ensures the priority of employment of people on the register whilst enabling the further expansion of the AVC Trainee Programme and the introduction of a part-time employment structure which in no way threatens the normal expectations of existing industry employees.</PARA>
<PARA>ILO convention 137 was enacted not only against the backdrop of employment losses caused by containerisation, but also in recognition of the employment insecurity caused by the peaks and troughs of employment of labour which occurs at the waterfront on a daily base. That is, this problem is not about the collection of levies but about the ability of industry to increase the percentage of casual employees and keep pressure on waterfront wages and conditions by disempowering the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) support this legislation but are aware that the numbers in this place support the opposition's amendment to remove the levy. The fact that the government has set up this situation knowing that it will be rolled is a fairly pathetic attempt. In reality, we are leaving the way open to waterfront workers being unable to protect themselves against the casualisation of work, which has implications for workplace health and safety and for pay and conditions. Again it is leading again to the idea that organisations of workers&mdash;unions&mdash;are enemies. In fact, such organisations have the right to exist. They are the only entity that stand between total power by employers over the workplace when push comes to shove. It is time we realised that this is not about anti-competitive behaviour or anything of that nature. It relates to the ability of employers on the waterfront to be able to increase the level of casualisation, decrease the power of workers to speak up for themselves and to keep pressure on workers' pay and conditions. </PARA>

That inefficiency and those rorts have made the Australian waterfront not only much less efficient than practices adopted by our trading partners and our trading competitors, but also they are much more costly in terms of the cost imposed on exporters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole reform process that has been embarked upon on the Australian waterfront, sparingly and grudgingly by this federal government, which has been pushed, prodded and probed by the opposition, has been aimed at trying to improve efficiency. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill which is now before the Senate does nothing to maintain that very necessary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember that the Australian waterfront is vital to the wellbeing of all Australians. It is especially relevant to those seeking to increase the real wealth of this country by building export markets. More than 75 per cent of our international cargo moves through Australia's seaports. That is why any legislation dealing with the waterfront is critical and of crucial importance. Yet today we have  before us a bill affecting the waterfront which contains yet another amendment to the maze of amendments that have been made to the Industrial Relations Act. Indeed, it is the second amendment to the Industrial Relations Act this year. Since 1989 it has taken no fewer than 108 enterprise agreements, supervised and approved by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, at a cost $420 million of which $255 million came from employers and $165 million from taxpayers, together with the retrenchment of some 3,000 waterside workers, to achieve the modest improvements on the waterfront that have thus far been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From its introduction in 1989 to its alleged conclusion in October 1992, the waterfront reform process included a move to enterprise agreements and the conclusion of industry based employment arrangements at the specific request of this government. We need to remember that the Labor government never intended enterprise agreements to be part of the industrial relations system. It was forced to move in that direction and to recognise the logic of freeing up the labour market because of the effective advocacy for so long of the federal opposition, and the Liberal Party in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In possession of this newly found wisdom, this government in 1992 demanded that employers take responsibility for their own work force as a prerequisite to releasing funds to conclude the waterfront reform process. Yet now we see this turnaround by this government as represented in this legislation. It is a return to the dark ages of the waterfront. It is a regime that involves unions dictating to the government as the government pays back the unions for the help they gave the Keating Labor government to ensure its re-election a little over a year ago. It was a caving in to the Maritime Union of Australia which steadfastly refuses to accept that waterfront workers, in line with the rest of the Australian work force, should no longer have a job-for-life guarantee. </PARA>

That may attract some mirth, but the issue I want to address in this debate is a very serious one. This is Schizophrenia Awareness Week, and we often need to be challenged by such an important focus within our community. The fact that many people often draw to our attention the behavioural patterns of individuals or organisations, even political organisations, and classify them under schizophrenia or schizophrenic activity demands our attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week Senator Patterson and I have given notice of several motions that we will move in the Senate on the very important issue of Schizophrenia Awareness Week. In those notices of motion both Senator Patterson and I have drawn attention to the very important issues that need to be addressed, specifically the need for continuing research in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schizophrenia affects not only the people immediately involved but also the parents, the carers and the wider community surrounding those people. To determine what is schizophrenia we need to look at the symptoms. They include disordered thinking, delusions, hallucinations, inappropriate emotional expression, social withdrawal, severe loss of motivation, and denial. I am sure we could identify many of our associates, family and friends as exhibiting those symptoms from time to time and therefore needing to be tested. It is very interesting to note the various documents that are produced by groups such as the Schizophrenia Fellowship and other very worthwhile organisations in the community. I commend a reading of the check lists that come out which try to identify those symptoms or look at behavioural patterns of young people, particularly, that affect many of us. How often do we tend to put it aside when people are rude, lazy, argumentative, irritable, overemotional, oversensitive, weepy or withdrawn? We tend to say that that is just a behavioural matter. It may well be, and it may be an issue of no serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if we look through some of the more detailed check lists that are available and look at the abnormal behaviours, we find people withdrawing completely from family, friends and workmates; being afraid to leave their homes; sleeping or eating poorly; being extremely preoccupied with a particular theme, such as death, politics or religion; uncharacteristically neglecting household or parental responsibilities or personal appearance and hygiene; deteriorating in performance at school or work; or leaving jobs. The list goes on and on. The check lists that are available draw attention to the need to challenge people to seek medical assessment or professional attention very early to identify those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed being the shadow minister for community services for a period of years until last Friday. That responsibility has now been transferred to other people. One of the highlights of the visits I made to groups around Australia, in the last few years, was a visit to the Bromham Place Clubhouse in Melbourne in Victoria. There I was shown, acquainted with, and participated in discussions with, the membership of people who have been drawn from a very wide range of groups of people with psychiatric disability. I was shown how this clubhouse essentially was run by the members and how they overcome many of the difficulties presented by their illness, with the support of many others, in working together through this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I commend the work of so many voluntary agencies and community groups, such as Bromham Place in Melbourne, in challenging, in what is a very exciting and interesting project, this whole area of schizophrenia. Similarly, there is loads of material available to all of us to read on this matter. Since last year, what has been on the table, I would hope, of every honourable senator, is the Burdekin report into mental illness. Commissioner Burdekin's report has challenged us in so many areas of mental illness and mental health. It is disappointing that the government has not responded adequately or properly to that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition formed a task force late last year comprising Senator Patterson, Senator Newman, Senator Herron and myself. It was certainly a challenge to all of us to sit down and review these areas. The response that was made by the Liberal and National parties to the Burdekin report is certainly one that people should be encouraged to look at and read, to see the vision that we had. Sadly, the Labor government has not picked up on many of those initiatives. Sure, there are some areas in this year's budget that do address this area, and I would commend those programs. But I am going to be asking questions in further estimates&mdash;as I am sure Senator Patterson also will be&mdash;on how much of that funding is going to be dedicated in additional public service, bureaucratic types of systems rather than being delivered through the appropriate carers in the community. </PARA>

This particular project, headed by team leader Dr John Hoult and research officer Heidi Burchmore, is a very commendable document&mdash;lengthy, but commendable&mdash;that analyses all of the regions around Australia and how they rate in this important area of looking at what are good services, and how they are particularly put together. </PARA>

Firstly&mdash;and importantly, probably, because of where it is placed&mdash;is the lack of resources. I will quote from that paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overwhelmingly the problem that struck us immediately as we went around Australia, was the lack of resources in the community mental health services. In some areas the lack is truly appalling, in particular, in the rural regions of Queensland and South Australia and in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Then further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would estimate that there are only a handful of regions, covering perhaps 10 per cent of the population of the country, which have staffing levels even approaching adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>The further points that have been identified in this particular study paper are the lack of rural services, the lack of services for Aboriginal people, the lack of rehabilitation, the lack of adequate housing, the lack of integration of services, the lack of psychiatrists in public practice and the failure to talk to patients, relatives and carers. The report, of course, is much more comprehensive than I can give due credit to here in a brief speech on a matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will pick up one of my own points and bugbears, through my personal experience this year in having to deal with youth suicide. Sadly, I became acquainted with such a situation in a very close series of young people associated with my own family. There is this link in schizophrenia with the abuse and the use of cannabis and marijuana. There have been challenges to the government to look very seriously at continuing further studies in this particular area&mdash;on the effect on people who are prone to schizophrenia, who then abuse or misuse marijuana, and on the subsequent effects. There is a need for urgent attention in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had drawn to my attention, as part of my research in this area, a recent report of a very comprehensive study in Sweden, a 15-year program of study of military conscripts. The Andreasson report brings together that study and certainly identifies for that country, Sweden, the links that are so concerning. We are at a point of history in Australia where the economic conditions that have been foisted by the Australian Labor Party government on so many young people have had compounding effects on their employment. I believe it is incumbent on the government now to do a similar, comprehensive study in Australia&mdash;not necessarily over a 15-year period, as was done in Sweden&mdash;of the links between cannabis and schizophrenia. I would take it one step further and include the link with unemployment that is such a severe and major problem in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schizophrenia Awareness Week certainly focuses our attention on this issue. I commend to the attention of all honourable senators the notices of motion that have been given by Senator Patterson and me. I believe that this is an issue that must be pursued with a degree of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tambling has said, this week is Schizophrenia Awareness Week. We are discussing an illness that affects about 170,000 people and that probably accounts for more hospital beds than any other illness. It is a disease that strikes young people in particular at the very peak of their careers and their lives. Senator Tambling mentioned Bromham Place. I do not know whether Mr Staples ever visited Bromham Place when he had responsibility for this area or whether Dr Lawrence will ever have time with the load she has been given, but Bromham Place has a fascinating program run by the Victorian division of the Schizophrenia Association of Australia. There is a clubhouse for young people particularly but also for others who have been afflicted by the expression of schizophrenia. The aim of Bromham Place is to assist people to assist themselves. Instead of operating on a medical model, in Bromham Place they operate on a model of getting people back into the community and getting them to help each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people will participate together in a program. They have training programs in computers. They have a program of providing a meal at lunchtime. Whoever is on duty goes to purchase a meal. Club members will ring and say that they are going to be there in time for lunch and, if they do, they can have lunch. If somebody has not been to the club for a couple of days, a buddy or a colleague will ring up and say, `We have not seen you,' just to make sure that the person has not gone into a decline or is having an episode. The whole concept is one of mutual support, of people assisting each other. One hears stories there of young people, in the middle of their fourth-year honours program, suddenly having a major schizophrenic attack, never having had one before. Schizophrenia is no discriminator of people. There are people there who are employed as clerks, people who are in the middle of their honours degrees, people from rich families and people from poor families. This disease strikes, and could strike, any family at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the various voluntary organisations working with people with schizophrenia for holding Schizophrenia Awareness Week. Schizophrenia tends to be the mental illness that bears the greatest brunt of jokes and myths about dual personalities. Some of the ideas about schizophrenia are totally wrong. They have been based on television programs or films. People do not really understand the complexities of the illness or of the way in which it can affect people. It can affect people very differently, in different ways at different times in their lives, and with different levels of intensity, even within the same person. There are differences between people and differences within individuals at various stages and processes of this illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it manifests itself in many ways. There are differences in severity and there is no single symptom that allows a diagnosis. What we see sometimes is behavioural deficits or blunted emotions or inappropriate responses to situations or an incongruity between what the individual is saying and their emotional behaviour. They themselves often get an insight into that which must be very terrifying if any of us can imagine not quite knowing where reality begins and where reality ends. For them, that must be one of the most terrifying experiences, especially for those who, at the point of being in a florid episode, understand that there is some sort of problem between what they interpret as reality and what they do not interpret as reality. It is a disorder which must be distressing&mdash;that is not a strong enough word&mdash;for the sufferer and also for all the families associated with those people who are afflicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It affects men and women in equal numbers. Men seem to suffer at an earlier age, in their late teens and early twenties, while women often seem to have their first episode or exhibit the first signs of schizophrenia in their late twenties. When one goes to Bromham Place, one sees people who have been cut down in the prime of their life. They have had all sorts of ambitions and goals&mdash;all the sorts of hopes that we would have had as young people. Suddenly this illness causes them to reassess their whole life. It does not enable them to continue on the path on which they started out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other mental illnesses, schizophrenia is surrounded by ignorance and fear. There is a general ignorance in the community about mental illness. There is ignorance about how common it is and how it can be treated. There is a fear of the old superstitious stigma of mental illness which originally sprang from ignorance and from times when people presumed that people who had a mental illness were possessed by devils. Some of that old fear and superstition hangs over. It is not only dealing with their own disorder that is a problem; it is also dealing with the way the community responds to them when they have this illness. So they have got a double whammy; they are coping with their own disorder as well as coping with the myths and the stigma and the misconceptions that surround their particular illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Society also perceives mental illness as a weakness and something of which people ought to be ashamed. This has forced many people, in particular people with schizophrenia, to live in isolation and sometimes to be neglected and sometimes to be abused. The illness itself and the stigma attached to it have dramatic effects on the individual's self-esteem and on their family. Tony Mannix, an artist who has lived with schizophrenia since he was 25, said, `The crushing thing about schizophrenia is that you remain a second-class citizen.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think mental illness has to be one of the last taboos left over from the Middle Ages. We have got over many of the things that we did not discuss. I was sitting here the other day when we were having a discussion about something in the chamber&mdash;it was some matter to do with sexually transmitted diseases or something&mdash;and I said to one of my colleagues, `I wonder whether 100 years ago they would have talked about this in the chamber with the same openness.' Schizophrenia is similar. People do not want to talk about it. It is probably one of the last bastions of taboo. It ought to be out in the open. We ought to know the positive things about the achievements of people who have a mental illness; what can be done; how they can be treated; how they can actually live with their illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I will not just single out Bromham Place but it is one example of what can be done when voluntary sector efforts and the efforts of individuals with a disorder can be harnessed to assist each other. When I went to Bromham Place, one of the saddest things was that they were looking to employ two people to run a supported employment program with the club members so that club members who felt they were able to go into open employment could be assisted to do so. They needed something like $140,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I sat there, I thought that I would like to bring some people down here. Maybe some ministers or some bureaucrats who had made a few errors&mdash;for example, somebody who sent out postage that should not have been sent out; somebody who made an error in buying a piece of equipment that was a dud; somebody who had let a contract that had gone down the drain; or somebody who had done something in the Customs department and, suddenly, the taxpayer had to pay $25 million in compensation. I could have spent that $25 million a thousand times over on programs like Bromham Place. I could have spent it over and over on people with dementia and mental illness in nursing homes and hostels. I could have spent it a thousand times over in Bromham Place and my heart ached when I saw that, because of a blunder in Customs, we had to compensate for it. I am not saying that they should not have been compensated. I am saying that it should not have happened in the first place. We, the taxpayers, had to pay $25 million in compensation. There are people such as the club members of Bromham Place who want assistance to go into open employment but they are unable to get this assistance because there is no money to employ those support and employment officers. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody who is involved in waste and fraud and improper conduct ought to be reminded that the money that is wasted is guns and butter in economic terms. Every time money is wasted through fraud, through the letting of incompetent contracts, through somebody making a wrong decision about purchasing equipment&mdash;and I note that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, have pointed out time and time again with the wastewatch committee some of the wasteful ways in which this government has spent money&mdash;every time there is waste on the other side of the equation, we ought to remember that a program such as a supported employment program for Bromham Place cannot be undertaken. When one goes to those places, one is really aware that there is a social cost for that waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling said that the Burdekin report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights and Mental Illness</EMPHASIS> released last October found that at least 250,000 Australians suffered from major mental illness and up to 20 per cent of the adult population had or would develop some kind of mental illness, but only three per cent ever came to the attention of specialist services. The report highlighted the problem and the urgent need for reform in the mental health system. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People affected by mental illness are among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community. They suffer from widespread, systemic discrimination and are constantly denied the rights and services to which they are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to add to the bottom of that `often because the government has wasted money' and therefore the money is not available for those services. But not only that. The report details serious neglect of Australia's mentally ill and widespread violations of human rights. It documented the discrimination and the abuse that people with mental illness suffered, as well as the bureaucratic minefield and unacceptable standards of accommodation that they endured. It highlighted the fact that many get no effective treatment at all and that there is an alarming rate of youth suicide associated with mental illness. If one goes into rural areas, as I do, one sees that it is even more highlighted in rural areas. Access to services for people with mental illness is appallingly low; it is very difficult to find access to psychiatric and other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Burdekin report pointed out, the Australian mental health system has failed to cater in a humane and proper way for people who are often in desperate need of care and understanding. Ignorance and fear in the community have provided the perfect cover for inactivity by governments. As I was saying before, there is this taboo. Many of us do not want to face up to it. If we put it away in the cupboard, it will disappear. Well, it will not and those people are suffering, while we close our eyes or turn our heads to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deinstitutionalisation, as Burdekin pointed out, may have been a good idea in theory. In practice, half the nation's mentally ill ended up in the streets because there was no place for them in institutions and governments do not provide community based care to cope with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first got into this chamber, about seven years ago, I went along to open a conference on psychiatry, law and psychology. One of the first speakers at that conference was a professor of psychiatry from New York, who said at the conference, `Let me tell you here and now that all we have done through the process of deinstitutionalisation in the United States, especially in New York, is to shift them onto the streets. If you are going to do it you need to be warned that, if you do not do it properly, all you will do is increase the number of homeless people&mdash;in particular, homeless people with mental illness&mdash;on the streets.' He was one of the advocates of deinstitutionalisation in New York and he was coming to Australia to warn us that we needed to be very aware of the pitfalls of deinstitutionalisation&mdash;not that we should not address that issue, but that we needed to be aware of the pitfalls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of care for the mentally ill is indefensible. The government will respond by saying that in this year's budget it has pledged an extra $169 million over the next four years towards mental health. The fact is that this government has been in power for 11 years and it has had that time to address this situation, yet it took the government until Burdekin to recognise that the problem existed. Anyone who had been in the area I had been working in could have told the government 12 years ago that dementia was going to be a problem and that schizophrenia was a problem, particularly in young people. But no, until the report by Mr Burdekin, 10 or 11 years down the track, when it was obvious to people working in the community and voluntary organisations that this was a problem, the government did not address it. Now it is turning around late&mdash;very late and for many people far too late. Many have missed the boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need to replace fear and ignorance with knowledge and choices. That is the point of Schizophrenia Awareness Week: to replace fear and ignorance with knowledge, understanding and, hopefully, action to improve the lives of people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for a few minutes to refer to the strong concern of many citizens within my state of South Australia about a hostel for the aged. I refer to the Southern Districts War Memorial Hospital, at McLaren Vale in South Australia, which is within the federal division of Kingston. There is a great need for a hostel to be associated with this hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 1,000 citizens of South Australia have signed a petition to urge the federal government to make provision for this hostel. I have the petition in my hands. It is some 70 sheets of paper; it has come to me in various parts over the last several weeks and it contains 1,059 signatures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition, unfortunately, is not in a form to be presented at the time of presenting petitions because it does not exactly fit the definitions of our standing orders and it is addressed equally to the state parliament of South Australia and to the federal parliament. I therefore want to put firmly on the record the words of the petition. Although technically not conforming to our standing orders, it addresses a matter of very real significance. I do this to keep faith with these 1,000-plus South Australians. The petition is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned residents of the catchment area served by the Southern Districts War Memorial Hospital Inc., at McLaren Vale, South Australia, seek the support and agreement in principle of the Federal and State governments in the following: to allocate funding for residential hostel accommodation in aged care services to be established at the hospital as a priority for the financial year 1994-95 in the government's program of care services for older people. The Willunga Local Government Area currently has no hostel accommodation facilities and is serviced inappropriately, with residents having to leave the district for hostel accommodation and care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Signatures and addresses are given for the 1,059. The addresses are almost entirely from the following suburbs or semi-rural areas: McLaren Vale, Maslin Beach, Sellicks, Reynella, Morphett Vale, Moana, Aldinga, O'Halloran Hill, Seaford, Hackham, Willunga, Victor Harbour-Mt Compass, McLaren Flat and Noarlunga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other element to the petition. Understandably, it is circulated in April-May with the hope of affecting the financial year allocations by the government to begin in July this year. With more careful advice, these citizens would have been encouraged to have got their petition together in December last year in order to have the full impact upon that financial year's budget. I nevertheless urge that full consideration be given by the Commonwealth government, in proper liaison with the state government of South Australia, to include it at the earliest possible time so that this project might go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore&mdash;through you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;put this plea to the duty minister, the parliamentary secretary in the chamber. I also put it to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, the Hon. Brian Howe, not least because of his involvement in these matters of policy over many years; to the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin; to the Minister for Human Services and Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Carmen Lawrence; and also to the South Australian minister assisting in these areas, the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. I urge these ministers and their advisers, and the public servants in departments that can carry out the liaison and formulation of putting this in place, to respond to this petition from South Australia. </PARA>

The post office box number is 313 at McLaren Vale, South Australia 5171. I conclude by noting that we sometimes have the greatest difficulty as members of parliament in bringing to the attention of an incumbent government the desperate needs of people for institutions such as a hostel. Public servants and ministers, even with good intentions, sometimes say, `We have to look at this ruthlessly on the basis of how many hostel places are provided per head of population.'</PARA>

There are continuing needs, not least in the new suburbs such as those I listed earlier in the south. There are new and developing suburbs where elderly people are now coming for the first time and they need such a hostel. Also, older Australians want to live close to their own families such as those who are living in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. I do urge the Commonwealth government to respond positively to this petition. I seek leave to table the document. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to parliament resuming for the budget I was in Toowoomba, where I was presented with an open letter from the parents and friends of Our Lady of Lourdes School, Toowoomba, and a covering letter from Mr Mike Horan, MLA, and Mr Graham Healy, MLA, who are the members for Toowoomba South and Toowoomba North respectively. The letter from the parents and friends of Our Lady of Lourdes School, Toowoomba, is quite interesting&mdash;not just because it is supported by 208 signatures from a very small primary school in Toowoomba but, more importantly, because of the matter it raises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter that these parents raise is very simply this: there has come to be a process by which the television stations, which have been forced to put more explicit or more violent movies on later in the evening, are running promos for those programs earlier in the day. The consequence, the parents say, is that it is very difficult for them to shield their young children from violence or sexually explicit scenes. The letter reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have become extremely concerned of late about two aspects of Australian Television Broadcasting that is becoming harder for us parents to police during the periods allocated to children's and family viewing.</PARA>

<PARA>The point these people make is very real. It is quite possible for a television station to run a promo&mdash;I understand that this letter was prompted by a promo for the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Basic Instinct</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for a movie at 8.30 in a 6.30 or 7 o'clock television slot. In some cases there are complaints that explicit or violent promos are being run at 5.30 in the afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there has been a big debate, and rightly so, about the regulation of the television industry, freedom of speech and so on, but the television stations themselves have recognised that it is appropriate that certain programs be put into a later hour of the evening. Why then the necessity to run these sorts of advertisements or promos earlier in the day? It is interesting that these promos are sometimes called teasers. They are called teasers for a very simple reason&mdash;the stations take the juiciest bits of a television program, splice them into a 30-second advertisement and tease the audience into wanting to watch it. That is why they are run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they have that effect on adults, it is not unreasonable for us to expect that they will have the same effect on children. What the parents who have written this letter have said to me is very simply that they do not mind these programs being put on at that hour, because they can control when their children go to bed, but they do object to the promos for these programs being shown at this hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the promo for the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Basic Instinct</EMPHASIS>, they said there was no point in watching the movie if one wanted to see something juicy, because all the best and juiciest bits had already been in the promo.

What I say is simply that the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations must take a tough line. I know there is a guideline that says that promos should not contain this material. I understand that it is the case&mdash;I could be wrong here&mdash;that stations are not required to submit promos which are made in-house to FACTS, for understandable reasons. But it is important that these standards are adhered to. Our commercial broadcasters have a big community responsibility, as does the ABC and as does SBS, to the parents whose children are in front of the television set; and the parents are saying that what is happening is not acceptable. I will just return to the letter that has been signed by Messrs Horan and Healey. They make a couple of very good points.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The other matter I wish to raise is about a youth forum which I attended and facilitated in Alice Springs a number of weeks ago. That was very interesting, because there are many people in this country who say that young Australians are layabouts, that young Australians have no set of values, and that young Australians do not contribute anything to our community. It was very interesting to find that in a town like Alice Springs we had something like 40 young people turn up, of their own volition, to discuss topics that were of importance to them. It might be very interesting for honourable senators to know that one of the subjects which was raised by the people who attended the youth forum was the question of the legalisation of marijuana&mdash;a very topical subject in the Australian parliament at this point in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were people clearly in favour of it and people clearly were against it, just as there are in this parliament, I am led to believe, and just as there are outside. After a long period of discussion, one of the clear recommendations of everybody present was that there should be better research into the long-term effects of marijuana use. Many of the people there were under the belief that marijuana was less harmful than tobacco. It is my understanding that that is not correct. Certainly, Dr Brendan Nelson, who is the President of the AMA, has argued the opposite: that there are long-term psychological damages which may result from the use of marijuana over a prolonged period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what they all said at the end of the day, whether they were for it or against it, was, `So that we can have an informed debate, what we need is more research.' Clearly we do need to do research on this topic, but there is also research which has been done&mdash;and I think it is incumbent on the government to make people aware of what that research says. We need to ascertain whether Dr Nelson is correct or not. I happen to be one of the people&mdash;and I have said it publicly before&mdash;who are opposed to the legalisation of marijuana. But if I am wrong, if the medical evidence is against me, then I want to know so that I can make an informed decision. The young people of Alice Springs said exactly the same thing. They said, `We do not know enough to make a decision here and now. Please ensure that there is more research done, and that the research which is done is publicised so that everybody knows about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have an intelligent debate on these matters, rather than just the usual run-of-the-mill newspaper surveys which do not ultimately shed any light on the real issues&mdash;they are interesting from a statistical point of view but nothing else&mdash;then I believe it is in the interests of all Australians and in the interests of our community that we have informed debate, and that this research is better publicised and made available in a form that Australians can understand. That is because, ultimately, a lot of this medical and scientific research is just mumbo jumbo to ordinary people like you and me, Mr Acting Deputy President, who do not have any medical qualifications. Highly intelligent as you are and wise in your judgments, we still have this problem that we do have difficulty at times in understanding some of the research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that was discussed at the youth forum was also of interest. It was the issue of vandalism and juvenile delinquency; it was the issue of young people roaming the streets late at night; it was the issue of youth crime. It is frequently argued, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I am sure you have heard it as well, that youth crime occurs because young people have nothing to do. Of course, what happens is that governments go out and they spend large sums of money putting up facilities. The facilities are utilised for six months, 12 months or 18 months and then they fall into disuse and are never really utilised again. Then 12 months, two, three or four years later, the problem re-emerges and people say, `We need to spend more money on providing facilities for young people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we provide more money again and again. They have a short-term palliative effect but, ultimately, little is done. I am not saying that there is not a problem in some regional centres in terms of facilities, because there very clearly is. In Cairns we addressed that problem recently, through our own community, by erecting a police citizens youth centre. It has surpassed all expectations and is something of which I am very proud to have been a supporter. Many people on both sides of politics in Cairns are very proud to have been the supporters of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, after about an hour and a half of debate on the issue, the young people arrived at a very interesting conclusion. It was that talk of needing more facilities often hides an essential truth, which is that people themselves must have the motivation to utilise their time productively. That means that we have to do a lot more at schools. This is what they were saying, that we have to do a lot more at schools to teach people how to be productive with their time&mdash;how to be good citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms that I have, and one of the criticisms that many people have, about so-called citizenship education is that too frequently we tell people what are their rights as citizens, but we do not explain to them what are their obligations as citizens. Ultimately this truth must prevail: that if rights are to exist in this society, then responsibilities must be beside them and, in many cases, must take priority over them. Only by all individuals in our society observing their responsibilities can we ultimately protect the rights of other people. What the people at the youth forum in Alice Springs said is, `We believe that more needs to be done to educate young people as they go through school on how to be productive, on how to make a contribution to society, on what their responsibilities are, so that we can produce better young people and, ultimately, better Australians.' The future of this country is not in our hands. It will be, in a very short number of years, in the hands of other people who are at schools and universities now. We must make this investment in them because it is an investment in their future and ours. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forgetting for a moment Mr Knott's esteemed position in the community as our representative in the Australian Parliament, he of course has every right as a citizen to oppose a decision made by his local council.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the figurative element to Mr Knott's outburst, there is every reason for him to feel ashamed of the incident and the example he is setting to young constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decent course of action for Mr Knott to follow is to publicly apologise to the two councillors&mdash;not only for their own sake&mdash;but also for the sake of those who may have been contemplating the possibility of taking Mr Knott seriously as an MP.</PARA>
<PARA>I have had my disagreements with Mr Knott in this parliament. The Senate may remember his disgraceful behaviour over the matter of an outstanding bill of 2 3/4 years to a Shoalhaven doctor&mdash;a doctor who not only is of high repute but, I am glad to say, is a friend of mine and whom I entrusted with the anaesthetics when I had a modest operation at Shoalhaven Hospital some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate may not be aware, however, that late last year, when invited as a representative of the government to attend the graduation ceremony at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creswell</EMPHASIS>, Mr Knott did attend HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creswell</EMPHASIS> but, on seeing that there was a picket line there of cleaners and others who were about to be part of the very sensible government privatisation arrangements in that area, instead of performing his duty to attend that graduation ceremony Mr Knott joined the picket lines. I do not know what prompts Mr Knott, but I can say to him that his duty as a member of parliament should be paramount and I would hope that he would keep that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another example that the Senate ought to become aware of. I refer to a copy of a letter that Mr Knott sent on 7 December 1933 to Mr Boag, of Boag's Travel Service. He quite offensively addressed his letter to `Dear Mr Bog' rather than `Boag'. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read with interest your letter to the Prime Minister's department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too bad your mother didn't convince you to tell the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to your opinion of me, coming from a person like you, I can only take your disapproval as a compliment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't catch on fire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Knott.</PARA>
<PARA>I join with the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kiama Independent</EMPHASIS> in saying that it is certainly in the parliament's interests, let alone in Mr Knott's interests, that he behave in a manner in which he can be taken seriously as a member of parliament. If he does not, I would look at this kind of behaviour with concern. I think it demeans the status of the parliament and I think it demeans Mr Knott. There may be many who take that as something of a blessing, as it will certainly not assist him in his attempts to be re-elected to his marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a greater concern than that, which is that this behaviour lowers the status, in the public mind, of members of parliament. I earnestly entreat Mr Knott to do as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kiama Independent</EMPHASIS> has recommended and apologise to the two people involved, and, perhaps more importantly, to apologise to the parliament of Australia for the diminution in the status of the parliament in people's minds that emerges from that kind of behaviour. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the document being prepared by his government's propaganda machine to educate the public about Australia's foreign debt crisis, following Mr Keating's reported claim to caucus that foreign debt was not `bad'. I ask Senator Evans: is the Prime Minister now seriously telling the Australian people that the massive blow-out in net foreign debt from $23 billion to $169 billion, and to a gross $210 billion under Labor, is not bad for the Australian economy? Is the government seriously telling us that the $18 billion in annual interest payments on this debt is not bad or was Treasury wrong when it gave a chilling warning in its own budget papers? It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the build up of external debt during the 1980's has almost certainly imposed costs on the economy, including through increased interest rates and greater vulnerability to external shocks.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1065" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make, as the Prime Minister did, is that the build-up in foreign debt as a result of ongoing current account deficits&mdash;and there obviously has been such a build-up over the last decade&mdash;is not necessarily an undesirable development, so long as the deficits are geared towards exploiting investment opportunities which are capable of generating sufficient returns to cover servicing costs. I repeat the point: it is not necessarily an undesirable development, so long as the deficits are geared towards exploiting investment opportunities which are capable of generating sufficient returns to cover servicing costs&mdash;and they are. Let us look at the content of Australia's foreign debt at the moment. Around 61 per cent of it is owed by private sector borrowers; and it is they, rather than the community as a whole, that accept the risk&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Campbell" NAMEID="H15">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So it's all their fault, is it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the senator listens, he might learn something. It is the private sector, rather than the community as a whole, that accepts the risks associated with its financial obligations. The remainder of that amount is accounted for by state governments with 25 per cent; and 14 per cent is accounted for by public trading enterprises. The Commonwealth government is a net lender. In terms of the crucial issue of capacity to service this debt&mdash;if those opposite will listen long enough to understand the point in issue&mdash;the situation is that servicing costs, as a proportion of total exports, have fallen from 21 per cent at the end of June 1990 to right on 11.3 per cent at the end of December 1993. That reflects not only a decline in world interest rates but continued strong growth in exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt service ratio, as it exists at the moment&mdash;the international method for determining the capacity to handle any given level of foreign debt&mdash;of 11.3 per cent is the lowest it has been for a decade. The usual measure of a difficult, dangerous debt service ratio is when it starts to get up above 20 per cent. Our debt service ratio, the percentage of our exports that we need to service that debt, is down to 11.3 per cent at the moment, the lowest it has been for a decade and very low in any comparable international terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make is that the government does recognise the constraints that are imposed by increasing levels of foreign debt and the importance over the medium term of reducing Australia's current account deficit and stabilising the external debts as a proportion of GDP. We have, of course, initiated policies aimed at reducing the imbalance between national savings and national investment in order to reduce that reliance on foreign savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, of course, we are committed to the medium-term deficit reduction strategy to reduce that deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We have made substantial progress in that respect in this year's budget. We will continue to do so, and we will meet that particular target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee is also designed to help raise private sector saving over time&mdash;something that those opposite have rejected, will not be a part of. How else they are going to improve the savings ratio I do not know because they have made no rational, helpful or sensible contribution to that debate. Of course, we have the situation of micro-economic reform measures being necessary to increase the efficiency with which capital is used also reducing our national investment needs over time, and we are continuing with a very solid and substantial micro-economic reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the story, Mr President. I do not need any education, the government does not need any education, from the layabouts on the other side of this chamber. They have no rational contribution to make to economic policy; they have no basis at all for any criticism they make of that existing level of debt. The explanation for it is clear, what we are doing about it is clear, and we can certainly handle it with the present level of our exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question after that incredible answer. Is Senator Evans suggesting that somehow or another private debt is good and public debt is bad, which is a ridiculous proposition? Even if he were arguing it, is he aware that almost $100 billion of our foreign debt is public sector debt? Will the government's foreign debt propaganda document also educate the Australian public about the increasing likelihood of the re-emergence of the boom-bust cycle, coupled with rising interest rates and higher unemployment? Will this document also address Mr Keating's responsibility for the emergence in Australia of a permanent underclass and the redistribution of wealth upwards? In other words, is this document going to tell even half the truth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the case that there is any difference as between public and private sector debt, other than this: when we are talking about private sector debt we are talking about the private sector rather than the community as a whole accepting the risks that are associated with that particular debt. That is all that that means. It is not a matter that impacts upon the Australian community as taxpayers because it is not the community as taxpayers that has to handle that burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make is that when we talk about the level of public sector debt it is important to appreciate that the Commonwealth is a net lender.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report has been released today by the chairman of the commission, John Woodward. It has been a very thorough one in providing analysis of the area and in making recommendations for the future use of Shoalwater Bay. While I do not want to discuss specific issues addressed in the report at this early stage, it is clear that the commission has found the area to be of outstanding natural significance on a national and regional basis. The commission found:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Area's terrestrial and marine environments represent large and relatively undisturbed habitat areas. . . including populations of rare and threatened species.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Area is the largest coastal area with high wilderness values on the east coast of Australia south of Cooktown, and, as such, is regionally and nationally very significant.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission has recommended that the conservation use of the area should be recognised as being equally significant with its existing use as a military training area. In summary, the commission found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any combination of uses and activities contemplated for the Area should not degrade these values, nor place at risk the status of the Area in the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission concluded that mineral sandmining would have potential adverse effects on the undisturbed nature of the area's landforms. Some loss of wetlands from mineral sandmining would occur. Large areas of plant communities would be destroyed, and there would be significant adverse impacts on fauna population and diversity in mined areas because of loss or disturbance and fragmentation of habitat. In addition, mineral sandmining operations on the higher dunes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would clearly detract from the Area's outstanding natural visual amenity.</PARA>
<PARA>The impact of sandmining on the archaeological values would&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cause distress to local Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>The report has recommended that no mining or mineral exploration be allowed at Shoalwater Bay. The commission has further found that the area is an important catchment for the Capricorn Coast water supply, and recommended that no activity which places that water supply at risk be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the current uses and activities contemplated for the area, the commission found that there is no evidence to indicate that the national estate values of the area have been seriously affected by Defence use and management of the area, and that the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage values has been maintained overall. The issues dealt with in the report are important ones for the government, and they will need careful consideration by cabinet before decisions are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, I will of course, like other ministers, be reading the report closely. I will be visiting the area myself to see its qualities at first hand. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the efforts of the inquiry commissioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health. Is the minister aware that another half a million Australians have dropped out of private health insurance in the last 12 months and that since the introduction of Medicare nearly half of the population covered by private health insurance has dropped out&mdash;from 70 per cent in 1983 down to only 38 per cent now? As every one per cent of the population dropping out of private health insurance costs Medicare in excess of $100 million a year, what action will the government take to address this health care crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to say at this stage that there is no evidence of a crisis at all&mdash;none. There are a number of assumptions in what Senator Herron said and I am advised that it is important to actually try to work this on fact, not his preferred fictions. For a start, a number of the people dropping out of the private health insurance system are people who are young and healthy or people at any age who are healthy. They are people who are currently making no demands on private health, not using it, and sensibly making a decision not to use it. Of course, these people will not be a demand on the public health system; that is well understood. Senator Herron understood that more than most.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they are not necessarily dependent at all. It is important to know that if young and healthy people or healthy people are dropping out of private insurance they will put no increased demand on the public health system. Secondly, in any event Medicare grants have been increased substantially since 1 July 1993. They are indexed for population growth and there is a commitment to review if there is a significant shift in demand from the private to the public health sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know that that is not a new issue. The figures today show merely a continuing trend, but it is not a new issue. It is an issue that the government is well aware of and is serious about. That is why the previous Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, set up an inquiry to examine the problem. That major policy review is still under way. When the report comes to the minister, Dr Lawrence, she will examine it and the government will consider its response in the light of the information available from that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true to note that the government recognises the demand on the public sector that is called waiting lists&mdash;a piece of data that we know is fraught because of what is emerging, very importantly, from Victoria, for example. Senator Herron, more than most of his colleagues, knows the facts of this matter. I hope that at some stage he gets around to explaining the facts to them. The government, recognising the need to address the waiting lists question, provided large funds to the private hospital system to take public patients through the private hospital system and reduce the lists in that way. That has happened in a few places. The Illawarra region is one which, as Senator Herron and I know, did very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened recently is that the surgeons of Australia have refused to operate on public patients in private hospitals. There has been a very low uptake of those dollars. There is a system where the government, recognising the need to assist in this matter, has found itself unable to do this because the surgeons have rejected the prospect of operating on public patients in private hospitals. Certainly, it is a matter that we are aware of. Certainly, it is a matter that the government understands. Certainly, there is funding under the Medicare agreements to deal with it, and there is no crisis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would recall that I answered a question a couple of weeks ago&mdash;I know they will remember it well&mdash;in which I complained about the fact that certain councils were allowing residential development within flight paths. The ever diligent Senator Chapman put out a press statement saying that this was what the RAAF was doing at Edinburgh. Of course, he did not take any care to look at where the RAAF was developing land near Edinburgh. Mr President, you would not be surprised to know it is not in the flight path. So this well-informed South Australian senator, who obviously knows nothing of the geography of that area, got it wrong yet again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to Senator McMullan in his capacity as the Minister for Trade and also in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer to press reports that Japan has criticised Australian government procurement policies. If Australia were to sign the GATT-related multilateral agreement on government procurement, would it inhibit: the policy to favour Australian companies where this is consistent with value for money; the Bevis committee's recommendation, taken up in the white paper, to place more emphasis on the development of Australian industries; or imposing requirements on foreign suppliers with regard to local content, technology transfer to Australian companies and offset arrangements for the purchase or export of Australian products? Since the answer is likely to be yes, will the minister give an assurance that Australia will not sign the agreement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The GATT procurement code was revised as a result of the Uruguay Round and Australia is still assessing its response to that revised agreement. Referring to Senator Spindler's first question, there is no reason to believe at this stage that where value for money remains the dominant criterion there would be any significant inhibition imposed by that agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to his other two questions concerning the Bevis committee and offsets, that would depend on how any particular proposals were implemented. In general, Australia's attitude to whether we should join such a procurement code will be essentially on a cost-benefit basis. We will be looking at the costs and benefits for Australia and we are consulting with industry about that at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are pluses and minuses. On the plus side, it is quite possible that signing such a code would give Australian industries enhanced access to markets in which they are now significantly inhibited&mdash;that is, the markets of the people who have signed the code. Many of our companies would get better access. That is an issue we cannot brush aside lightly because there will be jobs for Australians if we win those contracts. That is on the plus side of it. We would also need to judge whether this potential benefit outweighs any constraint that joining the code might impose. Those are the factors we are weighing up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's procurement policies were set out in the white paper. In essence, the government is restructuring its purchasing framework to use its capacity as a major purchaser of goods and services to promote the development of Australian industry strategically, without compromising on quality or price, whilst still ensuring value for money for the Australian taxpayer. We think the initiatives in the white paper will make a contribution to increasing domestic economic activity as well as providing the sales and experience in competitive markets that are essential if Australian firms are to win new business on the global stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Already members of the opposition cannot stand to hear more good news for small business. They are already moaning and groaning at the idea that there will be more good information for the small business sector. Yes, Mr President, yesterday the Yellow Pages index&mdash;which has very rapidly in 12 months become a major and credible source of information about small business activity&mdash;released the results of its survey to the end of April. The survey covered over 1,000 small businesses in the metropolitan and regional areas of Australia employing fewer than 20 people in areas covering manufacturing, construction, building, wholesale, retail, finance, property and business services, recreation and personnel&mdash;a very broad based survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey found that employment rose by 2.1 per cent in the period to April compared with a one per cent rise in the three months to January. In fact, the latest figures show that employment has been rising steadily since June last year when the first Yellow Pages index was compiled. This means that a minimum of 65,000 jobs were created in the nine months to April of this year. According to the index economic adviser, Dr Marsden, the combined 3.1 per cent employment growth over the past six months accounted for half the total rise in employment recorded by the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the sales side, one-third of small businesses surveyed recorded significant sales increases to the three months to the end of April 1994&mdash;a significant strengthening on the previous three months. According to Dr Marsden, it was only a year ago that a meagre seven per cent of those surveyed were able to report that their sales had risen. This is a clear indication of a positive turnaround in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weighted average sales increase in the three months to April was 6.1 per cent compared with only 0.6 per cent for the previous period to January. Confidence is also up very strongly. More than 50 per cent of those surveyed say that the economy is growing; around 60 per cent say that the economy will be better a year from now, which of course is very bad news for the opposition, but very good news for Australia; and 75 per cent of small business owners are confident of their own prospects. Profitability continues to be recorded by more small businesses; 39 per cent expect increased sales in the period from May to July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all round, Mr President, the only people in Australia who do not want to hear about this good news for the small business sector are the troglodytes in the opposition who think that any good news is bad news for their political prospects. We also want to point out that Dr Marsden says that the survey also found that there was an expectation that capital expenditure will increase in manufacturing, finance and business services over the next three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the areas about which the opposition has been harping, the survey indicates that there will be business investment&mdash;again, a further good sign for the economy.</PARA>

As I have said on a number of occasions, they do not exist; there are no such joint operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard Senator Chapman make allegations regarding two other so-called related investigations, and his claim that the AFP failed to proceed with investigations in this matter. He raised questions of political interference which, of course, are once again rubbish. Yesterday we saw Senator O'Chee come into this place and raise questions regarding AFP surveillance of prostitution on the Gold Coast and charges being brought against two prostitutes&mdash;charges which he and Senator Boswell in a later press statement indicated quite clearly were state charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to those questions raised yesterday by Senator Chapman, let me say that the answer we have received from the Acting Commissioner of Police in relation to whether the AFP was involved in monitoring a federal politician's dealings with a prostitute on the Gold Coast is that the AFP has not been involved in investigation, monitoring or surveillance of a federal politician on the Gold Coast. There has been no request or requirement to do so and no such activities have been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the other parts of his question&mdash;what action has been taken, has anybody been charged, and whatever&mdash;the AFP has informed us that allegations of prostitution which constitute breaches of state legislation are outside the jurisdiction of the AFP. The AFP has not carried out any such investigations on the Gold Coast and is therefore not in a position to comment in relation to such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a continuation of this smear. What we have in this place with respect to all these questions is an assertion that the Commonwealth's law enforcement agencies are, or have been, involved in directly investigating these matters, which I have said on a number of occasions, on the advice of the AFP, that they are not. We have also had allegations that they should be involved but are not because of alleged political interference. Let me repeat what the Attorney-General said in response to a question from Mr Katter on this matter when this grubby exercise was first embarked on. He said that the article Mr Katter had mentioned referred to an investigation by the Queensland CJC, and he went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activities and investigations of the Queensland CJC are not referred to me, the Minister for Justice or the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me restate what I have said on a number of occasions previously in this place: the AFP and the NCA are not investigating the allegations raised. The AFP and the NCA have advised that the information they have received from the CJC in the course of normal information sharing would not warrant their investigating these matters. Further, the AFP has assured the Minister for Justice that none of the information supplied to it divulges the commission of any Commonwealth offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is time for the opposition to put up or shut up. If the opposition reckons that it has information from the CJC or the Queensland police or some other source which divulges Commonwealth offences, it should put up or shut up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Chapman has in his possession information which he claims might bring down the government, he should hand that over to the AFP and let the real law enforcers pursue these allegations. If those opposite do not have such information, they have an obligation not to pursue this matter. If they do not have anything other than information that the CJC has already shared with the AFP or the NCA, they have no basis for any claim that Commonwealth agencies should be involved in investigating these matters.

I did see the two reports to which Senator Neal refers. We are always pretty keen in this place to criticise the media.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports refer to a 119-member Chinese trade and investment mission which is in Australia to participate in the China trade and investment forums in Melbourne and Sydney. I had the pleasure to open the forum in Melbourne this morning with Vice Minister Gu, who has had meetings with several of my colleagues here and in other places during his visit to this country. He represents the Chinese ministry for foreign trade and economic cooperation. He and I and my colleagues regard this as a very important delegation representing over 80 specially selected Chinese enterprises from regions all around China, both central and regional government and from business in China. Its aim is to attract Australian investment and joint venture participation in diverse areas, including infrastructure, manufacturing, telecommunications, agriculture, services and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Neal pointed out, the delegation is looking for Australian business partnerships to assist in 519 key projects which have been identified in those areas and others. Over 300 Australian firms are taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the Chinese mission to commence or to continue direct negotiations with Chinese businesses. These range from some of the largest Australian companies already engaged in China to small enterprises which are seeking to obtain initial market opportunities in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We greatly welcome the fact that there is such a strong contingent from China. It demonstrates that the government and the business sector in that country are very committed to working with the Australian government and business to develop stronger commercial links. This visit builds on the highly successful Australian business mission to Beijing in September 1993, led by Senator Cook, which made a substantial contribution to the approximately one billion dollars of new investment projects by Australia and China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why this visit cannot do something similar. After all, the value of the 519 projects is, by our assessment, more than $10 billion. Therefore, it is a significant example of government and business working together in Australia&mdash;government making it possible and helping business to make the trade happen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a matter of appreciating that on the income side of the balance of payments account, the overall picture for the net income deficit, which takes into account both the net deficit on profit repatriation together with the net interest that is payable on debt, has fallen from 4.8 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to just 3.6 per cent in 1992-93. The net income deficit&mdash;which includes the figure Senator Kernot is concerned about&mdash;for the first 10 months of 1993-94, the last period for which we have figures, is 1.5 per cent lower than for the same period last year. So when we look at each of these components in their larger context, we can see that they do not give rise to the sorts of concerns the senator spells out. We have to look at these things in the context of their percentage proportion of GDP.

The University of Tasmania has advised that Ms de Blas undertook a study of pollution arising from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co.

She sought to publish her thesis and asked the University of Tasmania to provide indemnity should a legal action arise.

<PARA>I was astounded by the response from Senator Crowley, because she actually headed an inquiry into private health insurance in Australia. She, of all people, should be aware that young people dropping out of the system means that the price of premiums goes up. It is as simple as that. She did not have a clue. That is what it means: as young people drop out, the premiums for those who are still in the system go up. It is a vicious circle. The higher the price, the harder it is for people to take out private health insurance. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To pretend you will not is to ignore the obvious.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley got up this afternoon and said, `It is good for Medicare, people dropping out. We will be able to cope with them.' I say to Senator Crowley that private health insurance is in free fall. Every one per cent that drops out adds $100 million a year to the system. The government must either increase the Medicare levy to cope with that or increase taxation; otherwise its budget is blown out of the water. So something has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to setting up another committee, we have had committees looking into this matter for 11 years. When Minister Howe had responsibility for this portfolio he tried to introduce co-payment. Senator Crowley led the charge to change the mind of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on that issue, and she succeeded. What has happened? Every time the premiums go up, people drop out of private health insurance. It could well be said that it is because of the recession, that people have not got the money, and that is true in part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does Senator Crowley realise that 30 per cent of the population now have health care cards? There are 9,757,424 people out of our total population of 17 1/2 million on income support payments. And she says that is good. She says that is the solution. She admitted that these young people would be dependent on Medicare if they needed treatment. Has Senator Crowley forgotten about the babies with birth injuries, the youth who are suiciding, the number involved in accidents who have to access the health care system? They constitute a large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 11 years of Labor, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. Presently, the poorest 40 per cent control only nine per cent of the nation's wealth, whereas when those opposite came into government they controlled 22 per cent of the wealth. When those opposite came into government, 77 per cent of the population were covered by private health insurance; that figure is now down to 38 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that is happening is the ageing of the population. In six years, one in seven will be over the age of 65, and it is the over-65s who incur most of the health care costs. In fact, two-thirds of health care expenditure goes on people over the age of 65, and one in seven will be in that category in six years time. What is the government doing about this? It is forming another committee to look at it. As Senator Crowley said this afternoon,`We will be reviewing it. We will be looking at it. We will be forming another committee. We will be the mirror people, looking into it again so that we can see ourselves coming out the other side.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the issue of technology. Senator Cooney is well aware of the magnificent technology that is now available and from which many benefit. One of the commonest procedures nowadays is coronary bypass surgery, and that is adding to the cost. What is Senator Crowley going to do about technology? She says, `We are going to look at it so that we can see the problems.' I hope the honourable senator's ignorance might be helped by my contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too was amazed at Senator Crowley's lack of comprehension and compassion in view of the crisis in the health care system. The real point of Senator Crowley's answer was that there is no crisis. Surely no sensible person in this country thinks there is no crisis facing Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crisis is on two fronts. Senator Crowley could find out one of them by talking to people on waiting lists&mdash;people sometimes waiting two or three years for important, in some cases life-saving, surgery. For the bypass procedures Senator Herron referred to there are waiting lists of four or five months in some hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the crisis is financial. When people drop out of private health insurance it means that those same people will not be putting their own money into the health system. Something like $100 million a year will not go into the system if the figures released yesterday are maintained. The Medicare system is now down $100 million a year; but on top of that we have to look after from the public purse those people who have dropped out of the private health system. The rough estimate is that it will cost Medicare something like $600 per person per day over an average year&mdash;or one bed per day per year. With half a million people opting out of private health insurance, which is what yesterday's figures show, the public system will have to find another $300 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will the government do? Will it put the Medicare levy up again? How much higher can it be put? It is already a tax under another name, a burden, particularly on the lower paid. This is a tax of which the government should be thoroughly ashamed. There is a crisis. No matter where we look&mdash;be it the newspapers or the government's own reports&mdash;there is evidence of a crisis of terrible proportions. Where is the money to support the system going to come from? Will it come from more taxes? Will it come from an increase in the Medicare levy? Or will it come from where it should come from&mdash;by encouraging people to put their own money into the health system? That is the only sensible approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have much time for former Senator Richardson, wherever he might spend his spare time, but I have to say that he faced up to the reality of this problem. Unlike his predecessor and unlike the new minister, he appreciated that there was a crisis and that the only way to avoid the crisis and resolve it was to get individuals to put their own money into the system and look after themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister scoffed at the fact that, as she put it, it was the younger, relatively fit people who were dropping out. Surely the minister must realise that, when they drop out, the cost of looking after the older, sicker people who are left goes up, which means that premiums go up. Of course, as soon  as premiums go up, more people drop out. It is a downward spiral. Unless we introduce a circuit-breaker by giving people incentives to take out private health insurance, the position will never be resolved. We must have financial incentives to make sure it is cheaper. We have to give good adequate cover and we have to make sure that people get better service for their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his credit, former Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;and I do not often say this&mdash;had the right idea, but it seems to have gone by the board. What have we now? We have another wretched inquiry. How many more inquiries are we going to have? We must be short of people to run inquiries, when we look at the things that have been going on over the last few years. It is a joke for the minister to pretend that there is any activity about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also complained that, as she put it, the doctors vetoed the treatment of public hospital patients in private hospitals. The reason for that is very sensible. If we have a public hospital patient and he can get treatment in a private hospital for free, why on earth would he consider taking out private health insurance? The end result is fewer people taking out private health insurance; more people on the public payroll on Medicare; and $100,000 here and $100,000 there. It essentially means that the public purse has to bear the burden and the private hospital system keeps on going, as Senator Herron put it, in a free fall. </PARA>

If the young and healthy come out of private insurance they are not likely to be a burden on the public sector, which was the point I was making.

There are two main reasons: one is that when they get the bill&mdash;and thousands of Senator Woods' constituents must have told him that, as they have told me&mdash;they say, `I have had private insurance for 30 years. Now when I finally use it I have got a bill for $3,000 or $4,000 that I cannot pay.' This occurs because the private insurance allows&mdash;and it is the only place that does allow this&mdash;doctors to charge above the schedule fee.

That is precisely what Senator Herron and Senator Woods argue that we should not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bishop has not been the shadow minister for health for more than three minutes but she is barracking for gap insurance.

We know that quite a few doctors do that. Who but the private insurance funds is going to pay the gap insurance? What will that do? It will put up the price of insurance.

<PARA>Two years ago my local newsagent came to see me about an old lady who had been coming into the newsagency for about seven years. Over that period she had experienced arthritis in her hip. It got to the point where she could only just walk with the aid of a frame, and she struggled down to the newsagency. He said to her, `Why don't you get something done about it?' She said, `I have been on a waiting list.' That waiting list has been shortened since the Liberal government has been in office in Victoria. The newsagent said to me, `Is there anything you can do about it?'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley forgets&mdash;she has finally admitted this now although she did not do so when answering the question&mdash;that the price of private health insurance is pushed up by young people leaving the private health system because the people who remain are more likely to use it. Young people who suffer injury, perhaps as a result of an accident on the football field, or illness, are likely to require acute care. Those who have left the private system will go straight into the public health system. What will happen to an older person needing a hip replacement or a cataract operation? That person will be pushed further back down the line to wait. So, every young person who does not have private health insurance and has a need for acute care will go into the public system and will take up a place that could be used by an older person.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) has just tabled the various corrigenda to the portfolio budget measures statements relating to a range of government departments. The reason for the budget statements in the first place relates to the government's economic policy, and in particular, flows through that to the government's bottom line on its figuring&mdash;the budget deficit. That is an issue that is of considerable importance at the present time and is very highly relevant to the figures that were released today, the national accounts results for the March quarter of this financial year and which, as I understand it&mdash;although I did not see the press conference&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described as `profoundly significant' results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I welcome the growth that was recorded in the March quarter figures that were released today, but when I come to look at the Prime Minister's description of them as being profoundly significant, I would use those terms in quite the opposite sense from the way the Prime Minister used them. If we look at the facts behind today's national account figures&mdash;and I am sure Senator Watson agrees with me&mdash;we find some results that are profoundly significant because they are quite disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results for the March quarter showed an increase in average gross domestic product of 1.9 per cent. As I said, that is a good figure but it is the underlying figures that are important. I point out in referring to the 1.9 per cent that on trend estimates the figure is only 1.2 per cent. It is the composition of the figure that is all important. So far as the contribution to that 1.9 per cent is concerned, government consumption made up 1.2 per cent of that 1.9 per cent. In other words, well over half the increase occurred through government consumption. Private consumption was a contribution of only 0.8 per cent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Schacht" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is only to be expected, coming out of a recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the government had been trumpeting the fact that economic recovery was under way and that it was the private sector that was really lifting everything off. We find that government consumption has contributed 1.2 per cent of the 1.9 per cent and private consumption, consumption by ordinary Australians, was only 0.8 per cent. In other words, the government's pump priming contribution to growth was half as much again as consumption by ordinary Australians. That is significant, in its own right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also profoundly significant&mdash;and I use the term `profoundly disturbing'&mdash;are the figures in relation to business investment, because it is business investment which is the engine of growth, job and income creation, and living standards in this country. Business investment in the March quarter contributed 0.4 per cent to the 1.9 per cent growth in GDP&mdash;only about one-fifth of the growth that occurred in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there was no real growth where it really counts, in the private sector. Business investment languished&mdash;and I will come to more detailed figures in a moment&mdash;and private consumption was exceeded by government consumption by half as much again. Let us look at the business investment contribution of 0.4 per cent. The actual growth in business investment in the March quarter, according to the statistics, was 4.4 per cent. On the face of it, that does not look all that bad; but, when we look at the trend figures for investment, far from an increase, there is a decrease of 0.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So business investment, on trend, fell in the March quarter. Even if we accept the 4.4 per cent, when we look at the composition we find that investment in private new equipment, which is really the fundamental part of private sector investment, fell by 6.8 per cent. It was only the purchase of the Gladstone power station from the Queensland government which, in itself, is just a total transfer&mdash;at a very extensive investment figure of $700 million plus&mdash;that provided any increase at all in the published statistics for investment in the quarter. That has to be discounted in a meaningful sense because it is a complete distortion of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business investment outcome figures for the March quarter are not good&mdash;I would say they are bad. There are no signs at all of any sizeable or sustainable increase. Again, to use the Prime Minister's words, that is `profoundly significant', but I use that term in completely the opposite sense to which the Prime Minister used it today. Without investment there can be no lasting economic growth, no new jobs, no improvement in living standards, and no hope for the millions of Australians who are still suffering from the hardships of the government's record of abject failure in managing the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other statistic today in the national accounts figures that is profoundly significant and profoundly disturbing is the savings figure. According to the government's own figures released today, household savings in the March quarter fell to 3 1/2 per cent of household disposable income. That is the lowest figure for household savings that has ever been recorded. It is just one-third of the savings rate that existed when this government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that with negligible savings and continuing disastrous private investment outcomes there is increasing concern in wide sections of the community&mdash;and now it seems within the government's own ranks&mdash;about Australia's foreign debt mountain. On a per capita basis it is far and away the largest of any country on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a debt now of more than $200,000 million&mdash;an absolutely mind boggling figure. There are so many noughts that people just do not comprehend it. It is seven times higher than it was when Labor came to government. It is no wonder the community is concerned about the $18,000 million we pay foreigners each year in interest payments before we start paying off any of the $210 billion in debt. We pay $18 billion just in interest. We are paying that interest on an ever-increasing debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if interest rates had not fallen internationally in the way they have in the last year or so, the figure would be even higher than $18 billion. It will be even higher in the future for two reasons: firstly, interest rates are going up again around the world, so we will be paying higher interest rates on our borrowings; and, secondly, our debt is getting bigger, so we will be paying interest on a higher level of debt. They are matters of great concern because they determine the future wellbeing of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those figures show us very clearly is that we are going down the drain day by day, week by week, month by month and year by year because we are not able to pay our way in the world. It is no wonder that Australians are so profoundly and rightly concerned that interest rates are about to rise again. This government has deliberately chosen to pursue a policy which again puts at risk Australian families' homes, their businesses and their jobs. It is no wonder that the community is concerned that the government has not learnt from its tragic record of boom-bust that has cost all Australians so dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to have forgotten the warnings given to it by the Treasury and contained in its own budget documents presented to the parliament just three weeks ago. The Treasury warned in chilling fashion, very clear, very stark that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The build-up of external debt during the 1980's has almost certainly imposed costs on the economy, including through increased interest rates and greater vulnerability to external shocks.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer than that. The government's policies have put Australia in a very fragile situation. The coalition has been asking the government for years, and not getting a meaningful response at all: why has the government  deliberately chosen to embark on a policy course that has so undermined Australia's economy and, through that, its sovereignty and independence&mdash;because nothing can be more of a determinant of a nation's independence than its economic place in the world&mdash;and left us so dangerously exposed to the boom-bust economic cycles of the past?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We read in today's papers that the Prime Minister told his caucus yesterday, `Don't worry. That foreign debt isn't all that bad. You don't really have to worry about it. We are going to produce a paper that will explain it all,' and that will wish it all away. Does the Prime Minister seriously expect that a paper on debt, drafted by compliant advisers in his own offices and the personal offices of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), will, like some Canute, hold back the flood of legitimate concerns about these fundamental issues? The answer quite clearly is that that is not the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Walsh, the former finance minister, used to talk about the Australian Democrats as the fairies at the bottom of the garden, and he was right, somewhat surprisingly. But he withdrew that criticism of them in recent months. I think he passed the epithet across to the Western Australian Greens. What he should have done was pass it to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the government of this country. Because if the Labor Party believes that the policy it is deliberately pursuing to run this country into ever increasing debt and ever increasing loss of independence and sovereignty is the way to go, then of all the parties in this land the Labor Party is the fairies-at-the-bottom-of-the-garden party. The great cost and tragedy is that every Australian will be the loser as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use this occasion of the presentation of the corrigenda to the portfolio budget measures statements 1994-95 to address the Senate on a number of disturbing measures. I remind the Senate that never before has an opposition been denied the opportunity, as it was in the budget in May this year, of being allowed to bring its expert advisers into the lock-up. Not only that, but we who were in there noted that the index of the budget papers, particularly document No. 1, bore no relation to the contents. I know that the professionalism of Treasury would not have allowed such errors. It points to the fact that there were a lot of last minute political changes to that document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to take issue with the statement made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, in the Senate this afternoon when he asserted that the wider Australian community does not share the burden of its foreign debt because in those budget documents that I referred to the Treasury itself said something quite different. Who is right? I back my case on the Treasury officers, because their assertion is based on facts and learning, and an understanding of the issue. Was the minister at the time not aware of the decline in the living standards of Australia, a decline attributable to the policies pursued by this government during its term in office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that interest rates went through the roof arising from the recession that this government said Australia had to have, and companies are only now crawling out of that recessionary process. What is the government doing? It is restructuring the debt under great difficulty as things get just a little bit better from that recession that we had to have. Those policies were directly attributable to the rise in the interest rates, and as interest rates moved, what did the private and the corporate sector do? They were forced by sheer necessity to seek their funding and financing overseas. So it is not surprising that the debt increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot walk away from that responsibility and attempt to blame the private sector for the huge increase in private debt. It has gone from a figure of $34 billion gross to over $210 billion under this Labor government. This is a legacy that the Australian people at large have to carry in the form of lower standards of living. Because interest rates are very much higher, and because we are so locked into the international community because of the extent of our borrowing, we are now captive to the movers and shakers of international monetary movements around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we have political independence if we have not got economic independence? We are losing our economic independence because we are locked into the decisions of what is happening around the world. No matter what Mr Bernie Fraser might say about interest rates; if, around the world, interest rates are firming they must firm in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some discussion of when interest rates are about to rise. Those of us who have overdrafts at the present time are aware that interest rates are rising. While it might be true to say that the base rate of 9.25 per cent has not risen yet but it may in the future, that ignores the fact that individual banks are raising their risk margins across the board. That is a de facto interest rate rise, because instead of paying something like 10 or 11 per cent the figure is now probably up to 12 per cent. That is a real rise that is happening here and now at a time when the Treasurer is denying that, as yet, there have been any interest rate rises. It demonstrates that this government is out of touch with what is happening in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are coming out of the recession that Australia had to have. I was speaking to some small businessmen in Queanbeyan who are still recovering from the recession. What are they doing? They are trying to restructure their debt in the hope of trying to hang on. At the end of the December quarter 1993 the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing the international investment position in ABS document 5306.0 showed gross foreign debt to be $210 billion, of which $96 billion was in the public sector. This approximates $5,300 for every man, woman and child in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debt includes debt held by Commonwealth and state governments and by their semi-government authorities. The public sector share of gross foreign debt is currently 46 per cent. There can be no argument that the public sector debt is not a burden on the public or on the community. Yet this afternoon this government denied that. Through its ownership of the government, the public does bear the burden through the taxation system to repay public sector debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if it is argued that Australia's foreign debt is different to that of the developing world in that our foreign debt is mainly private sector debt, the Australian community can still be said to bear this burden, although perhaps not as directly as in the case of public sector debt. But a debt does get reflected in higher interest rates and lower standards of living. We all know from personal experience that as the mortgage goes up we have to contribute more in repayments and our standard of living drops because we have less money to spend on other goods, services and needed things. The same is true of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logic behind this is that whilst owners and shareholders of companies bear the burden of their overseas debt, Australia's private sector is large and widespread. This means that all Australians have a de facto involvement in bearing the private sector debt since we are all involved in the economy and, as the employees of the owners and managers, we contribute to their profits and hence their ability to repay those debts. This is another example where the burden of private sector debt cannot be said to lie on owners and shareholders only: the community, both indirectly and directly, is burdened in some way too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument is that the growth of foreign debt helps to drive down the value of the Australian dollar in the foreign exchange market. This is yet another mechanism by which the community at large bears the foreign debt. It bears the burden of the foreign debt indirectly since the lower value of the dollar tends to reduce the purchasing power of the dollar and causes lower living standards resulting from things such as higher import prices. Of course, as the value of the dollar drops, we find an increase in the ultimate indebtedness to the worldwide community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I put to you that we are very much in the hands of the international money market at the present time. We are captive to it. As interest rates rise overseas, so too will they rise in Australia. But we are much worse off because of the other factors which internally will create rises for people who have to repay mortgages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly support the comments made by Senator Short and Senator Watson today in the debate on these documents. In this country we see foreign debt totally out of control. When I came into this parliament four years ago I came from a bank that specialised in Latin American debt. I am now in a parliament which seems to specialise in debt of Latin American proportions. We see that this government has no measure in its economic strategy which will deal with the burden of foreign debt. Foreign debt will be a burden not just on this generation of Australians but on succeeding generations of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other opposition senators, I was shocked to hear Senator Evans say in the parliament today that there was no reason for concern over the foreign debt because, he told us, it was buying assets that would produce a return that would pay the interest. This is a variation on the argument we heard from Senator Button, that there is no need to worry because we can pay the interest. Of course, there is no proof that these assets can pay the interest; in fact, there is every reason for us to believe that the Australian population is being asked to swallow exactly the same excuses as were offered in Brazil, Argentina and other Latin American countries when everybody there believed, without any dissent, that they would be capable of paying the interest on the debt. One day they all woke up and realised that they could not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to kick the public off the foreign debt serpent, and that is exactly what it is. It is a serpent that will come around to swallow the Australian economy. Our net foreign liabilities are now in the vicinity of 57 per cent to 58 per cent of GDP if we believe the figures in the budget. The disturbing thing is that this year alone the Australian economy will bleed&mdash;and `bleed' is the word&mdash;$18 billion in interest payments on the $200 billion of debt which we have clocked up. Of course, we could just add those interest payments to the foreign debt we will have at the end of the year because the Australian economy, whilst running a balance of payments deficit, will ultimately be incapable of paying that interest, so much of it will be rolled over in the same way in which this government, which is bankrupt morally and financially, is having to roll over its own debt. And so it piles up and up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson made some very perspicacious comments in relation to our sovereignty. Our sovereignty is at risk from this foreign debt. We should look at the debt legacy that the Victorian government was left with as a result of Cain and Kirner destroying the economy of that state. We saw the Premier of Victoria having to go on bended knee to the bankers in New York to plead for the debt rating of his state. Whenever one is so beholden to other lenders, or so beholden to the credit rating agencies which ultimately determine one's interest rate&mdash;because if they do not like you they downgrade your debt, and when the debt is downgraded the interest payments go up&mdash;one does not have the freedom to run the economic policy one wants. The economic policy is run the way they want, or the debt is downgraded. This is the danger facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wholly unacceptable for the government to say, `Look, the private sector has gone and borrowed this money.' Of course the private sector went and borrowed the money. The private sector had to go offshore because the savings base in this country has dwindled away to nothing. If there is to be an investment recovery whilst this government takes $20.4 billion this year out of the money market through its public sector borrowing requirement, there will be an increasing tendency for borrowers to go offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the government saying, `Look, we will borrow $20.4 billion this year' at the same time expecting business to increase its investment over 16 per cent and take the money for investment from the same pool that the government is robbing with the public sector borrowing requirement and its three- to 10-year bond raisings. It is obvious that that money will be found offshore if it is to be found at all. Either the government will be very short on its budget estimates, or the estimates will be met through massive increases in foreign borrowings. Neither is acceptable to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it is the private sector or the public sector that is responsible for the particular loans in question, the government has culpability over both hands. The government has culpability over all of them, because all the people on that side are morally bankrupt when it comes to running the country's economy. What we will see increasingly is the decisions on our economy, our future, our social programs, our programs for development, not being determined here in Canberra, not even being determined in the boardrooms of Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, but being determined in rooms in other countries on the other side of the world. That is the legacy that Australia has from these years of Labor government&mdash;a legacy of bankruptcy. It ought to rise in the throat of every Australian that this is the truth about the great economic miracle that those people on the other side of the chamber proclaim to us. It is nothing but a fraud and it will come back to haunt succeeding generations of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before this debate was interrupted prior to lunch I was detailing that, although there had been a measure of reform achieved on the Australian waterfront over the last few years, the extent of that reform was inadequate and, in any case, the present government had only been dragged kicking and screaming towards implementing that reform because of the strong advocacy for reform on the part of the opposition and, in particular, the Liberal Party. I went on to say that under the bill we are debating today, we now see a turnaround by the government&mdash;a return to the dark ages of the waterfront; a regime where unions are now dictating policy to the government as a payback for the help the unions gave the government in its campaign to be re-elected in the March 1993 federal election. So we see the government now caving in to the Maritime Union of Australia, which steadfastly refuses to accept that waterfront workers, in line with the rest of the Australian work force, should no longer have a job for life guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steadfast refusal by the Maritime Union of Australia to accept the loss of jobs for life was patently obvious in the recent Australian Stevedores dispute. The MUA continues to believe that stevedoring employees should be entitled to employment rights and conditions which the rest of Australian employees simply do not enjoy. They want privileges that other Australian workers do not enjoy. The newly developing integrity of the Australian waterfront and the productivity gains and benefits that have been made since that reform process began&mdash;albeit, as I said, fairly limited benefits&mdash;even to the extent that they have been obtained, are now seriously jeopardised by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the assertions by the minister that this bill is not aimed at creating labour pools or seeing a move away from enterprise employment, it does precisely that by allowing the maintenance of surplus industry employees in port pools. Further, it destroys the representational balance of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee by the reduction in size of the committee from seven members to four members. In clause 20 of the original bill there was to be inserted section 26A which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee must establish a register containing the names of stevedoring employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the widespread objection to this proposed section 26A insertion not only by the opposition but by those involved in the industry, the minister in the other place subsequently amended clause 20 by adding the following additional subsection:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Committee is satisfied that an employer of stevedoring employees is keeping the prescribed records in relation to those employees, the Committee is not required to include the names of those employees on the register.</PARA>

The existence of a register reintroduces an industry arrangement which is out of step with the government's own legislation for enterprise bargaining and, indeed, the government's own requirement that industry based arrangements in the stevedoring industry be rescinded by the end of October 1992&mdash;18 months or so ago.

In 1991 the pools had large surpluses of employees in ports and cost the stevedoring industry in excess of $2 million a month to pay employees whether or not they worked. Whether they were actually producing anything, whether they were actually contributing to the wealth of this country, the stevedoring employees were still up for $2 million a month. It is no wonder this country has difficulty competing on overseas markets when our exporters are burdened with that sort of cost structure. It is ludicrous that this government is prepared to agree to the demands of the Maritime Union of Australia and return to the situation which the industry and the Australian taxpayer spent $420 million and three years to remove.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's excuse for introducing this legislation is to ensure conformity with International Labour Organisation convention 137. Much has been said in the debate in the other place and in this chamber about this convention&mdash;of binding Australia to international conventions at the expense of national interest and domestic law. Comment has also been made about which countries are signatories and which countries have refused to sign the convention. Of course, there is absolutely no reason why Australia cannot denounce ILO convention 137 this year at the completion of its second decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise that the relevance of this particular convention has long since lapsed. So to place this legislation before the parliament on the basis of arguing that we are doing it to conform with an obsolete, irrelevant convention from which this country ought to withdraw, anyway, is merely a smokescreen for the real intention of this Labor government, dominated as it is by its union masters. Of course, the real intention of this legislation is to placate the truculence of the Maritime Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be pressing to increase the pace of reform on the waterfront. Instead, it is bringing in detrimental legislation which turns the clock back to the bad old days on the waterfront, just as the Industrial Relations Reform Act&mdash;which it passed last year and which came into operation a couple of months ago&mdash;did for industrial relations generally. In the last couple of days we have seen a backdown from the minister on that aspect of that Industrial Relations Reform Act relating to unfair dismissal. It was not a sufficient backdown or change but at least it was an acknowledgment that the legislation was faulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, the government was in absolute agreement with what the opposition put to this chamber at the end of last year in the debate on that legislation.

We pointed out that employers would not be prepared to take on new employees because of the consequences that would flow from the unfair dismissal part of the legislation if, for any future reason, they needed to retrench people.

We need a quicker pace of reform in stevedoring than we have had in the past, yet, because of this legislation, we will see the pace of that reform slow down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That simply mirrors what this federal government is doing with regard to industrial relations practice in the broad. It mouths platitudes about wanting to see more enterprise agreements and a better structure for industrial relations but the legislation it brings into this place mitigates against that goal. That was most notably the case with the misnamed Industrial Relations Reform Act of 1993. It came into effect only a couple of months ago but in the last few days we have already seen some slight backing down in relation to its requirements on unfair dismissals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government is fair dinkum about getting a decent industrial relations structure in place in this country and introducing serious reform so that employers and employees can get together and establish their mutual interests and work together towards the benefit of the enterprise and for their own individual benefits it would repeal the 1993 act altogether. The government would introduce some genuine industrial relations reform that the Liberal and National parties have advocated for virtually a decade. It is because of that advocacy that we see some very minor changes to industrial relations, but nowhere near adequate for what is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only should we not pass this legislation, but the government ought to repeal the Industrial Relations Reform Act so that we can get a genuine structure for enterprise agreements in place. In the last few days we have seen that the legislation that is in place is mitigating against a genuine structure because the government has announced a program of grants to encourage people to enter into enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 legislation was heralded by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, and the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, as legislation that was going to ensure that enterprise agreements would break out all over Australia. However, it is that very legislation that has mitigated against these agreements being developed. The government has to introduce a scheme of bribery to try and get some enterprise agreements in place so that it can present a perception that its legislation is working when clearly it is failing. That underlines the failure of this government in the administration of industrial relations. This failure operates to the detriment of the Australian people and the Australian economy because it prevents Australia being as productive as it otherwise would be in the areas of wealth creation, building exports, competing with our trading partners and providing a better standard of living for all Australians. This legislation should not proceed, and the Industrial Relations Reform Act ought to be repealed and torn up and the government should start again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief comments on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994, particularly as it relates to young Australians. One of the features of 1994, as we see Australia coming out of a deep and unnecessary recession, is that whole groups of Australians are being locked out of the benefits of the upsurge in economic growth. One group worst affected is young Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, I heard my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator O'Chee mention that the massive foreign debt with which Australia is burdened will fall on future generations of Australians. One of the future generations closest at hand is young Australians who are presently in high school or in their early days at university&mdash;Australian youth, an area for which I have shadow ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations legislation came through this place in a marathon debate in 1993. It has already been amended here and more amendments have been flagged this week. This legislation freezes out young Australians from being able to benefit from any growth that occurs in employment. That growth is very low, but because of the government's incredibly close relationship with the trade unions and organised unions it is prepared to freeze these young Australians out by bringing in a whole lot of onerous provisions in industrial laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the Senate to understand that young Australians do not have a lot of bargaining power. They are not an organised part of the work force. They are virtually insignificant to people like Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson and the bosses of such big unions as the Transport Workers Union. We do not see those people worrying too much in union elections about 15-, 16- and 17-year olds. These young people are unorganised, are not well represented, and are being frozen out of an Australia that is more and more becoming a country where, if one does not have a bargaining table when it comes to things like native title, the budget, and industrial relations, one does not get a slice of the pie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, young Australians are missing out. The government would argue that the massively high levels of youth unemployment will be addressed by the white paper. After the white paper was brought down reporters and cameras from virtually every television station in the country went out into the streets and young unemployed Australians were bailed up and asked, `What do you think the white paper will do for your employment prospects?' I do not profess to have seen every piece of television coverage of the white paper or Working Nation statement, but virtually all the people I saw said, `It won't help me. It might give me a bit of extra training. It might give me a training base. But at the end of it I want a real job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most young Australians want the same sort of security that their parents enjoyed. They want the opportunity to get well educated, to make their own choices in life, to one day buy a home and to move about the place in an aeroplane, a motor vehicle, a bus, or on a boat. Young people want to be able to make those choices. They realise that training schemes&mdash;no matter how important they are in the short term&mdash;do not offer them the opportunity to have a real job and to be able to build up their financial security and self-esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people are extremely cynical about the white paper and the Working Nation statement. They have been promised a lot before but nothing has been delivered. The government should not just see that as the cynicism of youth, but rather as a deep and endemic problem in Australian society. Hundreds of thousands of Australian youth have lost hope in this government and in the future of Australia. It is incumbent on the Liberal and National party opposition to rebuild some of that hope. I expect that under the leadership of Mr Downer and Mr Costello we will be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In state elections in the last couple of years masses of young Australians have turned to the Liberal and National parties and have voted for us. The Tasmanian by-election sticks in my mind. Some 54 per cent of young Australians voted for the Liberal Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for all of us who are moving into middle age not to have to worry about foreign debt. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Gareth Evans) said here in question time, we do not have to worry about the foreign debt, `It'll all be okay.' The reality is, maybe he does not have to worry; he is getting on in life. It is the young people who will have to worry about these things, like the failure of the industrial relations system. It is the young people who need the jobs; they are the people who want to get their feet on the first rung of the employment ladder&mdash;the rung that is being chopped off by Mr Brereton in his industrial relations bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the young people who will have to bear the burden of taxation as they move into the work force. They are the ones who will have to bear the cost of education, health and social security. This generation is failing to build a public policy that deals with all those costs. We are basically saying, `We will not worry about it. We will hand it on to the next generation.' That next generation is at school at the moment or is just entering university. There is a massive group of young Australians in that 16- to 25-year-old age group who are very worried about the future and who are very cynical about this government. If we are honest, they are probably cynical about all politicians. We owe them a lot more. The Liberal-National party coalition must really work to ensure that those people do have something to look forward to in their lives. I assure you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the government's approach to industrial relations certainly could not give them any hope whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step that this government could take to ensure that young Australians do have some hope in the future is actually to repeal Mr Brereton's legislation of last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us not encourage them, Madam Acting Deputy President. I have not had the opportunity, of course, to hear all the second reading debate. I heard several of the contributions and I think I got the thrust of some of the others. In the main, they strayed a very long way from the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill because they sought to revisit their unsuccessful opposition to the industrial relations reform legislation of last year in which I was significantly involved. A number of other detailed references would more appropriately be dealt with by Senator Robert Ray when he deals with the bill in the committee stage, so I will not reiterate and revisit those. It might be useful, given that the debate has ranged so widely and so far away from what is actually proposed in this bill, to deal with some of the fundamental points about what is, in fact, a straightforward piece of legislation, the purposes of which are clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill ensures the collection of a levy which partially finances the redundancy program initiated through the waterfront reform process; simplifies the levy collection legislation framework; pares the committee and removes redundant provisions; and assists in maintaining Australia's commitment to ILO convention 137 through a simple provision for a register which will impact only on those employers who do not maintain appropriate employee records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of comments have been made about the register. As I say, in the main, they are ones that might be best dealt with in the committee stage if people pursue them because they relate to relevant clauses of the bill and they are somewhat more detailed than I would expect to deal with in the summing up at the end of a second reading debate.

The Bureau of Industry Economics has reported that Australian container handling performance has joined the league of similar sized overseas ports. It is true that it may fall short of the performance of some of the very high volume international ports such as Singapore and Rotterdam; but when compared with like countries the result is comparable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics also noted that the operating efficiency of Australian coal and grain handling is at world best practice level. Of course, the Senate will pardon me for interpolating as trade minister how significant I believe that to be. It is clear, in the markets of the world, that our capacity to efficiently handle the major bulk commodity vessels through our ports is a significant export plus for us. It makes us very competitive in many markets of the world, provided they have the ports to accommodate the vessels we are sending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable senators spoke at length about the legislation and some of them waxed very eloquent, even when I was here. Some of the assertions they threw around as if they were facts were quite a long way from the truth. I do not have time to go through all the things that Senator Chapman got wrong. His speech seemed to be as far from reality as Senator Bolkus suggested his questions were today and on other occasions. It was almost as good as the dog at the Lodge. I thought his speech was about as significant a contribution to public policy as that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he did quite clearly get several facts wrong about whether the bill will create a labour pool or not. He seemed to assert that it would, and that is just not the case. He thought the committee would be dominated by the union. In the debate in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), gave an assurance that that was not what the bill would lead to. And it does not seem, on the face of it, that the structure of the committee would lend itself to that outcome with one representative of employees on the committee. Other than absolute anti-union paranoia, I do not understand what criteria would judge that this would lead to that outcome. </PARA>

<PARA>There is a very important distinction between this amendment and what is contained in the bill. As far as forming a committee under statute is concerned, we say that  organisations&mdash;whether they be union or employer organisations, or the group of stevedoring employers in this particular case who are represented by an organisation&mdash;have the simple right to nominate the individuals who will serve on this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend a little time on this point. While we have committees that are appointed wholly and solely by a minister, the end result is cosy committees with ministerial mates appointed to them. We can look back through the records of many years and see many situations where this has happened. When an organisation&mdash;whether it be a union, an employer or some other body&mdash;is required by the government to serve in such a capacity, at the very least it should have the right to nominate who it sees as the best person for the job. That is crucial to the success of advisory committees to governments. In this particular case we find that that is not the government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will be selecting not only the chairperson and the officer of the department, but also the person representing the employers and the person representing the stevedoring employees. In the past, that has not led to having the best people for the job on statutory committees. I put it to Senator Bell&mdash;and although we do not have Senator Harradine here or Senator Chamarette who spoke on the bill for some time earlier, I put it to them as well&mdash;that it is a very important fundamental principle to get the best people to produce the best results in their advisory functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are on this point, I refer to the point made by Senator Margetts earlier. She criticised the coalition and the government, and probably Senator Bell, for not giving enough consideration to the point of view of maritime unions or the people who work on the waterfront. This is her opportunity to allow democracy to work by voting for our amendment and allowing the maritime unions to select the person that they want to serve on the committee. I say to the minister at the table, Senator Robert Ray&mdash;who often in this place and quite correctly defends democracy and its importance&mdash;and to the government and to Senator Bell, that this is not democracy at work; it is the selection of a mate to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can almost guarantee that if the organisations involved were given the opportunity to nominate people they would not be the same nominations as those of the minister. I cannot emphasise strongly enough in establishing the fundamental principle not only for this legislation but also for future legislation that organisations&mdash;whether they be employer organisations, unions, the ACTU, voluntary organisations or service industries&mdash;should have the right, when serving in this capacity under statute, to nominate who they believe is the best person for the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this amendment moved by my colleague Senator Crane on behalf of the opposition is to ensure that the legislation works as the minister&mdash;particularly the responsible minister in the other place, Mr Brereton&mdash;has said it will work. We want to make sure it will work in that way, because as it is drafted it may not necessarily work in that way in relation to the four members who make up the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. As the legislation is drafted, the four members will be appointed by the minister: the chairperson is appointed by the minister; an officer of the department is appointed by the minister; a representative of the stevedoring employers is appointed by the minister; and a representative of the stevedoring employees is appointed by the minister.

As we are aware, there is a business called Federated Stevedores which is a union-run stevedoring organisation. It could purport to be one of the employers, have a representative appointed to this committee by a minister, and through that backdoor method have another representative of the Maritime Union of Australia appointed. The minister says that that will not happen, and we have to take the current minister at face value. But who is to say that a future minister might not do something different and use this backdoor method to ensure that this committee is absolutely dominated by the unions and by people favourable to the unions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairperson could be favourable to the union; the departmental employee appointed by the minister could be favourable to the union; the union representative obviously would be favourable to the union; and through the possibility of this backdoor appointment of having a not genuine stevedoring employers' representative, the fourth member of the committee could be beholden to the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply want to ensure that what the minister says will happen will happen because the legislation is drafted that way. Senator Crane has moved this amendment to clause 9 to ensure that, of the four people, there is still a chairman and an officer of the department which the minister might appoint. But the person representing the Maritime Union of Australia is appointed on the nomination of that union, and the person representing the stevedoring employers is appointed on the nomination of those stevedoring employers. It is not left to the discretion of the minister. Then there will be absolutely no doubt that, in the future, this committee will be a balanced committee and it will act with appropriate concern and consideration of the interests of all people involved in this industry. There will not be the opportunity in the future, notwithstanding the minister's present assurances, for a backdoor method of ensuring absolute union domination of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, notwithstanding the points that Senator Bell has put, there is a real concern about the possibility of the structure of this committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make another couple of remarks in response to the minister, and I note his comment that this is where the matter rests. It is interesting to note that the waterfront industry reform process has been achieved&mdash;we have pointed out in our second reading speeches that it has a long way to go&mdash;through cooperation between the employers on the one hand and the employees on the waterfront or their organisations on the other hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that, having reached the point we are now at in terms of waterfront reform, the minister can even suggest that those organisations have lost their capacity all of a sudden to come up with good people, the right people, to finalise and finish this particular task. I find that an extraordinary statement. Of course, we now have in legislation a situation where those people appointed to that position could end up not having a direct link with the stevedoring employees or with the employers on the waterfront. That is the situation we could end up with with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister and Mr Brereton might give an assurance that that is not going to happen. The fact that the possibility is there and ministers do change make it bad legislation. It is as simple as that. It makes it bad legislation. I wanted to put that point on the record because the starting point for getting the best result is good legislation. </PARA>

With 15 months to run, I think it is a bit of a long bow he is now starting to pull on this issue as though there will be a change of ministers, for some reason a purge of the board and then, as it is in its last few months, there will be the big stacking exercise to achieve what?

<PARA>I dealt with this amendment in my remarks on the second reading. Therefore I will not dwell on it now. Briefly, the purpose of the amendment is to clearly define the committee's role and functions. We seek to ensure that the committee carries out its function and can move to the next function, namely to dismiss itself. We do not wish the committee to take on functions and therefore in that way prolong its own lifetime. Interestingly, this is one of the few occasions in legislation in which a committee is in a position to bring about its own demise. The minister has commented that the committee has only 15 months to run. This begs the question as to how the government will handle aspects of ILO convention 137.

We do not anticipate the need for any new or additional levies, but we do not wish unnecessarily to limit that aspect of the committee's functioning. The committee has tripartite representation and may see a need to make recommendations to the government on a variety of relevant matters during its remaining life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think at one time it was said by the opposition that such provision was linked to the matter of a register and a return to jobs pool. This is without foundation. The amendments to the stevedoring industry legislation proposed in the bill do not signal a return to labour pooling. No pools are envisaged or proposed. For this reason the government does not agree to the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) has said that the government does not envisage any return to pooling or any new levies; indeed, that is what Mr Brereton said in the other place when dealing with this legislation. But neither Mr Brereton nor Senator Ray has given us an absolute guarantee that these things will not take place&mdash;that at some stage there will be new levies and pooling. The only reason for having levies is the existence of a pool. The purpose of levies is to provide the funds to pay those stevedoring employees who are part of a pool during their idle time and not actually working on the waterfront to earn an income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we want in this legislation is an absolute guarantee that there will not be a return to those bad old days of employment pooling, and that there will not be additional levies put on the stevedoring industry which, in turn, are passed on to our exporters. If the government is confident that we are not going to have a return to pooling and we will not need additional levies, why does it not make that commitment clear now by supporting this amendment&mdash;because this amendment will ensure that the committee no longer has the capacity to raise additional levies; and has the capacity to recommend the cessation of levies? That is what we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this reform process is genuine and will reach the conclusion which the government claimed at the outset was envisaged for it, the abolition of levies will be the final stage of that reform process. Until levies are abolished we will not have completed the reform process, so let us use this legislation to complete the process, as it has been achieved thus far, although as I said earlier we need to hasten the pace of achieving enterprise agreements and get rid of the jobs for life concept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose clause 20 on page five. Once again, the debate has basically been run in terms of the contents of the second reading speech; and a number of us paid some attention to it. I re-emphasise the point that we do not see the necessity for the establishment of the register of stevedoring employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated and acknowledged, we support the opposition. In the second reading debate this was flagged and the reasons for supporting the establishment of another register to replace that which this legislation is dismantling were discussed. There was a specious argument that it had something to do with ILO convention No. 137&mdash;and I cannot see the connection&mdash;but history has shown that that is no longer relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that was put up was that it would somehow prevent the increasing casualisation of the work force. In Hobart, of which I have some little knowledge, that process is taking place&mdash;I use the present tense&mdash;in the presence of an existing register. The register at the moment has had little effect on that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech on the second reading, I alluded to the forces which would work against any further increase in casualisation. Those are the most important forces. They recognise that in the past waterfront workers were hired essentially for their muscle and it mattered little which waterfront workers were hired from a large pool. Those days have passed; they have been described in this debate as the `bad old days'. Yet, at present, we have a situation where waterside workers are hired for their skill and capacity to efficiently perform the tasks available; and the muscle power is provided by machines. That is a process which militates against increasing casualisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all sorts of other reasons there may well be an increase to some extent in the numbers of casual employees but it is the skill and efficiency of the work force, an efficiency and skill which is required, which is the waterside workers' best defence against that process, not some mickey mouse register which is proposed to be foisted upon the industry for purposes other than this. It is quite apparent that those purposes are more symbolic and transparent than real. So we will support the opposition and we have not heard any good argument to change our position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">5.30 p.m.&mdash;The maintenance of a register is clearly an industry based arrangement, and yet as far as operations on the waterfront and employment arrangements are concerned, the whole approach to waterfront industry reform is to get away from that industry base and to get to an enterprise or an individual employer base. The government wants to put into this legislation the maintenance of a register, which is a direct return to the industry employment arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is genuine about wanting to proceed further with enterprise arrangements and individual company employment, why are we putting this clause into the legislation? We heard no justification from the minister as to why it was needed other than what we have heard in the other place, which is a justification based on compliance with ILO convention No. 137. Let me remind the Senate that Australia ratified ILO convention No. 137 on 24 June 1974, nearly 20 years ago. We also need to remember that the particular purpose of that convention related to the conversion of the waterfront industry from discrete cargo and bulk cargo handling to container handling on the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cleared that form of cargo handling out of our system years and years ago. Our wharves, as are the wharves of much of the rest of the world, are now containerised in terms of dealing with freight. So ILO convention No. 137 is completely irrelevant to the Australian waterfront. To justify putting this clause into the legislation on the basis that we have to conform with ILO convention No. 137 is an absolute furphy, because that convention is outdated, it does not apply and it is completely unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said during the second reading debate, what we ought to be doing instead of introducing a clause into this legislation to comply with that convention is denouncing the convention, as we are capable of doing every decade. Given that it is about to be the 20th anniversary of our compliance with and ratification of that convention, we have the opportunity to denounce it and, in effect, withdraw from it, because it is no longer relevant. That is what we ought to be doing, not putting into this legislation a clause for the maintenance of a register which purports to be required because we are complying with that outdated convention. In reality, it reinstitutes the register to give the capacity for a return to an industry based arrangement, should the unions demand that as the masters of this government at some stage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to remember that countries as diverse as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, the Argentine and Chile do not comply with convention No. 137. A lot of those countries are our trading competitors and our trading partners and we have got to be as efficient on the waterfront as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us not have this furphy as to what this clause is all about. We ought not to have it in the legislation. Again, I welcome Senator Bell's indication that the Australian Democrats are supporting our opposition to this so that in practice we will remove it from the bill. That is as it ought to be, because it does nothing to further the development of enterprise agreements on the waterfront. In fact, what it does is open up the opportunity for a return to the bad old days. </PARA>

Furthermore, it recognises that reductions in the work force may be necessary as a result of factors affecting the industry, and does not establish unreasonable impediments to such action being taken.

These conventions were not used by the Liberal and National parties as a constitutional battering ram. They were signed after consultation with and the agreement of all parties involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to complete my remarks on this important bill and to respond briefly to some of the remarks made by Senator Bell and Senator Sherry. I was interested in what Senator Bell had to say. I do not always agree with Senator Bell but he makes a sincere and thoughtful contribution to issues in this chamber. To paraphrase him, he said that, whether or not we sign these conventions, they are ultimately issues of law which must come before this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important issue. The effect of signing these conventions is to provide the Commonwealth government with a constitutional head of power. Normally when we wish to change the constitution in this country we have the referendum process. If the people want the balance of power to be changed between the states and Canberra the issue is put to the people in a referendum and they give their view on that particular issue. That has been the Australian tradition. If our constitution means anything, it means that it was voted in by the people and it is the people's constitution. If it is to be changed, it is the people who must change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By slow accretion and degrees over the last 20 years we have seen the increasing use of multilateral treaties, including those with the ILO and the UN. The effect of a government ratifying one of these conventions or articles under our constitution is to give a constitutional head of power. The classic case was convention 158 on which this bill in part depends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our normal constitutional processes, if the government was to acquire a constitutional head of power in this area it would have had to put a referendum to the people. But it did not. It raced off to Geneva and signed a convention. At the end of the day I hope the High Court will pull back from the position that the government and many others interpret as providing them with a constitutional head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something fundamental happens in relation to the signing of a convention. It is possible for a future government from this side of the chamber to develop, encourage or find a convention that may give us very substantial powers over, for example, a closed shop. We would then be able to legislate in the face of many Labor states, perhaps, and overrule what those state governments and many trade unions wanted. So there is great logic to the system which has developed over 90 years in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is that by signing a convention we change the balance of power between the centre and the states. Given the fact that our founders regarded it as a people's constitution&mdash;a constitution voted in by the people&mdash;it was for the people to change the constitution. It was not for the Commonwealth to go off and sign a convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tradition grew up&mdash;and Senator Sherry repeated my comments&mdash;that these conventions could be signed provided that there was full agreement of the states and the major interest groups. This was before the very expansive interpretation that the High Court gave in the dams case in 1982. There was a view around that, provided there was consensus, these conventions could be signed and it was up to the states to bring their laws into line with this convention&mdash;often before they were ultimately ratified. So there was that important check in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Bell I say that signing these conventions is sometimes more than putting a law through the parliament: it is a matter of constitutional importance in this country. I do not think that that can be denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that as a result of the push by some elements in the legal fraternity, the rulings of the various committees associated with the ILO in this case, and the UN in the other, can become incorporated through the judgments of our courts. We have seen this in a number of cases. In Mabo Justice Brennan referred to the fact that the signing of some UN human rights conventions and the use of the first optional protocol meant that the courts would give some credence to international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think that this is a very bad development because it ignores the traditions of this country that if the people want to change the constitution they must be asked to change it by referendum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was surprised to hear some of the comments that were made by Senator Sherry earlier in this debate, and I wholeheartedly endorse the comments that have been made by my colleague Senator Kemp. It is about time that Senator Murphy got a little bit of an introductory course in international law. Senator Sherry said that we had international legal obligations that arose out of the ILO conventions&mdash;an extraordinary comment to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry is under the misapprehension that any time Australia signs another agreement, be it with another country or with an international governmental body, we have a legal obligation similarly as if we had signed a contract. Let me go through that because Senator Sherry is utterly wrong. The Vienna convention on treaties executed in 1969 lays down the basis on which countries may execute treaties and it also lays down the basis on which other bodies may enter international arrangements between themselves or with other governments. Nothing in the Vienna convention on treaties says that, if Australia enters an agreement with the ILO, that is a treaty within the meaning of the Vienna convention. So Senator Sherry is wrong to start off with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we sign an agreement with the ILO or with another international body of a similar nature, under the Vienna convention it is not a treaty. It may well be an agreement. It can be referred to as a treaty, but all sorts of things are referred to as treaties, however, they have no binding international force. They do not have the force of law, and this is the big problem in international law. Any time an agreement is signed, it gets called a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for the benefit of Senator Sherry, I might run through five sample treaties. Senator Sherry can tell me whether they have the force of law as between one nation and another. Senator Sherry fancies himself as a bit of a hot-shot on this subject. Let us see whether Senator Sherry thinks that these agreements, which have been called treaties, have the force of law as between one nation and another. First, the charter of the United Nations; secondly, the Anglo-American liquor convention of 1924 which established mutual recognition of three mile territorial sovereignty; thirdly, the 1916 treaty between Denmark and the US; fourthly, the treaty of Vienna of 1815; and, fifthly, the strategic arms limitation treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all treaties. But do they create uniform obligations in international law? The answer is `no' because in many cases the character of these agreements is that they are expressions of principle; but they do not create a cause of action before the International Court of Justice. They do not create legally binding obligations between one country and another. In many cases, they are merely declaratory of principle. And the ILO conventions are exactly that&mdash;declaratory of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is morally moribund for the government to come into this chamber and say, `Look, we've signed this convention. Therefore, we have a legal international obligation to implement this stuff, which is binding and has the force of law.' That is utter garbage. Senator Sherry and all government senators ought to understand that&mdash;that these agreements, which are declaratory of principle, have no force of law. Nothing forces us to do anything as a result of them because they merely hold up a principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Senator Murphy interjects it is important to note that certain treaties in other jurisdictions&mdash;self-executory treaties&mdash;are such that the ratification of the treaty imports particular provisions of that agreement into the domestic law without an act of parliament. Those self-executing or self-executory treaties do not exist, or are not generally recognised in Australian domestic law. The only reason that there are countries that have those treaties is that they have a provision in their constitution which requires the ratification of a treaty by the parliament. For example, in the United States, the US High Court in a case known as Foster and Neilson ruled that there were these things called self-executing or self-executory treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason that those treaties have the force of law without further act of Congress to implement them is that, for the treaty to be ratified, it has to have the approval not just of the executive but of two-thirds of the US Senate. Even then there are very strict requirements of what is a self-executing treaty&mdash;what creates rights at domestic law as a result of the execution of those treaties. It goes to the substance of the treaty. The treaty has to specify the means by which the rights are going to be enforced, and the exact nature of the rights themselves. There is nothing in the ILO conventions which that mob opposite have signed&mdash;and they claim to have the force of law&mdash;that is anything like that. So it is totally and utterly dishonest for the government to say that these treaties have the force of law and that it has an obligation to implement these treaties. That is dishonest in the utmost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting when Senator Sherry said, `We don't have to tell the opposition we are going to sign a treaty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already established the fact that the government does not understand the nature of the treaties into which it has entered; we have already established the fact that these treaties do not have the force of law; we have already established the fact that this government is very rapidly, on its own thinking, ceding our authority overseas; and we have already established the fact that it is totally and utterly, politically and morally moribund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 seeks to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. One measure, the HECS, is completely and utterly abhorrent to the coalition. It is nothing more than a poorly disguised attempt to bring forward revenue collection to benefit the government's coffers early. There are no other winners, only losers, they being students and their employers. In effect, the government is issuing a garnishee against all HECS payers. This is a very serious matter, but one that seems to have escaped the Australian media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently HECS is included in annual assessments, but let us not forget that that sum is indexed with inflation so the government is not penalised by students paying in this manner. I ask: why has the government changed the rules after the initial contracts or agreements were made?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that under this legislation employers have been given extra responsibilities and failure to meet those responsibilities can result in a fine of up to $1,000. Employers are in business to make money, not help the government collect HECS debts. This measure is another step in the novel but repugnant process of getting everybody involved in helping the government collect tax. I need not remind honourable senators that the schools are now helping the ATO under a reward system to get students to sign up for TFN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has not demonstrated what was wrong with the previous system of collection. It will have to engage in a massive educational program&mdash;which has already started&mdash;at some cost to the revenue. I have received an important notice which was sent to all employers, and I think it is rather repugnant that the executive branch of government is issuing letters to employers and to HECS students in advance of the legislation passing this parliament. It is just not on. This government is overriding the rights of this parliament in issuing such letters. It should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously drawn the Senate's attention to this practice in relation to the superannuation guarantee legislation when a similar letter writing process was embarked upon on the assumption that legislation was going to pass unamended. I am astounded by the sheer arrogance of this government in using the ATO resources to produce a document when the tax legislation permitting this has not received assent. The government takes the passage of the legislation for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students will be stung by the PAYE system. If they fail to inform their employers to deduct the tax it will have to be deducted at 48.4 per cent, despite the fact that they may have a lower tax rate. This is nothing more than a penalty imposed on top of a graduate tax. Students who are just starting out in their careers are being slapped in the face every payday. There is also a problem because it means people who are under the provisional tax system will also have the HECS instalment added to the provisional tax factor. This will claw forward money to the extent of $12 million in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment concerns the benchmark interest used for calculating FBT on low interest loans to employers. The government has suddenly realised that the Commonwealth Bank's lowest rate has been well below the prevailing variable rates most borrowers were paying. Frankly, I am surprised that it took the government so long to realise that it was going to have a significant drop. This same thing occurred in 1992-93 before the previous bells were rung. This is going to further increase the government coffers by $60 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure ensures that non-compulsory occupation specific clothing is deductible. This is indeed a welcome move. We have seen many legislative amendments. We have seen them knocked out by the Edwards court decision in Queensland. We have seen some pretty unsatisfactory rulings and determinations. Unfortunately, yet again we have an amendment which is necessary because, unintentionally, occupational clothing which identifies both the wearer's employer and occupation was caught by the new rules and was denied a deduction. The amendment seeks to rectify that oversight, but it creates its own problems which I will mention a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final and most ludicrous of the three FBT measures attempts to fix up a complete disaster created by the government relating to entertainment expense. Currently, if an employee entertains a client on behalf of his employer he is reimbursed the full amount of the expenses included in the taxable value of the FBT to the employer. This bill does two things: the employer's share is deductible to the employer but is liable to FBT. The client's share is non-deductible but FBT exempt. </PARA>

<PARA>This report on the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is indeed a timely document by the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, Irene Moss. In her introduction to the report she points out that most Australians</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . take for granted the provision of clean, safe water and sanitation services.</PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed a shock for many Australians who live around the urban fringe, particularly along the east coast, and people who live in the larger rural centres, to be faced with the fact that in many remote areas adequate services do not exist, and that there is no guaranteed access to clean water or adequate sanitation. In particular, for many Aboriginal communities the standard of these services is no better than one would find in some of the poorest of the Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very contradiction is what began this report. Faced with the dilemma and the very different level of services available to most Australians compared with the small minority who live inland, the commissioner set about examining the events that led to her report. Basically the report seeks to find out why some people, particularly those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, are not receiving adequate water supplies. The report recommends what action needs to be taken to ensure that these issues are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out the difficulties in reaching a definitive conclusion or solution to the problems of water and sanitation supply. It begins this process by examining 10 case studies which range across all states and also include the Northern Territory. An attempt was made to try to assess the size of the problem, in particular by consulting with the communities to assess what changes need to take place, be they technical, attitudinal or bureaucratic changes, to improve the situation in order to make sure that all Australians have access to clean water and adequate sanitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report traces the social and historical contexts as well as the technical data relating to the provision of water and sanitation. It shows that despite the existence of mechanisms such as the Racial Discrimination Act, Aboriginal and Islander people do not have adequate access to basic human rights and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through 12 chapters the report explores the underlying issues that affect the provision of water and sanitation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The case studies provide an indictment of water quality, water supply and waste disposal in remote areas. It indicates that some 20,000 Aboriginal people live in communities where there is no adequate water supply. Those people have to rely on schemes that are insufficient for their needs and in many instances on unsafe supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows that we cannot allow ourselves to be blinded by technology. Indeed, inappropriate technology was instanced in the report as one of the causes of the problem. In one case study in my home state of South Australia, at Yalata, the technology became, in the words of the report a `bureaucratic nightmare', requiring expensive repair work and jeopardising the health and wellbeing of the Aboriginal people. The experience of the Yalata community showed that total dependence on one form of technology&mdash;in this particular case desalination&mdash;can be a disempowering and alienating experience for Aboriginal people. Throughout years of repairs to the equipment and delays, water quality was not tested and was uncertain. According to the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the health of the people became secondary to the technology itself.</PARA>
<PARA>This also raises the issue of self-determination and the need for Aboriginal people not just to be consulted, but to be involved in the decision-making process in ascertaining the type of service most appropriate to their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take on board the commissioner's call for a national statement on indigenous rights which, according to recommendation 3, is seen as a matter of urgency. Clearly the evidence contained in the report and recent health research indicate that the human rights of indigenous Australians are, as a minimum, being infringed. The final recommendation in the report relates to ongoing monitoring and review of the recommendations as well as the government's response to the report. This is an important landmark in the process of indigenous control of decision making and service provision. I look forward to swift and meaningful government action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the report by the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner relating to the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I wish to congratulate the commissioner, Irene Moss, and the people who put together this report, which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water,</EMPHASIS> on giving us a valuable and insightful document to peruse. The gross inequities that exist in Australia over the provision of two of the most basic of human needs&mdash;water and sanitation&mdash;are an indictment of our society. As Irene Moss says in the foreword to her report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may come as a shock for the highly-urbanised majority of Australians to realise that within their own country there are communities of people existing without the water and sanitation services usually taken for granted&mdash;struggling with conditions that an urban traveller may describe as `third world'.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is timely for a number of important reasons. First, it is timely because of the current focus that Aboriginal health issues are receiving, and more particularly the debate about the type of services to be provided. It has been interesting to see the community support for a reputed half a billion dollars expenditure in the budget on Aboriginal health funding. However, it is very disappointing when one looks closer at the matter to see in real terms how little is being provided for environmental health and primary health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Greens WA the level of funding for Aboriginal health in the federal budget is wholly inadequate. This report highlights pressing basic human needs, not luxuries. There is little point in providing more sophisticated health programs when people continue to die through lack of primary health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the report is important in light of the enormous publicity given to Aboriginal issues over the past couple of years since the Mabo High Court decision where Aboriginal people were on frequent occasions alleged as being singled out for disproportionately favourable treatment. If anyone in this country has seriously been arguing that Aboriginal people have had it easy in Australia, then this report should be compulsory reading. It outlines case studies that are the shame of Australia&mdash;aspects that we keep hidden from the rest of the world. If such cases were revealed we know that they would brand us as hypocrites whenever we speak of human rights and normal access to the civil requirements of an inhabitant of a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this report is timely because of the welcomed re-empowerment of Aboriginal communities that are returning to their traditional lands. If we want to help Aboriginal people to determine their own future, we must be willing to assist them in tangible ways. Many Aboriginal communities, even those close to towns and cities, are held back from development by anachronistic and inflexible planning laws and lack of funding. They are also hindered by a lack of responsibility by state governments, which use the excuse of federal funding as a way of escaping state obligations. The report points to constructive ways of dealing with the problem and I look forward to a comprehensive response from the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to speak on this report and draw attention to a number of quotations from it. In fact, I would like more time to comment on a number of the issues which were addressed in the report, but I will have to limit myself. On page 173 the comment is made:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the mindshifts and structural reforms required to support the provision of water and sanitation are such that if governments fail to address them, little change will occur.</PARA>
<PARA>To balance any tendency of governments to inaction, the commissioner considers it essential that an independent evaluation of progress be made on a regular basis. I had my own opportunity, just two weeks ago, to witness this inaction at first hand, during a visit to Palm Island in North Queensland. I might add that I have visited many Aboriginal communities in the last 30 years but this is the first time I had been to Palm Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the council and the chairperson Alf Lacey for their hospitality. During that visit they showed me the water supply for the island and the community, a most inadequate dam designed for a town of 1,600 people; a town which has had its population double in the last 10 years. There are now 3,500 people living in the vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three days before the last state election the government promised that it would instigate and institute a new water supply and a new dam. This was because the water supply at Palm Island had been affected by blue-green algae. The sad story is that although that promise was made before a state election, that dam has never been built. The only thing that is saving that community from the problem of blue-green algae at the moment is that heavy rain in North Queensland has meant the current dam is full to overflowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the problem is the constant breakdown of the sewerage system which, again, was built for a township about half its current size. The problem is that the three tiers of government do not seem to be able to get their act together. I must say that the criticism is not levelled at this stage at the federal government; it seems that the federal government certainly has been prepared to deliver the funds necessary. The breakdown seems to be somewhere between the state government and the local council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local council was simply unable to assist me on this matter because it had no information from the state government about when the dam was to be installed. I should mention that Palm Island is just off the coast of Townsville, which is certainly much closer to major population centres than most of the communities studied in this report. However, being an island off the coast, it is very much a case of out of sight, out of mind. One can imagine how much worse this is for communities that are far removed from the main cities and towns, such as those communities addressed in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate and I hope that all senators will read it. I also hope they will take note of what is said and realise that until we address basic issues such as water supply and sewerage systems, we will be unable&mdash;no matter how much money we spend&mdash;to do anything about the health of Aboriginal communities. That is not only a national disgrace but an international disgrace.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Senate was asked to debate a matter of urgency brought to the Senate by Senator Coulter in relation to sandmining in that area. I remember the matter very clearly because I was asked to speak on it with a couple of hours notice. Notwithstanding that, I know that I opposed the matter brought on by Senator Coulter, as did other opposition senators. But having read this document, I must say that I have reason to doubt the decision I made on that occasion because I do not believe that the Senate was apprised of all the relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I have concerns when I read in the summary report on page 27 an analysis of a number of scenarios for the treatment of the area. One of the scenarios is scenario C, `Exploration and mining over Pivot Mining NL lease areas 1 to 5'. This was the subject of the matter raised by Senator Coulter in 1992. At that time we on this side of the chamber were led to believe that there was no problem, that the government had approved these things and that no environmental danger arose from it. But the summary report says of scenario C:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scenario which was least compatible with maintaining the area's natural and cultural heritage values, renewable resources and environmental quality was Scenario C. However, this scenario is likely to provide the greatest economic returns, provided the assumptions underlying the predictions made in the economic models and of market forecasts are accurate. The validity of these predictions depends on the extent of mineral resources and their economic viability.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make further comments in relation to that scenario. That was considered the worst of four or five scenarios. I am starting to question the decision I made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reinforced in that by a number of documents now in my possession which I shall outline to the Senate. One is a letter from Tricontinental Holdings to the Queensland Minister for Tourism, Sport and Racing, dated 11 November 1992, which states that the obligations of Pivot Group and Q-West Group of companies to Tricontinental had been fully discharged. Attached is an amended statement of claim in relation to a matter between the Tricontinental Corporation Limited and others, and KMG Hungerfords and Peat Marwick Hungerfords, which shows that those liabilities in question appear to have amounted to some $80 million. </PARA>

That is ahead of Fraser Island, Noosa River, Moreton Island and the Daintree area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next document is headed `Background' which, I understand, is a cabinet document on which a decision was made in July 1990 recommending that the cabinet note that the advice from the Bureau of Mineral Resources was that the leases in question were economically marginal. The next document is a cover sheet of an agreement for mining leases between the Commonwealth of Australia and the state of Queensland, Pivot Projects Pty Ltd and Pivot Mining NL. The reason I seek to table that is that I also have in my possession a letter from the Australian state management to Mr Dan Gillespie who was secretary of the Commonwealth Commission of Inquiry in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That document outlines a number of concerns but it also says that the agreement should be viewed as a compensation agreement, which is something I do not quite understand. The significance appears to be that the Commonwealth would be paying money in relation to those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next document is a letter from the Water Resources Commission to the Secretary to the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories dated February 1990. It states that the environmental impact statement for the mining leases in question raised some concerns in relation to the hydrology of lease areas 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final letter is from the then minister for the environment to the Minister for Administrative Services dated February 1990, which outlines the basis for the minister's belief that the projects should go ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take only a few moments of the Senate's time this evening. I am pleased that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is present and I hope that he will refer the matter that I am raising to Senator Ray for an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been brought to my attention that the Department of Defence has put out a tender or in some way asked for quotes from people to upholster four of its chairs. I understand that the department has specified that the material to be used for upholstering the chairs is a Swiss fabric that would cost about $100 per metre wholesale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the tenders have gone to the ACT or to other places or whether the department has advertised for quotes, but that is not really the point. As I understand it, a comparable pure Australian wool upholstery fabric would be available at a wholesale price of about $35 a metre, which is considerably less than for the specified Swiss fabric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people would be fairly intrigued to think that the Department of Defence would need four chairs upholstered in a Swiss wool fabric when there are Australian wool fabrics available which could do the same job. I hope that the minister will look into this situation and find out whether that is the case? What happened to the Australian made program? What happened to the idea of `Buy your child a job: buy Australian?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Department of Defence has erred in seeking to have these chairs upholstered in Swiss fabric, it is a matter that the minister might like to discuss with the department. I hope that he will give the Senate an assurance that that is not the case, that the four chairs concerned will be suitably re-upholstered with Australian made wool fabrics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to briefly address an issue that was raised yesterday during question time in the House of Representatives relating to the fringe benefits tax. The question and the minister's natural response show the dilemma faced by many employers today in complying with the nation's tax laws where there are just so many grey areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the minister attempted to paint it as a black and white situation. That is where he fell into error. The minister made a knee-jerk response, which I suppose is not unusual in the House of Representatives. That knee-jerk response would have been made by most business people today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the tax office often takes a different view and, when it does, it advises people accordingly. The question is: who are we to believe? I believe it is now up to the tax office to issue a determination to clarify the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate also affords me the opportunity to mention a further dilemma faced by business people. The term `wages and employment' is used in different ways across a number of taxing jurisdictions, including ordinary pay, fringe benefits and the superannuation guarantee levy. There is a different definition of employee for fringe benefit purposes from the definition for the superannuation guarantee levy, which has a much wider scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that shortly after the superannuation guarantee levy came in even the tax office got its calculation wrong because it did not realise the implication of having visiting advisers running particular schools or sessions within the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the sorts of problems that people face. The superannuation guarantee levy, for example, includes bonuses, award payments and shift loadings but excludes overtime, payments in lieu of notice and payments for domestic work under 30 hours per week. These sorts of things are somewhat different when we are looking at fringe benefits tax. I also remind the Senate of some of the horrific increases that have occurred in what employers have to pay for. For example, a fringe benefit for a loss company can be something like 193 per cent of the tax cost. That is an incredible amount. I am saying that the after-tax cost varies considerably from taxpayer to taxpayer, which is quite inequitable. It depends on the status under which people choose to operate an entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than seeking that black and white simplistic response provided by Assistant Treasurer Gear, as the minister responsible for the tax office his answer should have focused on the nature of the employment arrangement, because that is the criteria that determines whether the fringe benefits tax applies. The purpose of the question was to clear up this grey area. This answer demonstrates how impossible it is for businessmen to get it right when the minister responsible for the tax office makes a knee-jerk, simplistic, black and white response. He should have responded to the question: what was the nature of the employment arrangement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One circumstance where the fringe benefits tax would be payable is when an employee uses the boss's car park within a kilometre of a commercial car park where the employment relationship was deemed to have existed. I doubt whether the minister would now be bold enough to ask the tax office to issue a public ruling or determination on the basis of his response yesterday. He should because his response has further confused the law. Why should people have to accept directives from the tax office contrary to the advice given in the parliament? I call upon the minister to ask the tax office to issue a public ruling or a determination on the basis of the response yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people welcomed his response because they thought it clarified the law. If it did clarify the law, so be it. But I remind Mr Gear that if he does this it will open up a pandora's box of tax avoiding schemes which he seemed to condemn in another answer to my colleague Mr Scott in the other House. So it was bad in one case so far as the farmer was concerned when he had to pay thousands of dollars in fringe benefits tax, but he failed to acknowledge the loophole that he was opening up in terms of the type of response that he gave yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I use this opportunity to remind the Assistant Treasurer that he perhaps should have used a more cautionary approach. Such a cautionary approach is certainly adopted by the minister who represents him in this place. It is very difficult to get an answer out of Senator Cook; he takes all questions on notice and comes back with a considered response. But I am not really condemning Mr Gear at all; I actually sympathise with the dilemma he had to face when trying to respond immediately and positively to only one of the hundreds of grey areas in taxation law which, I remind the Senate, the government itself created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under self-assessment, taxpayers have to get it right the first time. If they do not get it right the first time there are big penalties, culpability penalties, which range from 20 per cent up to 200 per cent with a start at 40 per cent if it is deemed to be a second offence. On top of that we have the interest component. Mr Gear has promised a review of the cost to business of compliance. I remind the Senate that the cost in terms of the FBT often far exceeds the revenue raised, but he said he will not make any changes that will diminish the amount of revenue so I wonder how cosmetic those changes will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in this year's budget the government expects to increase the revenue from fringe benefits tax by 131 per cent over that extracted from taxpayers last year. The government's own agencies in this area have a very real problem when trying to comply with and get the law itself right. If we are to accept Mr Gear's response literally, as he literally accepted the question that was thrown to him, then it would be easy to avoid liability by providing a whole host of cash benefits, accommodation, meals and transport. He is opening up a pandora's box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gear's view is somewhat inconsistent in view of what he is going to do with the poor old public benevolent agencies. As we know, at the moment they are one of the few groups that are excluded, but Mr Gear will put a cap on the fringe benefits payable by these people. I remind the Senate, however, that other groups and bodies such as religious institutions, scientific, charitable or public education institutions, community service organisations, trade unions and hospitals get a 48 per cent rebate from their fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that this is an issue that I believe needs clarification at the appropriate level. If Mr Gear is right, he must issue a tax determination to clarify it. I think it is perhaps up to the tax office to refund that money which it took by default from other people who paid tax when the law was obviously wrong. All these rules and grey areas create administrative nightmares for employers.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address tonight an issue which is currently in the public eye; that is, the question of decriminalisation of various drugs, in particular marijuana. Of course, the issue has been raised because of the motion passed at the recent AMA conference that marijuana should be decriminalised. I would like to say a few things about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of precepts are involved in the whole question. The first, which is often put by the protagonists of the case for decriminalisation, is that marijuana is not a harmful drug. Let me say that the very best case scenario is that it is as bad or as harmful as tobacco. Would we now, if tobacco were suddenly discovered in the 20th century, legalise tobacco use knowing what we know about its health effects? Clearly the answer is no. I accept that that horse has now bolted, and it probably did so 700 years ago in Walter Raleigh's day. The fact is that is the very best case scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real case scenario is much worse than that. There is little doubt at all that there is a predilection for the inducement or precipitation of schizophrenia by the use of marijuana. A number of studies support this view. One particular study, a 15-year study of 55,000 Swedish military conscripts from the late 1980s, showed that the relative risk of developing schizophrenia was six times higher for heavy users of marijuana than for non-users. A number of other studies support this view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many doctors will anecdotally state that the commonest cause, particularly in the 15- to 25-year-old age group, of schizophrenia seems to be related at least in onset time to the use of or experimentation with marijuana. It is worse than tobacco. In carcinogenic&mdash;that is, cancer producing&mdash;effects, it is probably at least as bad as tobacco, but of course marijuana is usually smoked without the benefit of a filter so the carcinogens have the potency to reach the affected areas, normally the lungs and other areas, in higher concentrations. So there is no doubt that it is worse than tobacco as it is actually used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of data on the effects of marijuana on motor coordination. By itself that may not be harmful but, of course, people with poor motor coordination still drive vehicles. One of the major problems that we have with alcohol is someone using alcohol in excess and then driving motor vehicles and causing damage not only to themselves but to other people on the roads or nearby. There is good evidence that motor coordination is impaired such that driving vehicles is dangerous in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a report in 1990 from the United States National Transportation Safety Board which showed extensive evidence linking fatal accidents among truck drivers to cannabis. One-third of the victims whose bodies were examined had recently used alcohol or drugs. Almost 13 per cent had used marijuana. That is a very high and very clear association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some evidence that head and neck cancers are more common in marijuana users. A study published in 1991 showed that of 12 cases&mdash;admittedly a small number&mdash;of advanced head and neck cancer in young patients with an average age of 26 years, which is very young for head and neck cancer, all had been daily marijuana smokers since high school but did not smoke tobacco or use much alcohol, these being two of the other major risk factors for head and neck cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are cardiovascular effects in terms of blood pressure and a whole range of other effects. These things are beyond dispute. There is no doubt that marijuana is harmful in health terms. There might be some disagreement as to how extensive that damage is, but in health terms there is no question that it is damaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other damaging problems. In the current environment marijuana is often sold and obtained in situations where other drugs, hard drugs&mdash;if we want to use that expression&mdash;are available. Nobody I am aware of is seriously suggesting that we should provide marijuana in tobacconists' shops, so presumably the provision of marijuana in the existing environment will continue. That is a first step in the utilisation of drugs full stop, particularly drugs which may then progress to the harder, even more damaging drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is I think a broad amount of agreement among many people, certainly among the majority of people, that marijuana should be discouraged. The question really is how do we discourage use? How do we best achieve this end? The AMA's view is that we should do two things: one is decriminalise and the other is educate. I have no real problem with the principle of education, but the aim should not be education after the event; the aim should be for education before the event to make sure that children in particular are well informed and, hopefully, therefore less likely to want to try the drug in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If over half our people smoke tobacco, and that is what the statistics suggest at present, it is indeed a short step that once marijuana is decriminalised experimentation with cannabis will be that much easier and that much more attractive, especially when one considers that the vast majority of marijuana users include in their joint tobacco from their cigarette, and that of course will add to health risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have major problems about the process of education used as a stopgap. It needs to be done across the whole board. By itself it is not enough. I have major reservations about the main question here which is the decriminalisation of marijuana. The main problem is that it gives a very clear message to the community, in particular to the young in our community, that we are condoning the use of marijuana and that we are in some way saying it is not that bad. We are perhaps saying it is something which they should not necessarily avoid, that they might want to experiment with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message it gives is the wrong message entirely, particularly to young people in our society. We need to give a very clear message that not only marijuana but every other drug should be avoided. Even the use of drugs such as alcohol&mdash;because, of course, alcohol is a drug&mdash;should be minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the AMA, which in so many ways, particularly during the last year under the presidency of Brendan Nelson, has done such a lot to broaden its horizons and to encourage good public health issues such as anti-smoking, inappropriate alcohol use, road traffic accidents and a few other issues as well, including the not inconsiderable importance of Aboriginal health considerations, in this one area is saying, `Okay, it may well be harmful, but what we will look at is decriminalisation.' What it is doing there is giving a message that it is okay. I am completely opposed to this tacit endorsement of drug use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the arguments that is put forward is that a criminal record will adversely affect a young person's life. I agree; I do not particularly want to see young people thrown in gaol or have a criminal record. But what I want to see even less is a population of young children suffering the harmful effects of smoking marijuana which I outlined earlier. That is a much more important issue. A drug that is illegal will deter at least some people from using it. That deterrent will at least serve to protect society in some way. It may mean lives saved from usage and the effects of that usage. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect about a criminal record is that nobody is forced to smoke marijuana; nobody is forced to take on a criminal record. Sad though I am about the need for this, it is absolutely crucial that we take a very firm stance in our society against any endorsement or any condoning of drug use  in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect, of course, which is sometimes raised is the specious argument that having a criminal association with marijuana, making it illegal, in some way has not worked. The speciousness of that argument is clearly illustrated by the fact that if we look at murder, which has been a crime for as long as I am aware, people still commit murder. So no veto, of course, can ever be complete. The question is: does it reduce the usage? There can be little doubt that it does. I am therefore very strongly of the view that we should not decriminalise marijuana, not give this message to our youth, and that we should take a very firm stance as a society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak on this matter not only as a doctor with good friends in the AMA who have taken this view, but as a politician and, perhaps most importantly of all, as the father of three children. I do not want to give any encouragement to my children or to any of the children with whom I come into contact to become in any way dependent in the slightest fashion upon the use of any drug, particularly marijuana, but the same applies to tobacco, alcohol and a whole range of other drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our society has changed dramatically in the last 10 years. If we look around restaurants now, it is rare to see people smoking. If we go to meetings, it is rare to see people smoking. There has been a swing in society against the misuse of our bodies. So why we would want to go in the opposite direction on this issue is completely beyond my comprehension. I feel very strongly about this issue. I am very disappointed that the AMA, which has been, as I say, so good in leading opinion in so many other ways over the last year or so, has in my view taken entirely the wrong step in this issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy answered a similar question (No 1163 of 14 March 1994) on this issue from Senator Bell and this answer adds to the response from the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)&mdash;(6) Following the decision resulting in the termination of Stage 2 of the GBF power development scheme, the Commonwealth and Tasmania agreed on financial assistance measures to ameliorate the impact of the decision on Tasmanian electricity costs and employment. The terms of this financial agreement are set out in a 1984 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Commonwealth and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MOU provides that the Commonwealth make a number of payments to the State, namely an ex gratia payment related to Tasmania's expenditure on the GBF, an electricity subsidy, and grants for employment generating projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ex gratia payment of $25m to Tasmania effectively reimbursed the State for expenditures by the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC) of Tasmania for its past expenditures on the GBF development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electricity subsidy consists of ten annual payments of $20m as adjusted for price changes. These funds were to be used by the HEC as a subsidy to reduce the cost of producing 112 Megawatts (MW) of electricity to the cost equivalent of the electricity that would have been produced by the GBF scheme. The MOU recognised that the King River Power Development and the Anthony Power Development schemes represented replacement 112MW of electricity that would have been produced by the GBF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last electricity subsidy was paid in 1992-93.

The funds have been used by the HEC to finance capital expenditure on the King River and Anthony power developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MOU also provides that, if the need is demonstrated for a further 68MW of electricity, representing the balance of capacity that would have been provided by the GBF scheme, then the Commonwealth and Tasmania will negotiate on arrangements to provide a subsidy in respect of this 68MW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of grants for employment generation, the Commonwealth and Tasmania agreed initially on a schedule of projects and funding to be allocated to each part of the schedule.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These grants proceed on the basis that Tasmania undertakes expenditure on a project and this is reimbursed by the Commonwealth. The Department of Finance is currently considering Tasmania's final claim for reimbursement of expenditure on these projects.

The components of this assistance package represent the priorities of both the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments in resolving the termination of the GBF scheme. In this context, the principal factor in any assessment of the Commonwealth's contribution to the assistance package is whether the Commonwealth met all its undertakings as required by the agreement and therefore whether the Commonwealth has successfully contributed to the achievement of both its and the State's priorities. As described above, the Commonwealth has fulfilled its requirements.</PARA>

The PBAC recommended that alternative supply arrangements to the PBS for these products be considered and recommended that they be removed from the Scheme if feasible.
